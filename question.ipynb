See 2024 WL 3291790\\n(S.S.A. June 6, 2024);  89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June 6, 2024). The ruling  explains how SSA evaluates\\npast relevant work (PRW ) at step four of the sequential evaluation process in establishing  disability\\nunder titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations.  See pages\\n42-43, 59-66 for arg uments based on SSR 24-2p.    \\nSSR 24-2p provides guidance on whether an individual retains the RFC to perform the demands of\\ntheir PRW  at step four, in a “question and answer” format that answers the following  questions:\\n1.How do we define past relevant work ( PRW ?\\nSSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that an individual has performed: (1) within the past five\\nyears; (2) that was substantial gainful activity  (“SGA”) as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1571\\n- 404.1575 and §§ 416.971-416.975; and (3) that lasted long enoug h for the individual to\\nlearn to do the work.  However, work that the individual started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days is not considered PRW  under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)-(ii) and\\n416.960(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\\n2.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work was performed within the past 5\\nyears?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured from the date\\nof the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  I n some situations, the relevant period\\nis measured from an earlier date. See SSR 18-1p: Titles II and XVI: Determining the\\nEstablished Onset Date (EOD)  in Disability Claims , which identifies the most common\\ntypes of disability  claims and some of the regulations that explain the non-medical\\nrequirements for those types of claims. See also POMS DI 25001.001 Medical and\\nVocational Quick Reference Guide. The ruling  includes a table that provides guidelines for\\ncommon scenarios.\\n3.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days?\\nSSR 24-2p provide s that work is not PRW  if an individual started and stopped it in fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days, defined as a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends,\\nstarting  from the first day of work .  SSA generally  does not consider the total number of\\nhours or days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or part-time. \\nThe 30 calendar days requirement is separate from the consideration of SGA or whether an\\nindividual worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days\\nmay count toward the time needed for an individual to learn to do the work. \\nxiv\\nMoreover, if an individual was self-employ ed or an independent contractor, SGA will\\nconsider whether the individual was engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days,\\neven if individual work assig nments or contr acts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.\\nExamples of different scenarios are provided in the ruling , including  in footnote 14, which\\nexplains PRW includes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or\\nmore because the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even thoug h each\\nindividual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. \\n4.How do we determine whether an individual performed work long enough to learn to do it?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that the individual gained sufficient\\njob experience to learn the techniques, acquire information, and develop the facility  needed\\nfor averag e performance in the job.  The length of time this would take depends  on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific vocational\\npreparation (SVP).\\n5.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW ?\\nThere are two methods used to determine whether an individual can perform his or her PRW  \\n– whether they can perform the work as “actually  performed or as generally  performed in\\nthe national economy.”  “As they actually  performed it” looks to whether the individual\\nretains the RFC to perform the particular functional demands peculiar to the work the\\nindividual did.  “As it is generally  performed in the national economy ” looks to whether the\\nindividual retains the capacity  to perform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily\\nrequired throug hout the national economy , based on descriptions of occupations from\\nreliable sources of job information or from a vocational specialist or vocational ex pert. \\n6.How do we determine whether an individual can perform their PRW  as they actually\\nperformed it?\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work are generally\\nsufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental demands of such work.   \\nHowever, if the individual cannot provide this information, with the individual’s permission,\\nSSA will attempt get it from their employ er or another person who knows about  the\\nindividual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the individual to\\ntell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless the job started and stopped\\nin fewer than 30 calendar day s), including :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the individual did\\nduring  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of their work.\\n7.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW  as it is generally performed\\nin the national economy?\\nxv\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform their PRW  as it is generall y performed\\nin the national economy , SSA considers whether the individual retains the capacity  to\\nperform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily  required throug hout the national\\neconomy .  SSA may rely on descriptions of occupations  from reliable sources of job\\ninformation to determine how occupations are generally  performed. A vocational specialist\\nor vocational expert may also provide information about how an occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform a job as actually  performed, an\\nindividual’s job may have involved functional demands that are different from those\\ngenerally  required for the occupation throug hout the national economy . If the individual\\ncannot meet the functional demands actually  required in the former job but can meet the\\nfunctional demands as generally  required throug hout the economy, we will find the\\nindividual able to perform PRW  and not disabled.\\n8.How do we obtain evidence concerning an individual’s work history?\\nAn individual is the primary  source for infor mation concerning  their work history , but we\\nconsider all available evidence and information. Statements by the individual about their past\\nwork are generally  sufficient for deter mining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. If the individual cannot give us all the information we need, we may\\ntry, with the individual’s permission, to get it from their employ er or another person who\\nknows about the individual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nWe will ask the individual to tell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless\\nthe job started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days). The individual must tell us the\\ndates they worked, the duties they performed, and any tools, machinery , and equipment they\\nused. We will need to know the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing\\nthe individual did during  the workday , as well as any  other phy sical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\n9.What information do we require when determining whether work is PRW  that an individual\\ncan perform?\\nThis may include detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental demands,\\nand other job requirements. Information concerning  dates work was performed, tools and\\nmachines used, the extent of supervision required, and a descrip tion of tasks and\\nresponsibilities, may be needed to determine whether the work is PRW  that the individual\\ncan perform. If more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, SSA will request\\nseparate descriptions of each job the individual performed during  the relevant period. SSA\\nwill g ive careful consideration to:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no long er be met\\nand the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those requirements;\\n•the individual’s RFC (20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 and 416.945 and SSR 96-8p Assessing\\nResidual Functional Capacity in Initial Claims );  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corroborative information from other sources on the\\nxvi\\nrequirements of the work as actually  performed by the individual or as generally\\nperformed in the economy .\\n10. What findings and rationale must our determination or decision include when we find an\\nindividual is able to perform PRW ?\\nA determination or decisio n that an individual is not disabled, based on their ability  to\\nperform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, must contain adequate rationale and finding s.\\nIn finding  that an individual has the capacity  to perform PRW , the determination or decision\\nmust:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the individual\\nactually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in the national\\neconomy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in\\nthe national economy .\\nSSR 24-1p - HOW WE APPLY  MEDICAL-V OCATIONAL PROFILES\\nEffective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  , How We Apply Medical-Voc ational Profiles,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63, Medical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an\\nAdjustment to Other Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48477 (June\\n6, 2024).  This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three medical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous\\nunskilled work profile;  (2) no work profile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing\\ndisability  under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations. \\n \\nThese three profiles repres ent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two profiles, the\\nlifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but only as it pertained to claimants with\\nvisual impairments.2  This profile was  incorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the\\nrequirements and is not limited to claimants with visual impairments.  The lifetime commitment \\nprofile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .       \\n2 SSR 85- 15 pr ovides that:\\na finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant’s\\nvocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education\\nor less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.\\nxvii\\nSSR   is set up in a “question and answer” format, and answers the following  questions:\\n1.When do we consider the medical-vocational profiles in the sequential evaluation process?\\nSSA will use SSR  on and after its applicable d ate in any case in which the agency makes\\na determination or decision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for\\nfurther administrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR , SSA will apply  this\\nruling  to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. An\\nindividual can only  be found disabled based on a medical-vocational profile if a finding  at\\nstep four has been made that they do not have or are unable to perform their PRW .  At step\\nfive, an adjudicator must consider whether a medical-vocational profile applies before using\\nthe medical-vocational g uidelines.\\n2.What are the requirements of the arduous unskilled work profile?\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is not working at SGA level (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 404.1572, 416.910 and\\n416.072); \\n•has a history of 35 years or more of arduous unskilled work (see 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1568 and 416.968); \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s) (see\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1522 and 416.922); and \\n•has no more than a marg inal education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564 and 416.964). \\n \\nSSR 24-1p notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types of jobs, and that generally\\nSSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade level or less is a marg inal education.\\nHowever, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not reflect their\\nactual educational abilities.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b). The ruling  also\\ncites to SSR 20-1p: Titles II and XVI: How We Determine an Individual’s Education\\nCategory , which is discussed, infra  at xxxi.  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is used for an individual whose work experience includes\\nvery short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work, as long as the individual did not acquire\\nany transferable skills from those periods of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968.\\nSSA considers occupations with specific vocational preparation (“SVP”) levels one and two\\nto be unskilled, three and four to be semi-skille d, and five or greater to be skilled.  See\\nPOMS DI 25015.015 Work Experience as a Vocational Factor , and DOT Appendix  C.  See\\nalso SSR 00-4p Use of Vocational Expert and Vocational Specialist Evidence , and Other\\nReliable Occupational Informati on in Disability  Decisions.  See pages 69, infra, for a\\ndiscussion of SVP levels. The ruling also cites to SSR 82-41: Work Skills and Their\\nTransferability as Intended by the Expanded Vocational Factors Regulations for additional\\ninformation about how SSA considers skills from past work under its rules.  See page 122,\\ninfra , for a discussion of SSR 82-41.  \\nxviii\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also used for an individual whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired is not readily\\ntransferable to lig hter work.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as physical work requir ing a high level of streng th or\\nendurance.  Arduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or exertional\\nlevel, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical demands that we would classify\\nas heavy  or very heavy  based on the individual’s description of their past work. See 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1567 and 416.967.  Work that SSA would not classify  as heavy  or very heavy\\nmay still be considered arduous if, for example, it demands a great deal of stamina or if it\\ninvolves activity  such as repetitive bending  and lifting at a very fast pace.  An adjudicator\\nmust evaluate the record to make the ultimate finding  as to whether an individual’s work\\nmeets this criterion.\\n3.What are the requirements of the no work profile, and do we consider an individual’s RFC\\nwhen determining whether an individual meets this profile?\\nThe no work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other work for an\\nindividual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964).\\n,\\nSSR 24-1p provides that SSA adjudicators do not need to assess or consider RFC when\\napply ing the no work profile.  The ruling  notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA\\nconsiders any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment(s) that meet s the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairment, citing  to SSR 03-3p: Policy Interpretation\\nRuling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and Blindness in Initial Claims for\\nIndividuals 65 or Older  and citing  to SSR 23-1p:  Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement\\nfor Disability , discussed infra at xx, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p states that “limited education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills, but not enoug h to allow an individual with these educational qualifications\\nto do most of the more complex  job duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.  Generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal education is a limited\\neducation.  However, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not\\nreflect their actual educational abilities. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b); see\\nalso SSR 20-01p, How We Determine An Individual’s Education Category , discussed infra\\nat xxxi. \\n4.What are the requirements of the lifetime commitment profile, and how does the lifetime\\ncommitment profile apply to an individual who has worked at multiple jobs or for multiple\\nemployers?\\nSSR 24-1p states that the lifetime commitment profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nxix\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older) ( see 20 C.F.R. §§ 1563\\nand 416.963); \\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level;\\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s). \\nFor purposes of the lifetime commitment profile, the individual’s 30 years o f work do not\\nhave to have been at only one job or for only one employ er.  The jobs must have been in one\\nfield of work, meaning  that the types of work the individual performed must have been very\\nsimilar to one another.  Use of this medical-vocational profile is appropriate even if the\\nindividual has work experience in a field(s) other than the one in which they have a 30-year\\nlifetime commitment, as long as the work experience in the other field(s) is not PRW  that\\nthe individual is still able to perform considering  their RF C.\\nSSR 23-1p - DURATION REQUIREMENT FOR DISABILITY\\nEffective November 7, 2023, Social Security  Ruling 23-1p, Duration Requirement for Disability ,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-52, regarding  the duration of the impairment. The ruling  explains how\\nthe duration requirement is measured and defined, how it affects the sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess, and how SSA makes a finding  about the expected duration of an impairment. It addresses\\nhow duration is considered in continuing  disability  review cases when the beneficiary  or recipient\\nhas a new, severe medically  determined physical or mental impairment. It explains what will happen\\nif SSA learns of a return to substantial gainful employ ment within 12 months of a claimant’s onset\\nof disability . See 2023 W L 8236247 (S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023). \\nSSR 23-1p is set up in “question and answer” format and answers the following  questions: \\n1.How does a claimant meet the duration requirement for disability ? \\n2.What is a medically  determinable impairment (MDI ) that “can be expected to result in\\ndeath”?  \\n3.What do we mean by  “12 continuous months” and how do we measure it in initial claims?\\n4.How does the duration requirement affect  the five-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess?  \\n5.How does the duration requiremen t affect the three-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess for Title XVI  claimants who have not y et attained 18 y ears of ag e? \\n6.How do we consider the duration requirement when the claimant has new, severe MDI (s)\\nin continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases?  \\n7.What if we find that the claimant meets the duration  requirement based on an expectation\\nof continued severity , but the claimant returned to SGA within 12 months?  \\nxx\\nSSR 22-1p AND SSR 22-2P ADDRESSING FRAUD AND \\nSIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS \\n(formerly SSR 16-1p and 16-2p) \\nEffective May 17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p addressing Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and rescinded and replaced SSR 16-2p, addressing  the\\nEvaluation of Claims Involving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-\\n2p. Each of these new ruling s chang e the evidentiary  standard from “preponderance of the evidence”\\nto “reason to believe” and provide that before SSA will disreg ard evidence under the Act at the\\nhearing s level of the administrative review process,  the individual’s objection to the disreg arding\\nof that evidence will be considered, among  other chang es more fully discussed in the arguments\\nregarding  the new ruling s, infra, at pag es 238-47. \\nSSA stated in issuing  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p that the agency expects that these revised\\nprocedures will allow implementation of relevant sections of the Social Security  Act in a manner\\nconsistent with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the\\nprocedures outlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. These challeng es were based on principles\\nof constitutional due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, as discussed in the detailed\\ndescriptions of these ruling s, infra  at pag es 238-47.\\nREGULATORY  CHANGE OF  THE DEFINITION OF PAST RELEV ANT WORK BY\\nREDUCING THE RELE VANT PERIOD FROM 15 Y EARS TO FIV E YEARS \\nThe SSA has issued a final rule effective June 8, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to the Disability\\nAdjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work, 89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024). \\nThe effective date was subsequently  deferred to June 22, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).  The rule revises the definition of past relevant work (PRW ) by reducing  the relevant work\\nperiod from the current 15 years to five years.  The rule notes that this often reduces the number of\\njobs in an individual’s work history  that SSA will consider at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess when determining  whether an individual can perform PRW .  On J une 25, 2024, SSA also\\nissued Emerg ency Messag e 24028, providing supplemental instructions for res judicata policy\\napplication, considering  the chang e to the regulatory  definition of past relevant work, discussed infra\\nat xxiii.\\nAt step five, this revision will also change the previous work experience that SSA will consider\\nunder the Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  Because a step four finding  can result in a denial but not\\nan allowance, SSA anticipates making  proportionally  fewer denial decisions at step four and\\nproportionally  more decisions at step five and expects that shifting  decisions from step four to step\\nfive with less past work considered will result in more allowance decisions. \\nThis final rule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability  review\\n(CDR) cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial disabil ity sequential\\nevaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no longer consider past work that started and\\nstoppe d in fewer than 30 calendar days to be PRW .  The rule also notes that in the Notice of\\nProposed Rule Making  (NPRM) for this rule, SSA proposed to remove a current sentence in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a) and 416.965(a) that explains the intent of the work experience rules is to\\nxxi\\n“ensure that remote work experience is not currently  applied” in order to reflect that the arduous\\nunskilled work profile and the lifetime commitment profile consider work history  for a period long er\\nthan the proposed five year relevant work period; the final rule notes this chang e was made in 88\\nFed. Reg . 83877 (Dec. 1, 2023).  \\nSSA makes these revisions in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and 416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years that was substantial\\ngainful activity  and that lasted long  enoug h for you to learn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We\\nwill not consi der work to be past relevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than\\n30 calendar day s (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consid er past relevant work and work experience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar\\ndays means a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day\\nof work.  When we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or day s worked during  that period, or whether the work\\nwas full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days requir ement is separate from the\\nconsideration of substantial gainful activity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn\\nhow to do the work, althoug h the work performed during  the 30 calenda r days may count\\ntoward the time needed for y ou to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar days requirement\\nalso applies if you were self-employ ed or an independent contractor; we will consider\\nwhether you were engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual\\nwork assig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a): \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 4 16.965(a) from the prior text, “If you\\nhave no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for brief periods of time during  the\\nfive-y ear period, we generally  consider that these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as,\\n“If you have no work experience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear period, we\\ngenerally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the justification for the rule is to\\nallow individuals to focus on the most current and relevant information about their past\\nwork, better reflect the current evidence base on chang es over time in worker skill decay  and\\njob responsi bilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service, and reduce the\\nburden on individuals. \\nNew  SSR 24-2p and Rescissions : Pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-2p - Titles\\nII and XVI: How We Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effective June 22, 2024, which rescinds SSR 86-\\n8, and rescinds and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose of SSR 24-2p is to explain\\nhow SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform\\nthe demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy  set forth in SSA’s\\nregulations so that those regulations will be consi stently applied. See SSR 24-2p –  How We\\nEvaluate Past Relevant Work, 2024 WL 3291790 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June\\n6, 2024), discussed at pag es xiv-xvii, supra . \\nxxii\\nNew  SSR 24-1p and Rescissions: Also pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-1p,\\nTitles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , effective June 22, 2024, which\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63 .  The purpose of SSR  24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the\\nthree medical-vocational profiles - (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2)  no work profile; and (3)\\nlifetime commitment profile. These profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them\\nwill be found to be unable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process\\nwithout reference to the medical-vocational guidelines. The ruling  describes the profiles as follows:\\n1.Arduous unskilled work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\n \\n2.No work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education.  \\n3.Lifetime commitment profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older);\\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s).\\nSSR 24-1p, Titles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Vocational Profiles , 2024 WL 3291789\\n(S.S.A.

See, Intermediate Improvement to the Disability Adjudication Process, Including\\nHow We Consider Past Work; Deferral of Effective Date , 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).\\nThe EM notes that the new PRW  rule provides a new and less restrictive definition of PRW ,\\nsee 20 C.F.R. § 404.1560(b)(1), and SSR 24-2p. The new definition is less restrictive in two\\nways:  (1) The relevant period conside rs 5 years rather than 15 years of past work, and (2)\\nWork that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2.Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe EM notes that administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided,\\nit does not need to be decided again.  Res judicata is applied at all levels of the adjudication\\nprocess to avoid deciding  an issue that has previously  been decided based on the same facts,\\nsame issues, same parties, and same adjudicative period and is applicable only with respect\\nto the period covered by the prior final determination or decision.  The end of this period will\\ngenerally  correspond to the date of the prior final determination or decision, except when the\\ndate the claimant last met the non-disability  requirements for entitlement expired prior to the\\ndate of the final determination or decision.\\n3. Policy\\nThe EM announ ces SSA will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously\\nadjudicated period when the prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found\\nthe individual could do:  \\n1) PRW at step four of the sequential evaluation process and the PRW  cited is not PRW\\nunder the PRW  rule; OR\\n2)Other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process , work experience was\\nmaterial to the decision, and the individual’s work experience is different under the PRW\\nrule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, SSA will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or\\ndismiss a request for hearing  on that claim.\\nThe EM provides procedures and g uidance for SSA staff in implementing  this policy .4\\n4Editor’s Note: In the limited circumstances where a case has received a final determination, and the new\\nPRW rules would have resulted in a favorable outcome, representatives may wish to consider filing a new\\napplication instead of additional appeals in light of EM- 24028.

It provides guidance on how this new\\npolicy  will be applied to potential collateral estoppel claims currently  pending  at various listed\\nagency  offices.  The EM states: \\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of disability  in a subsequent\\nclaim by the same individual for a different disability  benefit or SSI payments if, in our prior\\nfinal determination or decision, we have already  decided that the individual is disabled for\\nthe period in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1. Both the prior determination or decision and new claim require application of the same\\nstatutory  definition of disability .\\n2. We have not made an intervening  medical determination or decision findin g that the\\nindividual’s disability  ceased.\\n3. The individual has not engaged in substantial gainful activity  since the prior established\\nonset date (EOD) \\n4. The EOD in the prior claim is on or before the date when the nonmedical requirements\\nfor entitlement are last met in the new claim.\\n5. The record with the prior favorable disability determination or decision is not in\\nterminated status.\\n6. We do not have reason to believe that the prior disability  determination or decision was\\nwrong .\\nThe new policy  applies to subsequent claims and appeals filed on or after the effective date; to initial\\nclaims and appeals pending  as of the effective date; and to closed claims in which SSA or the\\nclaimant “questioned the agency ’s prior final determination or decision in writing ” within one year\\nof the date of the notice of the initial determination.\\n“Questioning  the determination or decision in writing ” occurs when claimant files a subsequent\\nclaim for the same benefit alleging an onset date within the period adjudicated by the prior\\ndetermination or decision; or claimant otherwise indicates in writing that they disag ree with the\\ndetermination or decision; or SSA indicates in writing  that it is considering  reopening  and revising\\nthe determination or decision.\\nTo meet the one-y ear requirement a subsequent application, other written request for reopening\\n(express or implied), or other written expression of disagreement with the prior determination or\\ndecision must be made within one year of the date of the notice of the initial determination; and the\\nquestioning  must either occur after or be pending  a response from SSA as of the effective date.\\nA subsequent claim for a previously  denied benefit is considered an implied request to reopen the\\nprior determinatio n or decision when the claimant alleg es an onset date of disability  within the\\npreviously  adjudicated period.

The ruling  went into effect on April 27, 2020, the same day  new reg ulations\\nwere issued which removed “inability  to communicate in English” as an education categ ory. See 85\\nFed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020). Now SSA will have four education categ ories at step five of the\\nsequential evaluation process:\\n1)High school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nskills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level or above” which generally\\npermits performance of semi-skilled throug h skilled work.\\n2)Limited education – some reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills abilities acquired\\nthroug h a 7th – 11th grade education, but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job\\nduties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.”\\n3)Marginal education – reasoning,  arithmetic, and language skills abilities needed for\\nsimple, unskilled jobs, g enerally  a 6th grade education or less.\\n4)Illiteracy – defined as “an inability to read or write” even simple messag es like\\ninstructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can sign his or her name. Generally\\nxxxi\\nhas little or no formal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p also acknowledg es that other evidence may show a higher or lower level of education\\nthan formal schooling  level would suggest. Examples of the evidence used are “past work\\nexperien ce, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily  activities,\\nhobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and vocational training . Another factor that SSA\\nmay consider is an extensive history  of special education, which can show in a particular case that\\nthe individual’s educational abilities are lower than the grade completed.  This ruling  amends the\\nfollowing  regulations:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964 and 20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines\\nHEARINGS HELD BY  ADMINISTRATIV E APPEALS JUDGES\\nOF THE APPEALS COUNCIL\\n \\nUnder a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA revised its rules to clarify  when and how\\nadministrative appeals judges (AAJ) on the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisions.\\nSee Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 F ed. Reg . 73138\\n(Nov. 16, 2020). Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the authority  to hold hearing s\\nand issue decisions under the existing  statute and regulations, but SSA had not exercised this\\nauthor ity or explained the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals\\nCouncil to assume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\nThe clarifications made by the rule ensure the Appeals Council is not limited in the type of claims\\nfor which it may hold hearing s. The stated goal of the rule is to increase adjudicative capacity  when\\nneeded, allowing  quicker adjustment to fluctuating  short-term workloads, such as when an influx\\nof cases reaches the hearing s level. The final rule amends or revises the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Rem oval of a hearing request(s) to the Appeals\\nCouncil)  provides that the “Appea ls Council may assume responsibility  for a hearing\\nrequest(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the administrative review process” and requires\\nsending  a “notice to all parties that the Appeals Council has assumed responsibility  for the\\ncase(s).” The Appeals Council is required to conduct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, applicab le to SSDI  claims and 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461, applicable to SSI claims.  Appeals Council review may be requested by any party\\ndissatisfied with the hearing  decision or with the dismissal of a hearing  request, following\\nthe procedures in §§ 404.967 throug h 404.982 for SSDI  claims and §§ 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461 for SSI claims.  The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judge who conducted\\na hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismissed a hearing  request will not participate in\\nany action associated with the request for Appeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.983, 416.1483 (Case remanded by a Federal court)  provides that when\\na Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, one option\\nlisted in the regulations is for the Appeals Council to schedule a hearing. The Appeals\\nCouncil may  take any  of these actions: \\nxxxii\\n•make a decision either without a hearing ; \\n•make a decision with a hearing ; \\n•dismiss the proceeding s, ex cept in limited circumstances; or \\n•remand the case to an ALJ “with instructions to take action and issue a decision or\\nreturn the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision.\\n If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility  for issuing  a decision and “a hearing  is\\nnecessary  to complete adjudication of the claim(s), an administrative appeals judge will hold\\na hearing  using  the procedures set forth in §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, as applicable.”  See\\n20 C.F .R.§§ 416.1429 throug h 416.1461, for the reg ulations applicable to SSI  claims. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.984, 416.1484 (Appeals Council review  of hearing decision in a case\\nremanded by a Federal court)  provi des that the decision of the ALJ or administrative\\nappeals judge will become the final decision of the Commissioner after remand unless the\\nAppeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case based on written exceptions to the decision\\nfiled with the Appeals Council or based on its authority  to hold a hearing . If no ex ceptions\\nare filed and the Appeals Counc il does not assume jurisdiction, the decision of the\\nadministrative law judg e or administrative appeals judg e becomes the final decision of the\\nCommissioner after remand. \\nREMOV ING “INABILITY  TO COMMUNICATE\\nIN ENGLISH” AS AN EDUCATION CATEGORY\\nThis final rule became effective April 27, 2020 and  eliminates the education categ ory “inability  to\\ncommunicate in English” when SSA evaluates disability  claims for adults under titles  II and XVI\\nof the Social Security  Act. See 85 Fed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020).  The preamble explains that this\\neducation category is no longer a useful indicator of an individual’s educational attainment or of the\\nvocational impact of an individual’s education because of chang es in the national workforce since\\nadoption of the prior rule more than 40 years ago and that these revisions “will help us better assess\\nthe vocational impact of education in the disability determination process.”  Id.  This final rule\\namends the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964  – Your education as a vocational factor\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –  Medical-Vocational Guidelines      \\nSETTING THE MANNER FOR THE APPEARA NCE OF\\nPARTIES AND WITNESSES AT A HEARING\\nThis final rule became effective January  17, 2020 and sets the time, place, and manner of appearance\\nfor hearing s at the administrative law judge (ALJ) level of SSA’s administrative review process,\\nwith modifications. It states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will appear at a\\nhearing  before an ALJ and will set the time and place for the hearing  according ly. Parties to a\\nhearing  will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone. Under this final rule, SSA will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing  based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the\\nxxxiii\\nability  to opt out of appearing  by VTC at the AL J hearing s level. The F inal Rule ex plains:\\nFinally , we are revising  our rule to state that, at the ALJ hearing  level, if we need to\\nsend an  amended notice of hearing , or if we need to schedule a supplemental\\nhearing , we will send the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  at least\\n20 days before the date of the hearing . The date of hearing  indicated in the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  will be at least 75 day s from the\\ndate we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing , unless the claimant has waived his\\nor her rig ht to advance notice. \\nThis final rule modifies the following  regulatory  sections:\\n§§ 404.929, 416.1429 – Hearing  before an administrative law  judg e - general.\\n§§ 404.936, 416.1436 – Time and place for a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.938, 416.1438 – Notice of a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.950, 416.1450 – Presenting  evidence to a hearing  before an administrative law judge.\\n§§ 404.976, 416.1476  – Procedures before the Appeals Council on  review.\\nSee 84 F ed. Reg . 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019).  \\nREVISED MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EV ALUATING\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS\\nAs part of its ongoing review of the Listings, SSA developed these final rules, effective April 2,\\n2021, to revise the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments that are used to evaluate claims involving\\nmusculoskeletal disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act,\\nto update the medical criteri a and clarify  how it evaluates musculoskeletal disorders. SSA also\\nmakes a conforming  chang e to the endocrine disorders body  system to comport with the chang e it\\nproposed to 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m) to be consistent with these final rules.  The new functional\\ncriteria include:\\n1.A documented medical need for a walker, two canes, or two crutches or a wheeled and\\nseated mobility  device (WSMD) (such as a manual wheelchair) involving  the use of both\\nhands, or\\n2. An inability  to use one upper extremity  to independently  initiate, sustain, and complete\\nwork-related activities4F  5 involving  fine and gross movements, and a documente d\\nmedical need for a one-handed, hand-held assistive device that requires the use of your\\nother upper extremity  or a WSMD involving  the use of one hand (such as a powered\\nwheelchair), or\\n3. An inability  to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to\\nindependently  initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities5 involving  fine and\\ngross movements.\\nThese criteria represent the level of dysfunction for upper and lower extremities that would cause\\nxxxiv\\nan adult to be unable to work or a child to be unable to perform age-appropriate activities. Assistive\\ndevices are considered as part of the first and second functional criteria in the musculoskeletal\\ndisorders listing s. These final rules also:\\n•Eliminate the requirement that there must be a prescription for an assistive device;\\n•Differentiate between patholog ic fractures and fractures caused by a traumatic even t\\nbecause the medical treatment and recovery  expectations for fractures differs, depending\\non the underly ing cause;  \\n•Acknowledg e the rapid development of motor function during  the infant and toddler\\nstages by  adding  a child listing  for evaluating  musculoskeletal disorders of infants and\\ntoddlers, from birth to attainment of ag e 3, with developmental motor \\n•Revise the content and structure of the current listing s to incorporate the new functional\\ncriteria into each listing ;\\n•Add specific sections in the introductory  text to provide g uidance on each listing ;\\n•Emphasize the current policy  that a musculoskeletal disorder may meet or medicall y\\nequal one of these listing s regardless of whether the person was prescribed opioid\\nmedication, or whether the person was prescribed opioid medication and did not follow\\nthis prescribed treatment; and\\n•Make conforming  chang es to the relevant criteria in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and\\nimmune disorders body  systems since those body  systems use terminology from the\\ncurrent musculoskeletal disorders listing  that are revised in these final rules.\\nThese final rules amend 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 – Listing  of Impairments\\nMusculoskeletal Disorders and 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m), addressing  functional equivalence in\\nchildren.  See 85 Fed. Reg . 78164 (Dec 3, 2020). \\n2019 CHANGES IN TH E LAW \\n2019 RULING S: \\nIn 2019, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) published four Social Security  Rulings (SSR): \\nSSR 19-1p addressing  the effect of the Supreme Court decision in  Lucia v. SEC on cases pending\\nat the Appeals Council; SSR 19-2p, addressing  the evaluation of cases involving  obesity ; SSR 19-\\n3p, addressing  requesting  reconsideration and hearing  either by paper or electronically ; and SSR 19-\\n4p, evaluating  cases involvi ng primary  headache disorders.  Highlights of the 2019 ruling s are\\nbelow. \\nSSR 19-1p – EFFECT OF THE DECISION IN LUCIA V . SEC \\nON CASES PENDING AT THE APPEALS COUNCIL  \\nSSR 19-1p explains how SSA will adjudicate cases pending  at the Appeals Council (AC) in which\\nthe claimant has raised a timely  challeng e to the appointment of an administrative law judge (ALJ)\\nunder the Appointments Clause of the United States Const itution in light of the Supreme Court’s\\nxxxv\\ndecision in Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018).  As set forth in Policy Net EM-18003 REV 2 ,1 if\\na claimant or representative files a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e and timely  requests\\nAppeals Council review, the AC will consider the challeng e in the contex t of the facts of the case\\n(including , but not limited to, the date of the ALJ decision and the date the challeng e was raised)\\nin determining  whether there is a basis to g rant review.  \\nThe AC will determine whether granting  review is appropriate under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970 or\\n416.1470, or both, when considering  both the decision on the merits and any potentially  unresolved\\nAppointments Clause issues.  In those matters where a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e to an\\nALJ decision issued prior to J uly 16, 2018 is raised to the Appeals Council in a proper request for\\nreview, the AC will g rant review and issue a decision or order remand, as appropriate.2\\nSSR 19-2P –  EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING OBESITY\\nSSR 19-2p provides g uidance on how SSA establishes that a person has a medically  determinable\\nimpairment of obesity  and how SSA evaluates obesity  in disability  claims.  The new SSR reflects\\nthe chang es to the rules SSA has published, and advances in medical knowledg e, since publication\\nof SSR 02-1p, which is repealed.  SSR 19-2p is discussed in more detail in this publication, under\\n“Specific I mpairments.”  \\nSSR 19-3P –  REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OR HEARING\\nBY AN ADMINISTRATIV E LAW JUDGE\\nSSR 19-3p explains the two options available to claimants appealing  SSA determinations that they\\nare not disabled based on medical factors.  This SSR explains both the paper and electronic options\\nfor requesting  reconsideration or a hearing  by an ALJ, and the similarities and differences between\\nthese two options.  Until recent years, the only way for claimants to request an appeal was to use the\\npaper-based option, which consists of paper appeal forms.  SSA developed an electronic appeals\\nsystem, called iAppeals.  This SSR explains the differences between the paper and electronic appeal\\nprocedure s for filing  a request for reconsideration or a hearing .  A claimant may file a “written\\nrequest” for appeal using  either the paper-based appeals process or iAppeals.  With the iAppeals\\noption the claimant must submit all of the needed information at once.  It is therefore the equivalent\\nof a combined request  and disability  report.  As noted in the ruling , an iAppeals offers several\\nconvenient flex ibility  for claimants: \\n•letting  claimants leave questions blank if inapplicable; \\n•allowing  claimants to indicate that additional time is needed to collect specific evidence;\\nand\\n•enabling  claimants to partially  complete an electronic appeal application, save it, and\\nfinish it later.\\nAfter a claimant files an appeal, he or she can submit evidence by fax, by mail, or in-person at a\\n1 See https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/08062018021025PM( Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n2This ruling is not further discussed as the date to raise the issue to the Appe als Council has passed. \\nxxxvi\\nfield or hearing  office.  However, if using  the iAppeals option, the claimant has an option to upload\\nand simultaneously  submit evidence with the electronic appeal. \\nSSR 19-4P - EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING PRIMARY  HEADACHE DISORDERS\\nSSR 19-4p: Effective August 26, 2019, SSR 19-4p prov ides guidance on how to establish that a\\nperson has a medically  determinable impairment of a primary  headache disorder and how to evaluate\\nprimar y headache disorders in disability  claims.  The SSR evaluates claims involving  primary\\nheadache disorders in a question and answer format.  SSR 19-4p is discussed in more detail in this\\npublication, under “Specific I mpairments.”  \\n2018 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\n2018 RULING S:  \\nThe Social Security  Administration issued three new Social Security  Ruling s: SSR 18-01p  and\\nSSR 18-02p addressing  onset dates of disability  and SSR 18-3p , addressing  the failure to follow\\ntreatment.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 49613; 83 Fed. Reg. 49616; 83 Fed. Reg. 49621. SSR 18-01p  and\\n18-02p together rescind and replace SSR 83-20, pertaining  to the “Onse t of Disability ,” and\\nclarify  how SSA determines the established onset date (EOD) in disability  and blindness claims,\\nrespectively .  These two ruling s became applicable on October 2, 2018.  Highlights of the 2018\\nruling s, discussed in more detail in this publication, are below:  \\nSSR 18-01P – DETERMINING THE ESTABLISHED  ONSET DATE IN DISABILITY\\nCLAIMS  AND SSR 18-02P –  DETERMINING THE ONSET DATE\\n IN BLINDNESS CLAIMS\\nSSR 18-01p specifically  addresses how SSA determines the EOD in claims involving  “traumatic,\\nnontraumatic, and exacerbating and remitting  impairments . . . [as well as] special considerations\\nrelated to the EOD, such as work activity  and previously  adjudicated periods.”  It also clarifies that\\nan ALJ may, but is not required to, call upon a medical expert to assist with inferring  the claimant’s\\nEOD. SSR 18-02p addresses how SSA determines the EOD in statutory  blindness claims, with\\nspecific emphasis on the differences between disability  and blindness claims under the Act.\\nSSR 18-3P – FAILURE TO FOLLOW TREATMENT\\nSSR 18-3p, rescinds and replaces SSR 82–59, pertaining  to the “‘Failure to Follow Prescribed\\nTreatment,’‘ and provides guidance about how SSA applies its “failure to follow prescribed\\ntreatment policy  in disability  and blindness claims under Titles II and XVI” of the Act.  It applies\\nin all determinations and decisions made on or after October 29, 2018.\\nSSR 18-3p explains that SSA will only determine whether a claimant has failed to follow prescribed\\ntreatment when all three of the following  conditions ex ist:\\nxxxvii\\n•The individual would otherwise be entitled to benefits based on disability  or eligible for\\nblindness benefits under Titles I I or XVI  of the Act;\\n•[SSA has] evidence that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed treatment for\\nthe medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\"\n",

See 2024 WL 3291790\\n(S.S.A. June 6, 2024);  89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June 6, 2024). The ruling  explains how SSA evaluates\\npast relevant work (PRW ) at step four of the sequential evaluation process in establishing  disability\\nunder titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations.  See pages\\n42-43, 59-66 for arg uments based on SSR 24-2p.    \\nSSR 24-2p provides guidance on whether an individual retains the RFC to perform the demands of\\ntheir PRW  at step four, in a “question and answer” format that answers the following  questions:\\n1.How do we define past relevant work ( PRW ?\\nSSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that an individual has performed: (1) within the past five\\nyears; (2) that was substantial gainful activity  (“SGA”) as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1571\\n- 404.1575 and §§ 416.971-416.975; and (3) that lasted long enoug h for the individual to\\nlearn to do the work.  However, work that the individual started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days is not considered PRW  under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)-(ii) and\\n416.960(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\\n2.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work was performed within the past 5\\nyears?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured from the date\\nof the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  I n some situations, the relevant period\\nis measured from an earlier date. See SSR 18-1p: Titles II and XVI: Determining the\\nEstablished Onset Date (EOD)  in Disability Claims , which identifies the most common\\ntypes of disability  claims and some of the regulations that explain the non-medical\\nrequirements for those types of claims. See also POMS DI 25001.001 Medical and\\nVocational Quick Reference Guide. The ruling  includes a table that provides guidelines for\\ncommon scenarios.\\n3.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days?\\nSSR 24-2p provide s that work is not PRW  if an individual started and stopped it in fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days, defined as a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends,\\nstarting  from the first day of work .  SSA generally  does not consider the total number of\\nhours or days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or part-time. \\nThe 30 calendar days requirement is separate from the consideration of SGA or whether an\\nindividual worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days\\nmay count toward the time needed for an individual to learn to do the work. \\nxiv\\nMoreover, if an individual was self-employ ed or an independent contractor, SGA will\\nconsider whether the individual was engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days,\\neven if individual work assig nments or contr acts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.\\nExamples of different scenarios are provided in the ruling , including  in footnote 14, which\\nexplains PRW includes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or\\nmore because the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even thoug h each\\nindividual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. \\n4.How do we determine whether an individual performed work long enough to learn to do it?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that the individual gained sufficient\\njob experience to learn the techniques, acquire information, and develop the facility  needed\\nfor averag e performance in the job.  The length of time this would take depends  on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific vocational\\npreparation (SVP).\\n5.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW ?\\nThere are two methods used to determine whether an individual can perform his or her PRW  \\n– whether they can perform the work as “actually  performed or as generally  performed in\\nthe national economy.”  “As they actually  performed it” looks to whether the individual\\nretains the RFC to perform the particular functional demands peculiar to the work the\\nindividual did.  “As it is generally  performed in the national economy ” looks to whether the\\nindividual retains the capacity  to perform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily\\nrequired throug hout the national economy , based on descriptions of occupations from\\nreliable sources of job information or from a vocational specialist or vocational ex pert. \\n6.How do we determine whether an individual can perform their PRW  as they actually\\nperformed it?\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work are generally\\nsufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental demands of such work.   \\nHowever, if the individual cannot provide this information, with the individual’s permission,\\nSSA will attempt get it from their employ er or another person who knows about  the\\nindividual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the individual to\\ntell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless the job started and stopped\\nin fewer than 30 calendar day s), including :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the individual did\\nduring  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of their work.\\n7.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW  as it is generally performed\\nin the national economy?\\nxv\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform their PRW  as it is generall y performed\\nin the national economy , SSA considers whether the individual retains the capacity  to\\nperform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily  required throug hout the national\\neconomy .  SSA may rely on descriptions of occupations  from reliable sources of job\\ninformation to determine how occupations are generally  performed. A vocational specialist\\nor vocational expert may also provide information about how an occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform a job as actually  performed, an\\nindividual’s job may have involved functional demands that are different from those\\ngenerally  required for the occupation throug hout the national economy . If the individual\\ncannot meet the functional demands actually  required in the former job but can meet the\\nfunctional demands as generally  required throug hout the economy, we will find the\\nindividual able to perform PRW  and not disabled.\\n8.How do we obtain evidence concerning an individual’s work history?\\nAn individual is the primary  source for infor mation concerning  their work history , but we\\nconsider all available evidence and information. Statements by the individual about their past\\nwork are generally  sufficient for deter mining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. If the individual cannot give us all the information we need, we may\\ntry, with the individual’s permission, to get it from their employ er or another person who\\nknows about the individual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nWe will ask the individual to tell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless\\nthe job started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days). The individual must tell us the\\ndates they worked, the duties they performed, and any tools, machinery , and equipment they\\nused. We will need to know the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing\\nthe individual did during  the workday , as well as any  other phy sical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\n9.What information do we require when determining whether work is PRW  that an individual\\ncan perform?\\nThis may include detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental demands,\\nand other job requirements. Information concerning  dates work was performed, tools and\\nmachines used, the extent of supervision required, and a descrip tion of tasks and\\nresponsibilities, may be needed to determine whether the work is PRW  that the individual\\ncan perform. If more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, SSA will request\\nseparate descriptions of each job the individual performed during  the relevant period. SSA\\nwill g ive careful consideration to:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no long er be met\\nand the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those requirements;\\n•the individual’s RFC (20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 and 416.945 and SSR 96-8p Assessing\\nResidual Functional Capacity in Initial Claims );  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corroborative information from other sources on the\\nxvi\\nrequirements of the work as actually  performed by the individual or as generally\\nperformed in the economy .\\n10. What findings and rationale must our determination or decision include when we find an\\nindividual is able to perform PRW ?\\nA determination or decisio n that an individual is not disabled, based on their ability  to\\nperform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, must contain adequate rationale and finding s.\\nIn finding  that an individual has the capacity  to perform PRW , the determination or decision\\nmust:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the individual\\nactually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in the national\\neconomy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in\\nthe national economy .\\nSSR 24-1p - HOW WE APPLY  MEDICAL-V OCATIONAL PROFILES\\nEffective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  , How We Apply Medical-Voc ational Profiles,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63, Medical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an\\nAdjustment to Other Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48477 (June\\n6, 2024).  This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three medical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous\\nunskilled work profile;  (2) no work profile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing\\ndisability  under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations. \\n \\nThese three profiles repres ent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two profiles, the\\nlifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but only as it pertained to claimants with\\nvisual impairments.2  This profile was  incorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the\\nrequirements and is not limited to claimants with visual impairments.  The lifetime commitment \\nprofile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .       \\n2 SSR 85- 15 pr ovides that:\\na finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant’s\\nvocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education\\nor less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.\\nxvii\\nSSR   is set up in a “question and answer” format, and answers the following  questions:\\n1.When do we consider the medical-vocational profiles in the sequential evaluation process?\\nSSA will use SSR  on and after its applicable d ate in any case in which the agency makes\\na determination or decision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for\\nfurther administrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR , SSA will apply  this\\nruling  to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. An\\nindividual can only  be found disabled based on a medical-vocational profile if a finding  at\\nstep four has been made that they do not have or are unable to perform their PRW .  At step\\nfive, an adjudicator must consider whether a medical-vocational profile applies before using\\nthe medical-vocational g uidelines.\\n2.What are the requirements of the arduous unskilled work profile?\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is not working at SGA level (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 404.1572, 416.910 and\\n416.072); \\n•has a history of 35 years or more of arduous unskilled work (see 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1568 and 416.968); \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s) (see\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1522 and 416.922); and \\n•has no more than a marg inal education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564 and 416.964). \\n \\nSSR 24-1p notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types of jobs, and that generally\\nSSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade level or less is a marg inal education.\\nHowever, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not reflect their\\nactual educational abilities.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b). The ruling  also\\ncites to SSR 20-1p: Titles II and XVI: How We Determine an Individual’s Education\\nCategory , which is discussed, infra  at xxxi.  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is used for an individual whose work experience includes\\nvery short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work, as long as the individual did not acquire\\nany transferable skills from those periods of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968.\\nSSA considers occupations with specific vocational preparation (“SVP”) levels one and two\\nto be unskilled, three and four to be semi-skille d, and five or greater to be skilled.  See\\nPOMS DI 25015.015 Work Experience as a Vocational Factor , and DOT Appendix  C.  See\\nalso SSR 00-4p Use of Vocational Expert and Vocational Specialist Evidence , and Other\\nReliable Occupational Informati on in Disability  Decisions.  See pages 69, infra, for a\\ndiscussion of SVP levels. The ruling also cites to SSR 82-41: Work Skills and Their\\nTransferability as Intended by the Expanded Vocational Factors Regulations for additional\\ninformation about how SSA considers skills from past work under its rules.  See page 122,\\ninfra , for a discussion of SSR 82-41.  \\nxviii\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also used for an individual whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired is not readily\\ntransferable to lig hter work.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as physical work requir ing a high level of streng th or\\nendurance.  Arduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or exertional\\nlevel, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical demands that we would classify\\nas heavy  or very heavy  based on the individual’s description of their past work. See 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1567 and 416.967.  Work that SSA would not classify  as heavy  or very heavy\\nmay still be considered arduous if, for example, it demands a great deal of stamina or if it\\ninvolves activity  such as repetitive bending  and lifting at a very fast pace.  An adjudicator\\nmust evaluate the record to make the ultimate finding  as to whether an individual’s work\\nmeets this criterion.\\n3.What are the requirements of the no work profile, and do we consider an individual’s RFC\\nwhen determining whether an individual meets this profile?\\nThe no work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other work for an\\nindividual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964).\\n,\\nSSR 24-1p provides that SSA adjudicators do not need to assess or consider RFC when\\napply ing the no work profile.  The ruling  notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA\\nconsiders any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment(s) that meet s the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairment, citing  to SSR 03-3p: Policy Interpretation\\nRuling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and Blindness in Initial Claims for\\nIndividuals 65 or Older  and citing  to SSR 23-1p:  Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement\\nfor Disability , discussed infra at xx, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p states that “limited education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills, but not enoug h to allow an individual with these educational qualifications\\nto do most of the more complex  job duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.  Generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal education is a limited\\neducation.  However, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not\\nreflect their actual educational abilities. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b); see\\nalso SSR 20-01p, How We Determine An Individual’s Education Category , discussed infra\\nat xxxi. \\n4.What are the requirements of the lifetime commitment profile, and how does the lifetime\\ncommitment profile apply to an individual who has worked at multiple jobs or for multiple\\nemployers?\\nSSR 24-1p states that the lifetime commitment profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nxix\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older) ( see 20 C.F.R. §§ 1563\\nand 416.963); \\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level;\\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s). \\nFor purposes of the lifetime commitment profile, the individual’s 30 years o f work do not\\nhave to have been at only one job or for only one employ er.  The jobs must have been in one\\nfield of work, meaning  that the types of work the individual performed must have been very\\nsimilar to one another.  Use of this medical-vocational profile is appropriate even if the\\nindividual has work experience in a field(s) other than the one in which they have a 30-year\\nlifetime commitment, as long as the work experience in the other field(s) is not PRW  that\\nthe individual is still able to perform considering  their RF C.\\nSSR 23-1p - DURATION REQUIREMENT FOR DISABILITY\\nEffective November 7, 2023, Social Security  Ruling 23-1p, Duration Requirement for Disability ,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-52, regarding  the duration of the impairment. The ruling  explains how\\nthe duration requirement is measured and defined, how it affects the sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess, and how SSA makes a finding  about the expected duration of an impairment. It addresses\\nhow duration is considered in continuing  disability  review cases when the beneficiary  or recipient\\nhas a new, severe medically  determined physical or mental impairment. It explains what will happen\\nif SSA learns of a return to substantial gainful employ ment within 12 months of a claimant’s onset\\nof disability . See 2023 W L 8236247 (S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023). \\nSSR 23-1p is set up in “question and answer” format and answers the following  questions: \\n1.How does a claimant meet the duration requirement for disability ? \\n2.What is a medically  determinable impairment (MDI ) that “can be expected to result in\\ndeath”?  \\n3.What do we mean by  “12 continuous months” and how do we measure it in initial claims?\\n4.How does the duration requirement affect  the five-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess?  \\n5.How does the duration requiremen t affect the three-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess for Title XVI  claimants who have not y et attained 18 y ears of ag e? \\n6.How do we consider the duration requirement when the claimant has new, severe MDI (s)\\nin continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases?  \\n7.What if we find that the claimant meets the duration  requirement based on an expectation\\nof continued severity , but the claimant returned to SGA within 12 months?  \\nxx\\nSSR 22-1p AND SSR 22-2P ADDRESSING FRAUD AND \\nSIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS \\n(formerly SSR 16-1p and 16-2p) \\nEffective May 17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p addressing Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and rescinded and replaced SSR 16-2p, addressing  the\\nEvaluation of Claims Involving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-\\n2p. Each of these new ruling s chang e the evidentiary  standard from “preponderance of the evidence”\\nto “reason to believe” and provide that before SSA will disreg ard evidence under the Act at the\\nhearing s level of the administrative review process,  the individual’s objection to the disreg arding\\nof that evidence will be considered, among  other chang es more fully discussed in the arguments\\nregarding  the new ruling s, infra, at pag es 238-47. \\nSSA stated in issuing  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p that the agency expects that these revised\\nprocedures will allow implementation of relevant sections of the Social Security  Act in a manner\\nconsistent with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the\\nprocedures outlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. These challeng es were based on principles\\nof constitutional due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, as discussed in the detailed\\ndescriptions of these ruling s, infra  at pag es 238-47.\\nREGULATORY  CHANGE OF  THE DEFINITION OF PAST RELEV ANT WORK BY\\nREDUCING THE RELE VANT PERIOD FROM 15 Y EARS TO FIV E YEARS \\nThe SSA has issued a final rule effective June 8, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to the Disability\\nAdjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work, 89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024). \\nThe effective date was subsequently  deferred to June 22, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).  The rule revises the definition of past relevant work (PRW ) by reducing  the relevant work\\nperiod from the current 15 years to five years.  The rule notes that this often reduces the number of\\njobs in an individual’s work history  that SSA will consider at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess when determining  whether an individual can perform PRW .  On J une 25, 2024, SSA also\\nissued Emerg ency Messag e 24028, providing supplemental instructions for res judicata policy\\napplication, considering  the chang e to the regulatory  definition of past relevant work, discussed infra\\nat xxiii.\\nAt step five, this revision will also change the previous work experience that SSA will consider\\nunder the Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  Because a step four finding  can result in a denial but not\\nan allowance, SSA anticipates making  proportionally  fewer denial decisions at step four and\\nproportionally  more decisions at step five and expects that shifting  decisions from step four to step\\nfive with less past work considered will result in more allowance decisions. \\nThis final rule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability  review\\n(CDR) cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial disabil ity sequential\\nevaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no longer consider past work that started and\\nstoppe d in fewer than 30 calendar days to be PRW .  The rule also notes that in the Notice of\\nProposed Rule Making  (NPRM) for this rule, SSA proposed to remove a current sentence in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a) and 416.965(a) that explains the intent of the work experience rules is to\\nxxi\\n“ensure that remote work experience is not currently  applied” in order to reflect that the arduous\\nunskilled work profile and the lifetime commitment profile consider work history  for a period long er\\nthan the proposed five year relevant work period; the final rule notes this chang e was made in 88\\nFed. Reg . 83877 (Dec. 1, 2023).  \\nSSA makes these revisions in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and 416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years that was substantial\\ngainful activity  and that lasted long  enoug h for you to learn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We\\nwill not consi der work to be past relevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than\\n30 calendar day s (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consid er past relevant work and work experience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar\\ndays means a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day\\nof work.  When we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or day s worked during  that period, or whether the work\\nwas full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days requir ement is separate from the\\nconsideration of substantial gainful activity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn\\nhow to do the work, althoug h the work performed during  the 30 calenda r days may count\\ntoward the time needed for y ou to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar days requirement\\nalso applies if you were self-employ ed or an independent contractor; we will consider\\nwhether you were engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual\\nwork assig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a): \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 4 16.965(a) from the prior text, “If you\\nhave no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for brief periods of time during  the\\nfive-y ear period, we generally  consider that these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as,\\n“If you have no work experience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear period, we\\ngenerally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the justification for the rule is to\\nallow individuals to focus on the most current and relevant information about their past\\nwork, better reflect the current evidence base on chang es over time in worker skill decay  and\\njob responsi bilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service, and reduce the\\nburden on individuals. \\nNew  SSR 24-2p and Rescissions : Pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-2p - Titles\\nII and XVI: How We Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effective June 22, 2024, which rescinds SSR 86-\\n8, and rescinds and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose of SSR 24-2p is to explain\\nhow SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform\\nthe demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy  set forth in SSA’s\\nregulations so that those regulations will be consi stently applied. See SSR 24-2p –  How We\\nEvaluate Past Relevant Work, 2024 WL 3291790 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June\\n6, 2024), discussed at pag es xiv-xvii, supra . \\nxxii\\nNew  SSR 24-1p and Rescissions: Also pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-1p,\\nTitles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , effective June 22, 2024, which\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63 .  The purpose of SSR  24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the\\nthree medical-vocational profiles - (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2)  no work profile; and (3)\\nlifetime commitment profile. These profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them\\nwill be found to be unable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process\\nwithout reference to the medical-vocational guidelines. The ruling  describes the profiles as follows:\\n1.Arduous unskilled work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\n \\n2.No work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education.  \\n3.Lifetime commitment profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older);\\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s).\\nSSR 24-1p, Titles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Vocational Profiles , 2024 WL 3291789\\n(S.S.A.

See, Intermediate Improvement to the Disability Adjudication Process, Including\\nHow We Consider Past Work; Deferral of Effective Date , 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).\\nThe EM notes that the new PRW  rule provides a new and less restrictive definition of PRW ,\\nsee 20 C.F.R. § 404.1560(b)(1), and SSR 24-2p. The new definition is less restrictive in two\\nways:  (1) The relevant period conside rs 5 years rather than 15 years of past work, and (2)\\nWork that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2.Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe EM notes that administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided,\\nit does not need to be decided again.  Res judicata is applied at all levels of the adjudication\\nprocess to avoid deciding  an issue that has previously  been decided based on the same facts,\\nsame issues, same parties, and same adjudicative period and is applicable only with respect\\nto the period covered by the prior final determination or decision.  The end of this period will\\ngenerally  correspond to the date of the prior final determination or decision, except when the\\ndate the claimant last met the non-disability  requirements for entitlement expired prior to the\\ndate of the final determination or decision.\\n3. Policy\\nThe EM announ ces SSA will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously\\nadjudicated period when the prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found\\nthe individual could do:  \\n1) PRW at step four of the sequential evaluation process and the PRW  cited is not PRW\\nunder the PRW  rule; OR\\n2)Other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process , work experience was\\nmaterial to the decision, and the individual’s work experience is different under the PRW\\nrule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, SSA will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or\\ndismiss a request for hearing  on that claim.\\nThe EM provides procedures and g uidance for SSA staff in implementing  this policy .4\\n4Editor’s Note: In the limited circumstances where a case has received a final determination, and the new\\nPRW rules would have resulted in a favorable outcome, representatives may wish to consider filing a new\\napplication instead of additional appeals in light of EM- 24028.  In the new application, a claimant could\\npursue an alleged onset date that predates the prior denial without the restriction of res judicata.

The purpose of the new\\nruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional\\ncapacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy\\nset forth in SSA’s regulations  so that those regulations will be consistently  applied. Among  other\\nmatters, SSR 24-2p revises the definition of PRW  by reducing  the relevant work period from fifteen\\nyears to five years.

The purpose of SSR 24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles - arduous unskilled work, no work, and lifetime commitment. \\nThese profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe medical-vocational guidelines.

See SSR 23-1p  – Duration Requirement for Disability , 2023 WL 236247\\n(S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023).  The new ruling ’s purpose is to update and consolidate SSA policy  regarding\\nthe duration requirement for establishing  disability ; considering  that since SSR 82-52 was published,\\nSSA has “revised several rules and issued policy  guidance that leave the original ruling  misalig ned\\nwith current regulatory  authority  and policy  guidance.  For instance, we chang ed the sequential\\nevaluation process for widows and Title XVI children; established the process for evaluating\\nmedical impro vement in continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases; instituted multiple work\\nincentives for recipients of Title XVI payments; and extended the reentitlement period for Title II\\nclaims.” (footnotes omitted).  \\nxxx\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 16-1P – FRAUD AND SIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS\\nAND SSR 16-2P – THE EV ALUATION OF CLAIMS INV OLVING THE ISSUE OF\\nSIMILAR FAULT IN THE PROVIDING OF EV IDENCE  \\nEffective May  17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p pertaining  to Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and SSR 16-2p pertaining  to the Evaluation of Claims\\nInvolving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-2p.  See 2022 WL\\n2533116-17 (S.S.A. May 17, 2022). SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p were issued to revise procedures that\\nwill allow implementation of relevant sections of the Social Security  Act in a manner consistent with\\nthe decisions of courts which have considered successful legal challeng es under constitutional due\\nprocess and the Administrative Procedure Act to the procedures outlined in former SSR 16-1p and\\nSSR 16-2p. \\nRESCISSION OF ACQUIESCENCE RULING (AR) 90-2(2)\\nAcquiescence Ruling  (AR) 90-2(2): Ruppert  v.

Reg . 25507, at nt. 17 (April 11, 2024).\\n2020 – 2021 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\nSSR 20-1p - HOW WE DETERMINE AN INDIV IDUAL’S \\nEDUCATION CATEGORY\\nThe Eleventh Edition also includes SSR 20-01p addressing  How we Determine an Individual’s\\nEducation Category . The ruling  went into effect on April 27, 2020, the same day  new reg ulations\\nwere issued which removed “inability  to communicate in English” as an education categ ory. See 85\\nFed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020). Now SSA will have four education categ ories at step five of the\\nsequential evaluation process:\\n1)High school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nskills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level or above” which generally\\npermits performance of semi-skilled throug h skilled work.\\n2)Limited education – some reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills abilities acquired\\nthroug h a 7th – 11th grade education, but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job\\nduties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.”\\n3)Marginal education – reasoning,  arithmetic, and language skills abilities needed for\\nsimple, unskilled jobs, g enerally  a 6th grade education or less.\\n4)Illiteracy – defined as “an inability to read or write” even simple messag es like\\ninstructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can sign his or her name. Generally\\nxxxi\\nhas little or no formal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p also acknowledg es that other evidence may show a higher or lower level of education\\nthan formal schooling  level would suggest. Examples of the evidence used are “past work\\nexperien ce, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily  activities,\\nhobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and vocational training . Another factor that SSA\\nmay consider is an extensive history  of special education, which can show in a particular case that\\nthe individual’s educational abilities are lower than the grade completed.  This ruling  amends the\\nfollowing  regulations:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964 and 20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines\\nHEARINGS HELD BY  ADMINISTRATIV E APPEALS JUDGES\\nOF THE APPEALS COUNCIL\\n \\nUnder a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA revised its rules to clarify  when and how\\nadministrative appeals judges (AAJ) on the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisions.\\nSee Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 F ed. Reg . 73138\\n(Nov. 16, 2020). Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the authority  to hold hearing s\\nand issue decisions under the existing  statute and regulations, but SSA had not exercised this\\nauthor ity or explained the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals\\nCouncil to assume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\nThe clarifications made by the rule ensure the Appeals Council is not limited in the type of claims\\nfor which it may hold hearing s. The stated goal of the rule is to increase adjudicative capacity  when\\nneeded, allowing  quicker adjustment to fluctuating  short-term workloads, such as when an influx\\nof cases reaches the hearing s level. The final rule amends or revises the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Rem oval of a hearing request(s) to the Appeals\\nCouncil)  provides that the “Appea ls Council may assume responsibility  for a hearing\\nrequest(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the administrative review process” and requires\\nsending  a “notice to all parties that the Appeals Council has assumed responsibility  for the\\ncase(s).” The Appeals Council is required to conduct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, applicab le to SSDI  claims and 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461, applicable to SSI claims.  Appeals Council review may be requested by any party\\ndissatisfied with the hearing  decision or with the dismissal of a hearing  request, following\\nthe procedures in §§ 404.967 throug h 404.982 for SSDI  claims and §§ 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461 for SSI claims.  The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judge who conducted\\na hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismissed a hearing  request will not participate in\\nany action associated with the request for Appeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.983, 416.1483 (Case remanded by a Federal court)  provides that when\\na Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, one option\\nlisted in the regulations is for the Appeals Council to schedule a hearing. The Appeals\\nCouncil may  take any  of these actions: \\nxxxii\\n•make a decision either without a hearing ; \\n•make a decision with a hearing ; \\n•dismiss the proceeding s, ex cept in limited circumstances; or \\n•remand the case to an ALJ “with instructions to take action and issue a decision or\\nreturn the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision.\\n If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility  for issuing  a decision and “a hearing  is\\nnecessary  to complete adjudication of the claim(s), an administrative appeals judge will hold\\na hearing  using  the procedures set forth in §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, as applicable.”  See\\n20 C.F .R.§§ 416.1429 throug h 416.1461, for the reg ulations applicable to SSI  claims. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.984, 416.1484 (Appeals Council review  of hearing decision in a case\\nremanded by a Federal court)  provi des that the decision of the ALJ or administrative\\nappeals judge will become the final decision of the Commissioner after remand unless the\\nAppeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case based on written exceptions to the decision\\nfiled with the Appeals Council or based on its authority  to hold a hearing . If no ex ceptions\\nare filed and the Appeals Counc il does not assume jurisdiction, the decision of the\\nadministrative law judg e or administrative appeals judg e becomes the final decision of the\\nCommissioner after remand. \\nREMOV ING “INABILITY  TO COMMUNICATE\\nIN ENGLISH” AS AN EDUCATION CATEGORY\\nThis final rule became effective April 27, 2020 and  eliminates the education categ ory “inability  to\\ncommunicate in English” when SSA evaluates disability  claims for adults under titles  II and XVI\\nof the Social Security  Act. See 85 Fed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020).  The preamble explains that this\\neducation category is no longer a useful indicator of an individual’s educational attainment or of the\\nvocational impact of an individual’s education because of chang es in the national workforce since\\nadoption of the prior rule more than 40 years ago and that these revisions “will help us better assess\\nthe vocational impact of education in the disability determination process.”  Id.  This final rule\\namends the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964  – Your education as a vocational factor\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –  Medical-Vocational Guidelines      \\nSETTING THE MANNER FOR THE APPEARA NCE OF\\nPARTIES AND WITNESSES AT A HEARING\\nThis final rule became effective January  17, 2020 and sets the time, place, and manner of appearance\\nfor hearing s at the administrative law judge (ALJ) level of SSA’s administrative review process,\\nwith modifications. It states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will appear at a\\nhearing  before an ALJ and will set the time and place for the hearing  according ly. Parties to a\\nhearing  will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone. Under this final rule, SSA will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing  based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the\\nxxxiii\\nability  to opt out of appearing  by VTC at the AL J hearing s level. The F inal Rule ex plains:\\nFinally , we are revising  our rule to state that, at the ALJ hearing  level, if we need to\\nsend an  amended notice of hearing , or if we need to schedule a supplemental\\nhearing , we will send the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  at least\\n20 days before the date of the hearing . The date of hearing  indicated in the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  will be at least 75 day s from the\\ndate we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing , unless the claimant has waived his\\nor her rig ht to advance notice. \\nThis final rule modifies the following  regulatory  sections:\\n§§ 404.929, 416.1429 – Hearing  before an administrative law  judg e - general.\\n§§ 404.936, 416.1436 – Time and place for a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.938, 416.1438 – Notice of a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.950, 416.1450 – Presenting  evidence to a hearing  before an administrative law judge.\\n§§ 404.976, 416.1476  – Procedures before the Appeals Council on  review.\\nSee 84 F ed. Reg . 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019).  \\nREVISED MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EV ALUATING\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS\\nAs part of its ongoing review of the Listings, SSA developed these final rules, effective April 2,\\n2021, to revise the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments that are used to evaluate claims involving\\nmusculoskeletal disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act,\\nto update the medical criteri a and clarify  how it evaluates musculoskeletal disorders. SSA also\\nmakes a conforming  chang e to the endocrine disorders body  system to comport with the chang e it\\nproposed to 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m) to be consistent with these final rules.  The new functional\\ncriteria include:\\n1.A documented medical need for a walker, two canes, or two crutches or a wheeled and\\nseated mobility  device (WSMD) (such as a manual wheelchair) involving  the use of both\\nhands, or\\n2. An inability  to use one upper extremity  to independently  initiate, sustain, and complete\\nwork-related activities4F  5 involving  fine and gross movements, and a documente d\\nmedical need for a one-handed, hand-held assistive device that requires the use of your\\nother upper extremity  or a WSMD involving  the use of one hand (such as a powered\\nwheelchair), or\\n3. An inability  to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to\\nindependently  initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities5 involving  fine and\\ngross movements.\\nThese criteria represent the level of dysfunction for upper and lower extremities that would cause\\nxxxiv\\nan adult to be unable to work or a child to be unable to perform age-appropriate activities. Assistive\\ndevices are considered as part of the first and second functional criteria in the musculoskeletal\\ndisorders listing s. These final rules also:\\n•Eliminate the requirement that there must be a prescription for an assistive device;\\n•Differentiate between patholog ic fractures and fractures caused by a traumatic even t\\nbecause the medical treatment and recovery  expectations for fractures differs, depending\\non the underly ing cause;  \\n•Acknowledg e the rapid development of motor function during  the infant and toddler\\nstages by  adding  a child listing  for evaluating  musculoskeletal disorders of infants and\\ntoddlers, from birth to attainment of ag e 3, with developmental motor \\n•Revise the content and structure of the current listing s to incorporate the new functional\\ncriteria into each listing ;\\n•Add specific sections in the introductory  text to provide g uidance on each listing ;\\n•Emphasize the current policy  that a musculoskeletal disorder may meet or medicall y\\nequal one of these listing s regardless of whether the person was prescribed opioid\\nmedication, or whether the person was prescribed opioid medication and did not follow\\nthis prescribed treatment; and\\n•Make conforming  chang es to the relevant criteria in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and\\nimmune disorders body  systems since those body  systems use terminology from the\\ncurrent musculoskeletal disorders listing  that are revised in these final rules.\\nThese final rules amend 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 – Listing  of Impairments\\nMusculoskeletal Disorders and 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m), addressing  functional equivalence in\\nchildren.  See 85 Fed. Reg . 78164 (Dec 3, 2020). \\n2019 CHANGES IN TH E LAW \\n2019 RULING S: \\nIn 2019, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) published four Social Security  Rulings (SSR): \\nSSR 19-1p addressing  the effect of the Supreme Court decision in  Lucia v. SEC on cases pending\\nat the Appeals Council; SSR 19-2p, addressing  the evaluation of cases involving  obesity ; SSR 19-\\n3p, addressing  requesting  reconsideration and hearing  either by paper or electronically ; and SSR 19-\\n4p, evaluating  cases involvi ng primary  headache disorders.  Highlights of the 2019 ruling s are\\nbelow. \\nSSR 19-1p – EFFECT OF THE DECISION IN LUCIA V . SEC \\nON CASES PENDING AT THE APPEALS COUNCIL  \\nSSR 19-1p explains how SSA will adjudicate cases pending  at the Appeals Council (AC) in which\\nthe claimant has raised a timely  challeng e to the appointment of an administrative law judge (ALJ)\\nunder the Appointments Clause of the United States Const itution in light of the Supreme Court’s\\nxxxv\\ndecision in Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018).  As set forth in Policy Net EM-18003 REV 2 ,1 if\\na claimant or representative files a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e and timely  requests\\nAppeals Council review, the AC will consider the challeng e in the contex t of the facts of the case\\n(including , but not limited to, the date of the ALJ decision and the date the challeng e was raised)\\nin determining  whether there is a basis to g rant review.  \\nThe AC will determine whether granting  review is appropriate under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970 or\\n416.1470, or both, when considering  both the decision on the merits and any potentially  unresolved\\nAppointments Clause issues.  In those matters where a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e to an\\nALJ decision issued prior to J uly 16, 2018 is raised to the Appeals Council in a proper request for\\nreview, the AC will g rant review and issue a decision or order remand, as appropriate.2\\nSSR 19-2P –  EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING OBESITY\\nSSR 19-2p provides g uidance on how SSA establishes that a person has a medically  determinable\\nimpairment of obesity  and how SSA evaluates obesity  in disability  claims.  The new SSR reflects\\nthe chang es to the rules SSA has published, and advances in medical knowledg e, since publication\\nof SSR 02-1p, which is repealed.  SSR 19-2p is discussed in more detail in this publication, under\\n“Specific I mpairments.”  \\nSSR 19-3P –  REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OR HEARING\\nBY AN ADMINISTRATIV E LAW JUDGE\\nSSR 19-3p explains the two options available to claimants appealing  SSA determinations that they\\nare not disabled based on medical factors.  This SSR explains both the paper and electronic options\\nfor requesting  reconsideration or a hearing  by an ALJ, and the similarities and differences between\\nthese two options.  Until recent years, the only way for claimants to request an appeal was to use the\\npaper-based option, which consists of paper appeal forms.  SSA developed an electronic appeals\\nsystem, called iAppeals.  This SSR explains the differences between the paper and electronic appeal\\nprocedure s for filing  a request for reconsideration or a hearing .  A claimant may file a “written\\nrequest” for appeal using  either the paper-based appeals process or iAppeals.  With the iAppeals\\noption the claimant must submit all of the needed information at once.  It is therefore the equivalent\\nof a combined request  and disability  report.  As noted in the ruling , an iAppeals offers several\\nconvenient flex ibility  for claimants: \\n•letting  claimants leave questions blank if inapplicable; \\n•allowing  claimants to indicate that additional time is needed to collect specific evidence;\\nand\\n•enabling  claimants to partially  complete an electronic appeal application, save it, and\\nfinish it later.\\nAfter a claimant files an appeal, he or she can submit evidence by fax, by mail, or in-person at a\\n1 See https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/08062018021025PM( Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n2This ruling is not further discussed as the date to raise the issue to the Appe als Council has passed. \\nxxxvi\\nfield or hearing  office.  However, if using  the iAppeals option, the claimant has an option to upload\\nand simultaneously  submit evidence with the electronic appeal. \\nSSR 19-4P - EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING PRIMARY  HEADACHE DISORDERS\\nSSR 19-4p: Effective August 26, 2019, SSR 19-4p prov ides guidance on how to establish that a\\nperson has a medically  determinable impairment of a primary  headache disorder and how to evaluate\\nprimar y headache disorders in disability  claims.  The SSR evaluates claims involving  primary\\nheadache disorders in a question and answer format.  SSR 19-4p is discussed in more detail in this\\npublication, under “Specific I mpairments.”  \\n2018 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\n2018 RULING S:  \\nThe Social Security  Administration issued three new Social Security  Ruling s: SSR 18-01p  and\\nSSR 18-02p addressing  onset dates of disability  and SSR 18-3p , addressing  the failure to follow\\ntreatment.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 49613; 83 Fed. Reg. 49616; 83 Fed. Reg. 49621. SSR 18-01p  and\\n18-02p together rescind and replace SSR 83-20, pertaining  to the “Onse t of Disability ,” and\\nclarify  how SSA determines the established onset date (EOD) in disability  and blindness claims,\\nrespectively .  These two ruling s became applicable on October 2, 2018.  Highlights of the 2018\\nruling s, discussed in more detail in this publication, are below:  \\nSSR 18-01P – DETERMINING THE ESTABLISHED  ONSET DATE IN DISABILITY\\nCLAIMS  AND SSR 18-02P –  DETERMINING THE ONSET DATE\\n IN BLINDNESS CLAIMS\\nSSR 18-01p specifically  addresses how SSA determines the EOD in claims involving  “traumatic,\\nnontraumatic, and exacerbating and remitting  impairments . . . [as well as] special considerations\\nrelated to the EOD, such as work activity  and previously  adjudicated periods.”  It also clarifies that\\nan ALJ may, but is not required to, call upon a medical expert to assist with inferring  the claimant’s\\nEOD. SSR 18-02p addresses how SSA determines the EOD in statutory  blindness claims, with\\nspecific emphasis on the differences between disability  and blindness claims under the Act.\\nSSR 18-3P – FAILURE TO FOLLOW TREATMENT\\nSSR 18-3p, rescinds and replaces SSR 82–59, pertaining  to the “‘Failure to Follow Prescribed\\nTreatment,’‘ and provides guidance about how SSA applies its “failure to follow prescribed\\ntreatment policy  in disability  and blindness claims under Titles II and XVI” of the Act.  It applies\\nin all determinations and decisions made on or after October 29, 2018.\\nSSR 18-3p explains that SSA will only determine whether a claimant has failed to follow prescribed\\ntreatment when all three of the following  conditions ex ist:\\nxxxvii\\n•The individual would otherwise be entitled to benefits based on disability  or eligible for\\nblindness benefits under Titles I I or XVI  of the Act;\\n•[SSA has] evidence that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed treatment for\\nthe medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\"\n",

      "  \"context\": \"the medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\\n•[SSA has]  evidence that the individual did not follow the prescribed treatment.\\nIf all three of these conditions exist, then SSA will make a failure to follow prescribed treatment\\ndetermina tion by assessing  “whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would be expected to\\nrestore the individual’s ability  to engage in SGA . . . [and]  whether the individual has good cause\\nfor not following  the prescribed treatment.”  The ruling  sets forth some examples of acceptable good\\ncause reasons for not following  the prescribed treatment, including  religion, cost, incapacity ,\\nmedical disag reement among  the claimant’s treating  sources, intense fear of surg ery, prior history\\nof unsuccessful results, high risk of loss of life or limb, and risk of addiction to opioid medication.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 05-02 PERTAINING TO \\nUNSUCCESSFUL WORK ATTEMPTS\\nOn May 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 05-02  pertaining  to unsuccessful work attempts as it was\\n“obsolete.” See 83 F ed. Reg . 22308 (May  14, 2018). As SSA ex plained:\\nOn February  28, 2005, we published  SSR 05-02, which provides guidance about\\ndetermining  whether substantial work activity  that is discontinued or reduced below\\na specified level may be considered an unsuccessful work attempt (UW A) under the\\ndisability  provisions of the law. SSR 05-02 explains the policies and procedures for\\nevaluating a work effort of 3 months or less and work efforts between 3 and 6\\nmonths.\\nOn October 17, 2016, we published final rules, Unsuccessful Work Attempts and\\nExpedited Reinstatement Eligibility , in the Federal Register at 81 FR 71367. These\\nrules, among  other thing s, removed some of the requirements for evaluation of an\\nUWA that lasts between 3 and 6 months. Specifically , the rules removed the\\nadditional conditions that we used when we evaluated a work attempt in employ ment\\nor self-employ ment that lasted between 3 and 6 months and provided that we now\\nuse one standard for work attempts lasting  6 months or less.\\nDue to these final rules and the resulting  simplification of our policies, SSR 05-02\\nis no longer correct. The final rules at 20 C.F.R. 404.1574(d), 404.1575( d),\\n416.974(c), 416.975(d) (unsuccessful work attempts) were effective November 16,\\n2016 . Consequently , we are rescinding  SSR 05-02 as obsolete. Notice of this\\nrescission is published in accordance with 20 C.F .R. 402.35(b)(1).\\nxxxviii\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 96-3P PERTAINING TO SEV ERITY  AND SSR 96-4P \\nPERTAINING TO MEDICALLY  DETERMINABLE IMPAIRMENTS\\nOn June 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 96-3p  which addressed “Considering  Alleg ations of Pain and\\nOther Symptoms in Determining  Whether a Medically  Determinable Impairment is Sever e” and\\nSSR  96-4p which addressed “Symptoms, Medically  Deter minable Physical and Mental\\nImpairments, and Exertional and Nonex ertional Limitations. See 83 Fed. Reg. 27816 (June 14,\\n2018). SSA explained that these  two ruling s are “unnecessarily  duplicative of SSR 16-3p” which\\naddresses “Evaluation of Sy mptoms in Disability  Claims,” effective March 28, 2016. Id.\\nAs SSA explained, SSR 16-3p is a “more comprehensive statement of our policy  on symptoms,\\nexplains how we evaluate the extent to which alleg ed symptoms limit an adult’s ability  to perform\\nwork-related activities and a child’s ability  to function effectively  in an age-appropriate manner.”\\nId. SSR 96-3p  “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” as SSR 16-3p  “explains that we will consider\\nsymptoms and functional limitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the\\nobjective medical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinab le impairment]  or\\ncombination of impairments that meets our duration requirement.” Id.\\nSSR 96-4p also “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” because “[i]n SSR 16-3p, we clarified that an\\nindividual’s symptoms alone are not enough to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled based on alleg ed symptoms\\nalone.” Id.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 82-59 PERTAINING TO FAILURE \\nTO FOLLOW PRESCRIBED TREATMENT AND \\nSSR 83-20 PERTAINING TO ONSET OF DISABILITY\\nSSR 82-59 addressing  “Failure to follow prescribed treatment was rescinded on October 29, 2018;\\nSee 2018 WL 4945641 (Oct. 2, 2018). It was replaced with SSR 18-3p. SSR 83-20 addressing\\n“Onset of disability ” was rescinded on Octobe r 2, 2018; See 2018 WL 4945639 (Oct. 2, 2018). It\\nwas replaced with SSR 18-01p (Determining  the established onset date in disability  claims) and 18-\\n02p (Determining  the established onset date in blindness claims).\\n2017 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\nREGULATORY RE VISIONS:  \\nIn a significant chang e, SSA substantially  revised its regulations pertaining  to medical evidence,\\neffective March 27, 2017.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5844 (Jan. 18, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg 15132 (Mar.. 27,\\n2017); 83 F ed. Reg . 51836 (Oct. 15, 2018).  As noted in the summary  of the final rules:\\nThe revisions include redefining  several key terms related to evidence, revising  our\\nrules about acceptable medical sources (AMS), revising  how we consider and\\narticulate our consideration of medical opinions and prior administrative medical\\nxxxix\\nfinding s, revising  our rules about medical consultants  (MC) and psycholog ical\\nconsulta nts (PC), revising  our rules about treating  sources, and reorg anizing our\\nevidence reg ulations for ease of use.\\n82 Fed. Reg. at 5844. The new regulations are effective for claims filed on March 27, 2017 and\\nafter.  The regulations in effect on March 26, 2017 apply for claims filed before March 27, 2017. \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1527, 417.927 (2019).  \\nHighlights of the new reg ulations include:\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the medical opinions of a claimant’s\\ntreating  sources. I nstead, medical opinions and prior administrative medical finding s\\nwill be evaluated equally  for “persuasiveness” based most importantly  on\\n“consistency ” and “supportability .”\\n•Physicians Assistants (PAs) and Advance Practice Reg istered Nurses (APRNs) are\\nnow included in the list of Acceptable Medical Sources (AMSs). L icensed\\naudiolog ists and optometrists can also be AMSs for certain purposes within the\\nscopes of their practices.\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the disability  decisions of other\\ngovernmental ag encies, including  the VA, but instead will consider and evaluate the\\nmedical evidence that was submitted to that ag ency  in support of that decision.\\n•SSA has rescinded SSR 96-2p, 96-5p, 96-6p and 06-03p and issued SSR 17-2p\\naddressing  finding s of medical equivalence. The rescissions apply  to all pending\\nclaims, including  claims filed before the rescissions . See  HAL LEX I -5-3-30.33\\nThese chang es are addressed in this publication.  Unfortunately , many  of these chang es are not\\nclaimant friendly , were driven by  data analy tics desig ned to produce fewer remands, and will\\nrequire more work on y our part to win cases.\\n33 HALLEX I-5-3-30 Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence. This new provision\\nhas important agency guidance concerning when to apply the new rules, protective filing date, evaluating\\nmedical evidence and subs equent applications.\\nxl\\nABOUT TH E AUTH OR\\nSarah H. Bohr has specializ ed in Social Security  law for over 40 years and, for the past 20 years,\\nhas had an appellate practice, writing  Social Security  federal court briefs.  Sarah is most proud of\\nher successful argument before the Supreme Court 24 years ago, in Sims v. Apfel,  530 U.S. 103\\n(2000).  Winning  Sims  turned out to be instrumental to the success of her career, as it has allowed\\nher to approach each federal appeal as a puzzle and to figure out the best issues to raise. In her\\ndisting uished career, she has worked in all areas of the practice of Social Security  law, from\\nadministrative representation, district court appeals (including  class action litigation), circuit court\\nappeals, to successfully  litigating  before the Supreme Court. \\nSarah is very proud of successfully  litigating  three key published Social Security  cases over the past\\nfour y ears:\\n• Arakas v.

Admin ., 61 F .4th 341 (4th Cir. 2023)\\nSarah obtained her B.A. from the Colleg e of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio and law degree from the\\nAntioch School of Law (later becoming  the District of Columbia School of Law).  Sarah learned\\nSocial Security  law while working  for 21 years as a legal services attorney  at Jacksonville Area\\nLegal Aid, Inc. (JALA). While at JALA, she successfully  litigated three published Eleventh Circuit\\ncases which are still cited by courts in 2024:  Myers v. Sullivan, 916 F.2d 659 (11th Cir. 1990);\\nStratton v. Bowen , 827 F.2d 1447 (11th Cir. 1987); and Flynn v. Heckler , 768 F.2d 1273 (11th Cir.\\n1986).

The ALJ erred in apply ing res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously\\nadjudicated period since the prior final determination finding  claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, and found claimant could do past\\nrelevant work (PRW) at step four and the PRW  cited is not PRW  under SSR\\n24-2p.\\n____ 9.The ALJ erred in apply ing res judicata to bar readjudication of a previou sly\\nadjudicated period since the prior final determination finding  claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, and found claimant could do other\\nwork at step five, and the claimant’s work experience is different under the\\nPRW  rule addressed in SSR 24-2p.\\nG. COLLATERAL ESTOP PEL\\n____ 1.The ALJ failed to follow the collateral estoppel policy  in not adopting  the\\ndisability  finding  of the prior SSI  claim to the current SSDI  claim.\\n____ 2.The ALJ erred in not apply ing the collateral estoppel policy set forth in EM-\\n24033, as the claimant requested reopening  within one year of the denial of\\nthe prior claim and the request was pending  as of J uly 13, 2024.\\n30\\nH. THE RECORD\\n_____ 1.The ALJ committed  reversible error by relying on an internet study  [or\\nmedical treatise or other non-record evidence]  to support his/her finding s.\\n_____ 2.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the post-hearing evidence submitted by the\\nclaimant to the record and to consider this evidence in rendering  his/her\\ndecision. \\n_____ 3.The ALJ erred in not providing  a complete exhibit list with the decision as\\nrequired by HAL LEX I-2-1-20(B )(3) when the decision is less than fully\\nfavorable. \\nI. LATE F ILING  OF THE REQUEST F OR REVIEW\\n_____  1. The Appeals Council should find good cause, as defined in 20 C.F .R. §§\\n404.911, 416.1411 for the claimant’s late filing  of his/her Request for Review.\\n_____ 2.The claimant’s failure to timely  request review should be excused in light of\\nhis/her mental impairments as discussed in SSR 91-5p. \\nJ. HEARING S BEF ORE THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n    _____ 1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral\\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n_____ 2.The Appeals Council erred by failing to notify claimant and his/her\\nrepresentati ve that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\n_____ 3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n_____ 4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issued a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nK.   SUBMISSION OF  NEW EVIDENCE TO THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n____   1. The new evidence enclos ed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J. \\n31\\n____   2. Even thoug h the evidence is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***]  and there is good cause for the failure to submi t the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n____  3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable proba bility that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decision, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\n____ 4.The Appeals Council failed to proffer to claimant evidence receive d from  a\\nsource, other than the claimant or their representative, associ ated with the\\nclaim(s) file.\\n____  5. The Appeals Council failed to offer a supplemental hearing with proffered\\nevidence when the AC granted review and issued a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision.\\n____ 6.The Appeals Council failed to consider the claim ant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving additional evidence, because the AC did not associate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\n____  7.The Appeals Council  must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice.\\n____ 8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request for review because the\\nreview denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\n_____ 9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nL.  SUBSEQUENT AP PLICATIONS \\n____  1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new \\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\n____ 2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim. \\n32\\n____  3.Submission of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\nM. RIGHT TO HEARING  BEFORE NEW ALJ\\n____ 1.in accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\n____ 2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeals Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.940 and 416.1440.\\nN.  DUTY TO F OLLOW AP PEALS COUNCIL REMAND ORDERS\\n____ 1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nO. ALJ BIAS, P REJUDICE, OR F AILURE TO F OLLOW P ROCEDURES\\n ____ 1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council  should issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\n____ 2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidence by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\n____ 3.The langu age of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decision as a forum to criticiz e [agency , agency\\npolicy  or procedure, other governmental agencies, the court,  the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] . \\n____ 4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.\\nP.  REDETERMINATIONS DUE TO FRAUD OR SIMILAR F AULT \\n____  1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n____   2.The ALJ’s finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar fault\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence. \\n33\\n ____  3.The ALJ failed to apply  the applicable standard for excluding evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable grounds to suspect, that\\nthe person knew the evidence provid ed was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n____  4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding  was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.\\n____  5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason] into\\naccount in exclud ing evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided.  \\n____ 6.The ALJ failed to comply with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermination of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p.  \\n____ 7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n____ 8.The notice of determination or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficient because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencie s prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision.  \\n34\\nSAMPLE ARGUMENTS\\nI. SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION PRO CESS ISSUE S4\\n  A. STEP  1 - SUB STANTIAL GAINFUL  ACT IVITY (SG A) \\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with SSR 83-33 in finding  that the claimant’s\\nemploy ment constitutes SGA.\\nApplic able law: SSR 83-33 indicates that earning s representing  the value of\\nthe work performed must be identified before consulting  the earning s\\nguidelines.5 Work will be considered SGA if it meets any of three tests. Only\\nthe first test is used, however, where income  is less than the specified\\nsecondary  guidelines amount unless there is some indication that an\\nindividual whose earning s presumably  indicate no SGA is nevertheless\\nperforming  SGA. Id. In accordance with SSR 94-1c, illegal activity  may\\nconstitute SGA.6\\nSSR 83-33 provides that work will be considered SGA if it meets one of three\\ntests. The first  test for employ ment focuses on countable earning s. The second\\nand third tests look to the comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired\\npeople in similar businesses/occu pations and to the worth of the work activity .\\nId. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in accordance with SSR 83-33 and\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574, 416.974.\\n4 Unde r the sequential evaluation process, the first step is to determine whether the claimant is engaging in\\nsubstantial gainful activity.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( b). If so, the claim is denied. If not, the second st ep is to\\ndetermine whether the claimant has a severe impairment, i.e., an impairment which significantly limits ability\\nto do basic work activities.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( c).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If a severe impairment\\nis present, the third step is to determine whether it meets or equals a listed impairment.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( d).  If it does, a finding of disability is directed.  Id.  If not, the fourth step is to determine whether\\nthe claimant has an impairment which precludes the performance of past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( e).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If so, the fifth step is to determine whether the claimant’s\\nimpairments prevent the performance of any other work, considering residual functional capacity, age,\\neducation, and work experience.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( f).  These regulations pertain to Social Security\\ndisability insurance cases. Identical regulations pertain to SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920( b).\\n5 The tiered earnings format was discontinued beginning in 2001. Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted each\\nyear, can be f ound a t: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed  Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n6 SSR 94-1c adopts the Seventh Circuit’s opinion rendered in Dotson v. Shal ala, 1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) ,\\nand introduces the opinion with a summary of this decision. This summary explains that the court held: (1)\\nillegal activity can constitute SGA, after noting nothing in the Act or regulations requires SGA t o be lawful\\nor recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purpo ses of determining SGA ; (2)  the\\nclaimant’s uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery he performed to suppo rt his $200- $300 per day\\ndrug habit provided substantial evidence to suppor t the ALJ’s finding that the claimant was engaged in SGA;\\n(3) the cost of the narcotics need not be deducted from his income as an IRWE;  and (4) the claimant raised\\nno meritorious due pr ocess or equal protection arguments. Id.\\n35\\nSSR 83-33 explains these tests in great detail and states that the first test\\nfocuses on whether the individual’s “countable earning s,” which represent the\\nvalue of the work performed, exceed the applicable earning s guideline. Under\\nthe first test for SGA, an individual’s “countable earning s” are calculated by\\nsubtracting  from gross earnings the amount of any subsidiz ed earning s from\\nthe employ er and the amoun t of certain impairment-related work expenses\\npaid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable earning s are then\\ncompared to the applicable amount listed in the earning s guidelines.\\nEarning s are considered subsidiz ed when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services.7 The Ruling\\nindicates that usually  the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s servic es according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow , inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employ ee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does not fully earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-sponsored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nId. Sometimes, an employ er can provide an adequate explanation of how a\\nsubsidy  was calculated. If not, the agency must question the employ er in\\nregard to the need for the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her\\npay to those services.\\nIf averag e mont hly countable income exceeds the applicable primary\\nguideline amount, the employ ee is ordinarily  considered engaged in SGA. If\\nthe earning s average less than the secondary  guideline amount, the employ ee\",\n",

How does the removal of \\\"inability to communicate in English\\\" as an education category affect claimants?\\n19. What strategies can be employed when drafting arguments for the Appeals Council based on the new rulings?\\n20. How can the information in the 11th edition of \\\"Winning Appeals Council Arguments\\\" be utilized to improve the success rate of appeals?. Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: the medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\\n•[SSA has]  evidence that the individual did not follow the prescribed treatment.\\nIf all three of these conditions exist, then SSA will make a failure to follow prescribed treatment\\ndetermina tion by assessing  “whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would be expected to\\nrestore the individual’s ability  to engage in SGA . . . [and]  whether the individual has good cause\\nfor not following  the prescribed treatment.”  The ruling  sets forth some examples of acceptable good\\ncause reasons for not following  the prescribed treatment, including  religion, cost, incapacity ,\\nmedical disag reement among  the claimant’s treating  sources, intense fear of surg ery, prior history\\nof unsuccessful results, high risk of loss of life or limb, and risk of addiction to opioid medication.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 05-02 PERTAINING TO \\nUNSUCCESSFUL WORK ATTEMPTS\\nOn May 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 05-02  pertaining  to unsuccessful work attempts as it was\\n“obsolete.” See 83 F ed. Reg . 22308 (May  14, 2018). As SSA ex plained:\\nOn February  28, 2005, we published  SSR 05-02, which provides guidance about\\ndetermining  whether substantial work activity  that is discontinued or reduced below\\na specified level may be considered an unsuccessful work attempt (UW A) under the\\ndisability  provisions of the law. SSR 05-02 explains the policies and procedures for\\nevaluating a work effort of 3 months or less and work efforts between 3 and 6\\nmonths.\\nOn October 17, 2016, we published final rules, Unsuccessful Work Attempts and\\nExpedited Reinstatement Eligibility , in the Federal Register at 81 FR 71367. These\\nrules, among  other thing s, removed some of the requirements for evaluation of an\\nUWA that lasts between 3 and 6 months. Specifically , the rules removed the\\nadditional conditions that we used when we evaluated a work attempt in employ ment\\nor self-employ ment that lasted between 3 and 6 months and provided that we now\\nuse one standard for work attempts lasting  6 months or less.\\nDue to these final rules and the resulting  simplification of our policies, SSR 05-02\\nis no longer correct. The final rules at 20 C.F.R. 404.1574(d), 404.1575( d),\\n416.974(c), 416.975(d) (unsuccessful work attempts) were effective November 16,\\n2016 . Consequently , we are rescinding  SSR 05-02 as obsolete. Notice of this\\nrescission is published in accordance with 20 C.F .R. 402.35(b)(1).\\nxxxviii\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 96-3P PERTAINING TO SEV ERITY  AND SSR 96-4P \\nPERTAINING TO MEDICALLY  DETERMINABLE IMPAIRMENTS\\nOn June 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 96-3p  which addressed “Considering  Alleg ations of Pain and\\nOther Symptoms in Determining  Whether a Medically  Determinable Impairment is Sever e” and\\nSSR  96-4p which addressed “Symptoms, Medically  Deter minable Physical and Mental\\nImpairments, and Exertional and Nonex ertional Limitations. See 83 Fed. Reg. 27816 (June 14,\\n2018). SSA explained that these  two ruling s are “unnecessarily  duplicative of SSR 16-3p” which\\naddresses “Evaluation of Sy mptoms in Disability  Claims,” effective March 28, 2016. Id.\\nAs SSA explained, SSR 16-3p is a “more comprehensive statement of our policy  on symptoms,\\nexplains how we evaluate the extent to which alleg ed symptoms limit an adult’s ability  to perform\\nwork-related activities and a child’s ability  to function effectively  in an age-appropriate manner.”\\nId. SSR 96-3p  “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” as SSR 16-3p  “explains that we will consider\\nsymptoms and functional limitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the\\nobjective medical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinab le impairment]  or\\ncombination of impairments that meets our duration requirement.” Id.\\nSSR 96-4p also “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” because “[i]n SSR 16-3p, we clarified that an\\nindividual’s symptoms alone are not enough to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled based on alleg ed symptoms\\nalone.” Id.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 82-59 PERTAINING TO FAILURE \\nTO FOLLOW PRESCRIBED TREATMENT AND \\nSSR 83-20 PERTAINING TO ONSET OF DISABILITY\\nSSR 82-59 addressing  “Failure to follow prescribed treatment was rescinded on October 29, 2018;\\nSee 2018 WL 4945641 (Oct. 2, 2018). It was replaced with SSR 18-3p. SSR 83-20 addressing\\n“Onset of disability ” was rescinded on Octobe r 2, 2018; See 2018 WL 4945639 (Oct. 2, 2018). It\\nwas replaced with SSR 18-01p (Determining  the established onset date in disability  claims) and 18-\\n02p (Determining  the established onset date in blindness claims).\\n2017 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\nREGULATORY RE VISIONS:  \\nIn a significant chang e, SSA substantially  revised its regulations pertaining  to medical evidence,\\neffective March 27, 2017.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5844 (Jan. 18, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg 15132 (Mar.. 27,\\n2017); 83 F ed. Reg . 51836 (Oct. 15, 2018).  As noted in the summary  of the final rules:\\nThe revisions include redefining  several key terms related to evidence, revising  our\\nrules about acceptable medical sources (AMS), revising  how we consider and\\narticulate our consideration of medical opinions and prior administrative medical\\nxxxix\\nfinding s, revising  our rules about medical consultants  (MC) and psycholog ical\\nconsulta nts (PC), revising  our rules about treating  sources, and reorg anizing our\\nevidence reg ulations for ease of use.\\n82 Fed. Reg. at 5844. The new regulations are effective for claims filed on March 27, 2017 and\\nafter.  The regulations in effect on March 26, 2017 apply for claims filed before March 27, 2017. \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1527, 417.927 (2019).  \\nHighlights of the new reg ulations include:\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the medical opinions of a claimant’s\\ntreating  sources. I nstead, medical opinions and prior administrative medical finding s\\nwill be evaluated equally  for “persuasiveness” based most importantly  on\\n“consistency ” and “supportability .”\\n•Physicians Assistants (PAs) and Advance Practice Reg istered Nurses (APRNs) are\\nnow included in the list of Acceptable Medical Sources (AMSs). L icensed\\naudiolog ists and optometrists can also be AMSs for certain purposes within the\\nscopes of their practices.\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the disability  decisions of other\\ngovernmental ag encies, including  the VA, but instead will consider and evaluate the\\nmedical evidence that was submitted to that ag ency  in support of that decision.\\n•SSA has rescinded SSR 96-2p, 96-5p, 96-6p and 06-03p and issued SSR 17-2p\\naddressing  finding s of medical equivalence. The rescissions apply  to all pending\\nclaims, including  claims filed before the rescissions . See  HAL LEX I -5-3-30.33\\nThese chang es are addressed in this publication.  Unfortunately , many  of these chang es are not\\nclaimant friendly , were driven by  data analy tics desig ned to produce fewer remands, and will\\nrequire more work on y our part to win cases.\\n33 HALLEX I-5-3-30 Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence. This new provision\\nhas important agency guidance concerning when to apply the new rules, protective filing date, evaluating\\nmedical evidence and subs equent applications.\\nxl\\nABOUT TH E AUTH OR\\nSarah H. Bohr has specializ ed in Social Security  law for over 40 years and, for the past 20 years,\\nhas had an appellate practice, writing  Social Security  federal court briefs.  Sarah is most proud of\\nher successful argument before the Supreme Court 24 years ago, in Sims v. Apfel,  530 U.S. 103\\n(2000).  Winning  Sims  turned out to be instrumental to the success of her career, as it has allowed\\nher to approach each federal appeal as a puzzle and to figure out the best issues to raise.

COLLATERAL ESTOP PEL\\n____ 1.The ALJ failed to follow the collateral estoppel policy  in not adopting  the\\ndisability  finding  of the prior SSI  claim to the current SSDI  claim.\\n____ 2.The ALJ erred in not apply ing the collateral estoppel policy set forth in EM-\\n24033, as the claimant requested reopening  within one year of the denial of\\nthe prior claim and the request was pending  as of J uly 13, 2024.\\n30\\nH. THE RECORD\\n_____ 1.The ALJ committed  reversible error by relying on an internet study  [or\\nmedical treatise or other non-record evidence]  to support his/her finding s.\\n_____ 2.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the post-hearing evidence submitted by the\\nclaimant to the record and to consider this evidence in rendering  his/her\\ndecision. \\n_____ 3.The ALJ erred in not providing  a complete exhibit list with the decision as\\nrequired by HAL LEX I-2-1-20(B )(3) when the decision is less than fully\\nfavorable. \\nI. LATE F ILING  OF THE REQUEST F OR REVIEW\\n_____  1.

HEARING S BEF ORE THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n    _____ 1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral\\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n_____ 2.The Appeals Council erred by failing to notify claimant and his/her\\nrepresentati ve that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\n_____ 3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n_____ 4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issued a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nK.   SUBMISSION OF  NEW EVIDENCE TO THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n____   1. The new evidence enclos ed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J. \\n31\\n____   2. Even thoug h the evidence is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***]  and there is good cause for the failure to submi t the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n____  3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable proba bility that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decision, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\n____ 4.The Appeals Council failed to proffer to claimant evidence receive d from  a\\nsource, other than the claimant or their representative, associ ated with the\\nclaim(s) file.\\n____  5. The Appeals Council failed to offer a supplemental hearing with proffered\\nevidence when the AC granted review and issued a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision.\\n____ 6.The Appeals Council failed to consider the claim ant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving additional evidence, because the AC did not associate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\n____  7.The Appeals Council  must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice.\\n____ 8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request for review because the\\nreview denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\n_____ 9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nL.  SUBSEQUENT AP PLICATIONS \\n____  1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new \\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\n____ 2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim. \\n32\\n____  3.Submission of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\nM. RIGHT TO HEARING  BEFORE NEW ALJ\\n____ 1.in accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\n____ 2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeals Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.940 and 416.1440.\\nN.  DUTY TO F OLLOW AP PEALS COUNCIL REMAND ORDERS\\n____ 1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nO. ALJ BIAS, P REJUDICE, OR F AILURE TO F OLLOW P ROCEDURES\\n ____ 1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council  should issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\n____ 2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidence by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\n____ 3.The langu age of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decision as a forum to criticiz e [agency , agency\\npolicy  or procedure, other governmental agencies, the court,  the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] . \\n____ 4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.\\nP.  REDETERMINATIONS DUE TO FRAUD OR SIMILAR F AULT \\n____  1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n____   2.The ALJ’s finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar fault\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence. \\n33\\n ____  3.The ALJ failed to apply  the applicable standard for excluding evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable grounds to suspect, that\\nthe person knew the evidence provid ed was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n____  4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding  was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.\\n____  5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason] into\\naccount in exclud ing evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided.  \\n____ 6.The ALJ failed to comply with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermination of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p.  \\n____ 7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n____ 8.The notice of determination or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficient because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencie s prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision.  \\n34\\nSAMPLE ARGUMENTS\\nI. SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION PRO CESS ISSUE S4\\n  A. STEP  1 - SUB STANTIAL GAINFUL  ACT IVITY (SG A) \\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with SSR 83-33 in finding  that the claimant’s\\nemploy ment constitutes SGA.\\nApplic able law: SSR 83-33 indicates that earning s representing  the value of\\nthe work performed must be identified before consulting  the earning s\\nguidelines.5 Work will be considered SGA if it meets any of three tests. Only\\nthe first test is used, however, where income  is less than the specified\\nsecondary  guidelines amount unless there is some indication that an\\nindividual whose earning s presumably  indicate no SGA is nevertheless\\nperforming  SGA. Id. In accordance with SSR 94-1c, illegal activity  may\\nconstitute SGA.6\\nSSR 83-33 provides that work will be considered SGA if it meets one of three\\ntests. The first  test for employ ment focuses on countable earning s. The second\\nand third tests look to the comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired\\npeople in similar businesses/occu pations and to the worth of the work activity .\\nId. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in accordance with SSR 83-33 and\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574, 416.974.\\n4 Unde r the sequential evaluation process, the first step is to determine whether the claimant is engaging in\\nsubstantial gainful activity.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( b). If so, the claim is denied. If not, the second st ep is to\\ndetermine whether the claimant has a severe impairment, i.e., an impairment which significantly limits ability\\nto do basic work activities.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( c).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If a severe impairment\\nis present, the third step is to determine whether it meets or equals a listed impairment.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( d).  If it does, a finding of disability is directed.  Id.  If not, the fourth step is to determine whether\\nthe claimant has an impairment which precludes the performance of past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( e).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If so, the fifth step is to determine whether the claimant’s\\nimpairments prevent the performance of any other work, considering residual functional capacity, age,\\neducation, and work experience.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( f).  These regulations pertain to Social Security\\ndisability insurance cases. Identical regulations pertain to SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920( b).\\n5 The tiered earnings format was discontinued beginning in 2001. Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted each\\nyear, can be f ound a t: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed  Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n6 SSR 94-1c adopts the Seventh Circuit’s opinion rendered in Dotson v. Shal ala, 1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) ,\\nand introduces the opinion with a summary of this decision. This summary explains that the court held: (1)\\nillegal activity can constitute SGA, after noting nothing in the Act or regulations requires SGA t o be lawful\\nor recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purpo ses of determining SGA ; (2)  the\\nclaimant’s uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery he performed to suppo rt his $200- $300 per day\\ndrug habit provided substantial evidence to suppor t the ALJ’s finding that the claimant was engaged in SGA;\\n(3) the cost of the narcotics need not be deducted from his income as an IRWE;  and (4) the claimant raised\\nno meritorious due pr ocess or equal protection arguments. Id.\\n35\\nSSR 83-33 explains these tests in great detail and states that the first test\\nfocuses on whether the individual’s “countable earning s,” which represent the\\nvalue of the work performed, exceed the applicable earning s guideline. Under\\nthe first test for SGA, an individual’s “countable earning s” are calculated by\\nsubtracting  from gross earnings the amount of any subsidiz ed earning s from\\nthe employ er and the amoun t of certain impairment-related work expenses\\npaid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable earning s are then\\ncompared to the applicable amount listed in the earning s guidelines.\\nEarning s are considered subsidiz ed when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services.7 The Ruling\\nindicates that usually  the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s servic es according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow , inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employ ee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does not fully earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-sponsored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nId. Sometimes, an employ er can provide an adequate explanation of how a\\nsubsidy  was calculated. If not, the agency must question the employ er in\\nregard to the need for the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her\\npay to those services.\\nIf averag e mont hly countable income exceeds the applicable primary\\nguideline amount, the employ ee is ordinarily  considered engaged in SGA. If\\nthe earning s average less than the secondary  guideline amount, the employ ee\"\n",

If such evidence is present, development is necessary to determine whether\\none of the other two tests for SGA is met. Where earning s fall between or are\\nequal to the specified primary  and secondary  amounts, an adjudicator will\\ngenerally  turn to the other tests for SGA.\\nThe seco nd test asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to\\nthat of unimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar\\noccupations. Under the second test, the individual’s work activity  is analy zed\\nin relation to the time, energ y, skills, and responsibility  involved in its\\nperformance. The issue is whethe r the work performed “is essentially  the\\nsame in quality and quantity  as that done by unimpaired individuals engaged\\nin the same or similar occupations as their means of livelihood.” Where the\\ncorrect answer is unclear, the agency  must “contact the employ er, the U.S.\\nEmploy ment Service, or other informe d sources in the community  for\\ninformation as to the time, energy, duties, and responsibilities of unimpaired\\nworkers doing  the same or similar work.” Id.\\nThe third test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the individual’s\\nwork activity , with reference to the prevailing pay scales of the community , is\\nclearly  worth more than the other wise applicable primary  amount listed in the\\nearning s guidelines.8 Id.\\nSSR 83-33 discusses the need for detailed documentation under the second\\nand third tests. The Ruling  further provides that a reasonable explanation as to\\nwhy work is not substantial will preclude a finding  of SGA pursuant to these\\ntests. Reasonable doubts are normally  to be resolved in favor of the claimant.\\nFinally , the Ruling  explains that unsuccessful work attempts are not SGA.\\nFor both the second and third tests of SGA, the Ruling  states that\\ndocumentation should go beyond the employee’s description of his or her\\nwork and include “a detailed description of how the work is performed by\\nunimpaired persons in the community , including  their remuneration, hours,\\nduties, and responsibilities.” Id. Such information should be soug ht from a\\nlocal employ ment service or other authoritative source. Also, under the\\nsecond and third tests, a reasonable explanation as to why earning s are not\\nsubstantial prevents a finding  of SGA.\\nAccording  to SSR 83-33, a finding  of SGA is inappropriate if there is a\\nreasonable explanation of why an employ ee’s earning s are not substantia l. An\\nexample of a reasonable explanation would be the employ ee’s inability  to\\nperform the full responsibilities of the job due to reduced pace or hours. “It\\n8 The tiered earnings scheme, with primary and secondary guidelines amounts, was discontinued beg inning\\nin 2001.

Id.\\n2.The ALJ erroneous ly concluded that the claimant’s self-employ ment\\nconstitutes SGA as set forth in SSR 83-34.\\nApplicabl e law: SSR 83-34 provides that work will be considered SGA if it\\nmeets one of three tests. The first test for self-employ ment concerns whether\\nthe individual renders significant services to and receives a substantial income\\nfrom the business. The second and third tests look to the comparab ility of the\\nwork to that of unimpaired people in similar businesses/occupations and to the\\nworth of the work activity . Id. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in\\naccordance with the Ruling  and 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1575, 416.975.9\\nSSR 83-34 provides that work activity  must be in accordance with three tests\\nbefore it can be determined not to constitute SGA. However, if one test\\nindicates the work qualifies as SGA, the inquiry  ceases and the work activity\\nis deemed SGA without reg ard to the other tests.\\nThe first test focuses on whether the individual renders significant services to\\nand receives a substantial income from the business. To find SGA under the\\nfirst test, both conditions must be met: the provision of significant services to\\nand receipt of a substantial income from the business. According  to the\\nRuling , the services of someone engaged in a one-person business are\\nnecessarily  significant. The only question remaining  for such individuals\\nconcerns whether the income received is substantial. For businesses involving\\nthe services of two or more people, an “owner or partner will be found to be\\nrendering  significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total\\ntime required for management of the business, or renders manag ement\\nservices for more than 45 hours a mont h regardless of the total manag ement\\ntime required by the busine ss.” Id. A farm landlord performs significant\\nservices if he or she materially participates in crop or livestock production or\\nmanag ement. Material participation is explained in the regulations at 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1082.\\nAn individual receives “substantial income” if: (1) the amount of “countable\\nincome” derived from the business on averag e for the calendar year exceeds\\nthe applicable earning s guideline; (2) the livelihood derived from the business\\nis comparable to that during  his or her pre-disability  period; or (3) the\\nlivelihood derived is comparable to that of unimpaired people making  a living\\n9 See also SSR 12- 1p (evaluation of SGA f or blind se lf-employed claimants).\\n38\\nin the same or similar businesses. Countable income is determined by\\ncalculating  the income representing  the person’s own productivity , which is\\ndone throug h figuring net income and then deducting  the reasona ble value of\\nany significant amount of unpaid help furnished by others, impairment-related\\nwork expenses, unincurred business expenses paid for by others, and certain\\nsoil bank payments. The Ruling  discusses the determination of the value of\\nthese deductions. Id.\\nIf averag e monthly  countable income does not exceed the applicable guideline\\namount,10 the individual may still receive “substantial income” from the\\nbusiness under the second standard if he or she continues to receive a\\nlivelihood comparable to that received for a number of years before disability .\\nThis standard is applicable where the business formed “the sole means of\\nlivelihood” during  the earlier years. The Ruling  cautions, moreover, that\\n“chronic illness or other special circumstances existing  from some time prior\\nto the individual’s becoming  disabled may indicate that his or her financial\\nsituation in that period should not be considered an indication of the\\nindividual’s standard of livelihood .” If that is the case, the third test for\\nsubstantial income would be “more pertinent.”\\nThe last test for substantial income indicates SGA will be found where the\\ncommunity  standard of livelihood for similar businesses is met, without\\nregard to the individual’s pre-disability  circumstances. SSR 83- 34 recog nizes\\nthat in determining  the community  standard, unrepresentative individuals\\nmust be excluded—for example, individuals whose “chronic illness accounts\\nfor a low level of income.”\\nThe second and third tests are discussed together by the Ruling . These look to\\nthe comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired people in similar\\nbusinesses and to the worth of the work activity , respectively . The second test\\nfor SGA asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to that of\\nunimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar businesses.\\nUnder the second test for SGA, the individual’s  work activity  is assessed “in\\nterms of all relevant factors such as hours, skills, energ y output, efficiency,\\nduties, and responsibilities[ .]” SSR 83-34 provides that each factor must be\\ndescribed in detail by the adjudicator, showing  its contribution to the business.\\nIf this activity  is established by conclusive evidence to be comparable to that\\nof unimpaired people who: (1) reside in the same community ; (2) are engaged\\nin the same or similar businesses, with the type of self-employ ment being  the\\nsame; and (3) are so engaged as their means of livelihood, the individual may\\nbe considered to be performing  SGA. Inconclusive evidence, including\\ngeneral rather than specific descriptions of the relevant factors, “will result in\\na finding  that work performed is not SGA.” Doubts must be resolved in favor\\nof the claimant. Further, the comparison group must derive a standard of\\n10 Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted yearly at: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed May 1,\\n2024) .\\n39\\nliving  considered adequate for the community .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that it might be necessa ry to develop the record\\nwith more information about the claimant’s activ ities than he or she can\\nprovide. “Contact, therefore, should be made with people having firsthand\\nknowledg e of the impaired individual’s work situation obtained  through\\nactual participation or observation.”\\nThe third and final test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the\\nindividual’s work activity  is clearly  worth more than the otherwise applicable\\namount listed in the earning s guidelines. The work activity  must be\\nconsidered either in relation to its value to the business or to the salar y an\\nowner would pay  an employ ee for the work.\\n3.The ALJ did not properly  averag e the claimant’s earnings  as set forth in SSR\\n83-35 in finding  that s/he eng aged in SGA.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-35 describes when and how averag ing countable\\nearning s or incom e is done for SGA determination purposes. It explains\\naverag ing in initial disability  cases and in continuing  disability  cases, except\\nduring  the reentitlement period.\\nIn determining  whether an employ ee’s averag e monthly  earning s\\npresumptively  indicate SGA by exceedin g the Earning s Guidelines,11 some\\nmethod is necessary  in cases where earnings  vary significantly  over time or\\nthe guidelines earnings level chang es. SSR 83-35 explains that in such cases\\n“it will be necessary  to average separately  the distinct periods of work\\ninvolved when there is a regulatory change in the SGA earning s level or there\\nis a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or earning s.”\\nSSR 83-35 diffe rentiates between earning s varying “somewhat” over the\\nmonths at issue and earning s that reflect a “significant chang e.” It explains\\nthat earning s or work activities varying “somewhat” require averagi ng “over a\\nnumber of months” before comparison with the Earning s Guidelines.12\\nSSR 83-55 states that certain situations require averag ing of earning s over\\ndistinct periods. It will be necessary  to averag e separately  the distinc t periods\\nof work involved when there is either (1) a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearnings level; or (2) a significant chang e in work patterns or income. The\\nfirst circumstance is straig htforward and can be determined by reference to\\nthe guidelines table, with earning s averaged over each period for which a\\ndifferent SGA level applies. Concerning  the second circumstance, the Ruling\\nstates:\\n11 Presumptive SGA a mounts, upda ted yearly, found a t: \\nhttp://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/ COL A/sga.html (Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .  \\n12 The  Ruling does not define “somewhat.”\\n40\\nWhen there is significant chang e in work patterns or earning s during  the\\nperiod of work requiring  evaluation, earning s are not averag ed over the\\nentire period of work involved. When there is such a change, it would not\\nbe appropriate to averag e earning s over the entire period of work, since\\none period of work activity  may not be representative of the other period.\\nUnrepresentative periods of work involve separate and distinct work\\nefforts. When there is a significant chang e in work patterns or earning s,\\nthe earnin gs must be averag ed over each separate period of work involved\\nto determine if either effort was SGA.\\nThe implication of this Ruling  is that when there is no “separate and distinct\\nwork effort,” but rather the same job, earning s must be averaged over the\\nwhole relevant period.\\nSSR 83-55 explain s how averaging is applied to the income of self- employ ed\\nindividuals.  While similar in many  respects to the assessment of the earning s\\nof employ ed people, a determination of averag e monthly  income for self-\\nemploy ed individuals must “consider whether the period of time included in\\ndetermining  averag e monthly  ‘countable income’ is, in fact, representativ e of\\nthe individual’s financial situation during  the period involved in the SGA\\nissue.”  The Ruling explains that ordinarily  income is to be averag ed over the\\nentire period of work at issue, as with employ ees, except where there is an\\nSGA earning s level chang e or “a significant chang e in work patterns or\\nincome.” It is necessary  to averag e a self-employ ed “individual’s ‘countable\\nincome’ by figuring total ‘countable income’ over a representative period and\\ndividing  by the number of months in that period”- separately  averag ing\\ndistinct periods of work “when there is a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearning s level or there is a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or income.”\\nSSR 83-35 also provides that engagement in SGA may be attributed to the\\nentire period. The Ruling  notes that where averag ed earning s or income\\nindicates SGA, “an individual may for purposes of the disability\\ndetermination be considered to have engaged continuously  in SGA  during the\\nentire period being  averag ed.”\\nFinally , SSR 83-35 addresses situations where a claimant has either stopped\\nworking  or has only recently  begun a pattern of work. In cases where a\\nclaimant is no longer working, but previously  worked for a continuous period,\\nearnings are to be averag ed over the actual period of work involved. On the\\nother hand, where the person has been empl oyed only a short time, such as 3\\nor 4 weeks, an evaluat ion must be made based on “the individual’s expected\\nwork pattern and earning s. If work was going on at the time of last contact\\nwith the individual, evaluation should be made in anticipation of its\\ncontinuance without other interruptions, in the absence of evidence clearly\\nindicating  the contrary .” A revision may be warranted, howev er, if subsequent\\nevidence shows the anticipated level of earning s did not materializ e.  Id.\\nFor details, see POMS DI  10505.015, Averag ing Countable Earning s.\\n41\\n4.The ALJ erroneously  concluded that the claimant’s employ ment constitutes\\nSGA without properly  considering  work-related subsidies as set forth in SSR\\n83-33.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-33 provides that an individual’s “countable\\nearning s” are calculated by subtracting  from gross earning s the amount of any\\nsubsidiz ed earning s from the employ er and the amount of certain impairme nt-\\nrelated work expenses paid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable\\nearning s are then compared to the applicable presumptive amount.\\nEarning s are considered subsidized when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services. SSR. The Ruling\\nindicates that usually the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s services according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work. Id.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple  tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow, inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” Id. The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Id. Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does  not fully  earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-spon sored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nWhere an employ er cannot provide an adequate explanation of how a subsidy\\nwas calculated, the agency  must question the employer in regard to the need\\nfor the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her pay to those\\nservices.  Id.  For more details, see POMS DI 10505.010(A) Determining\\nCountable Earning s, Subsidies.\\n5.The AL J erred by  counting  earning s from an unsuccessful work attempt.\\nApplicable law: In accordance with the unsuccessful work attempt (UW A)\\nrule discussed in SSR 83-34 and SSR 83-35, work activity  does not\\n42\\ndemonstra te an ability  to engage in SGA if, after working  no more than six\\nmonths, the individual involuntarily  discontinues or reduces such work  below\\nthe SGA level for reasons relating  to his or her impairment. The rule applies\\nto both employ ees and self-employ ed individuals. Id. See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1574(c)(1), 416.974(c)(1).  The regulations define an UWA as work that\\na claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her\\nimpairments.  Id.  SSR 84-25 prov ides that the UWA must be preceded by a\\nperiod when the claimant is either not working or performing  work below the\\nSGA level. A claimant can have a series of UWAs: “each continuous\\nperilosingrated by significant breaks as described, may be an UWA as long as\\ncriteria as to duration and conditions of work are met. . . .”  \\nIf the work lasted less than six months, it is an UWA if the claimant stopped\\nor reduced work earning s below SGA level as a result of the impairment or\\nthe removal of “special conditions that took into account your impairment and\\npermitted you to work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1574(c)(3), 416.974(c)(3).  Work\\nthat lasted more than six months at the SGA level is not “an unsuccessful\\nwork attempt regardless of why it ended or was reduced below [SGA]  level.” \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574(c)(4), 416.974(c)(4).\\n6.Work performed for fewer than 30 calend ar days is not considered past\\nrelevant work, even if it was performed at the SGA level.  \\nUnder revised regulations, SSA will also no longer consider past work that\\nstarted and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days to be past relevant work. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.965(b)(1)(ii).  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) specifically  provides:\\n(ii) 30 calendar days . When we consider past relevant work and work\\nexperience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30\\nconsecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.\\nWhen we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do\\nnot consider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period,\\nor whether the work was full-time or part-time. The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\nactiv ity or whether you worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthoug h the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntowa rd the time needed for you to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contra ctor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSee also SSR 24-2p (also providing  that work is not PRW  if it the work\\nstarted and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar day s).  \\nSSR 24-2p explains that if a claimant was self-emp loyed or an independent\\ncontractor, SSA will consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type\\n43\\nof work for 30 calendar days even if individual work assignments or contracts\\neach lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are\\nprovided in SSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW\\nincludes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30\\ncalendar days or more because the individual did the same job for at least 30\\ncalendar days even thoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped\\nwithin a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. SSR 24-2p provides two\\nexamples interpreting  the 30 calendar day  requirement:\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW if it was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample 2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during the 5-year relevant work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ did not address  impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) as\\nrequired as set forth in SSRs 83-33 and 84-26.\\nApplicable law: SSR 84-26 explains in detail SSA policy  regarding  IRWE\\nfor people who meet the SSA definition of disability . Under certain\\ncircumstances, an individual’s expenses are deducted from his or her income\\nwhen determining  whether that income reflects SGA.\\nThe cost of certain items and services can be deducted from an impaired\\nperson’s earning s when determining  SGA . Generally , these must be items and\\nservices the person needs in order to work, althoug h they may simul taneously\\nbe required for normal daily  activiti es. SSR  84-26 specifies that where an\\nIRWE otherwise qualifies, it is irrelevant that the equipment or service “is\\nalso needed to enable the indivi dual to carry  out normal daily  functions[ .]”\\nThe entire amount of the expense is deductible, without any reduction.\\nAllowable amounts are subject to reasonable limits, and to qualify  the\\npayments for the items and services must have been made by the impaired\\nindividual.\\nSSR 84-26 discusses in detail qualify ing expenses in six major categ ories and\\nprovides multiple examples in relation thereto and explains what showing  of\\nnecessity , if any, is required for each categ ory. These six major categ ories are\\n44\\n(1) attendant care services; (2) medical devices; (3) prostheses; (4) other\\nequipment; (5) routine drugs and routine medical services; and (6) similar\\nitems and services. Multiple examples are set forth of services and equipment\\nthat are deductible in appropriate circumstances . No separate showing  of\\nnecessity  is requir ed with regard to prostheses, whereas medical devices\\nqualify  when they are primarily  used for a medical purpose and are not\\ngenerally  useful to healthy  individua ls. However, the needs met by attendant\\ncare services must be “essential” and the services shown necessary  to enable\\nthe person to work. Similarly , to qualify  as “other equipment” an item must be\\nneeded for performing  required job tasks, “or to move from home to mode of\\ntransportation, or to control the disabli ng condition at home or in the work\\nsetting  so as to be able to function in a work activity .” Routine drugs and\\nmedical services, as well as similar items and services, must also be necessary\\nfor enabling  the individual to work.\\nSSR 84-26 clarifies that the impaired individual must be the one who pays the\\ncost of the equipment or services. In other words, the expense “has not been,\\ncannot be, and will not be, reimbursed by any source for the expense.”\\nFurther, payment must be made in “cash,” which includes checks or other\\nforms of money  but not pay ment in-kind. Proof of pay ment must be provided.\\nSSR 84-26 also caution s that the deductible amount of IRWE “is subject to\\nreasonable limits”:\\nGenerally , the amount paid for medical services, medical device...,\\nprostheses, and similar medically -related items and services will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it is no more than the Medicare prevailing  charg e\\nestabl ished for the same item or service in the individual’s locale under\\nPart B of title XVIII of the Social Security  Act (Health Insurance for the\\nAged and Disabled).\\nPrevailing  charg e information is available from individual Medicare carriers\\nthroug h Social Security  district offices. If the amount paid for an item or\\nservice exceeds the Medicar e prevailing  charg e in the individual’s locale, an\\namount equal to the prevailing  charg e will be deducted from earni ngs.  If the\\nimpaired individual wishes  to establish the reasonableness of the amount paid,\\nhe or she may rebut the prevailing  charg e guidelines by demonst rating  that the\\namount paid is consistent with the standard or normal charg e for the same or\\nsimilar item or service in his or her community .  If the reported item or\\nservice is not listed in the Medicare guidelines, the amount paid will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it does not exceed the standard or normal charge for\\nthe same or similar item or service in the impaired individual’s community .\\nAdditionally , when IRWE deductions are taken, SGA is ordinar ily determined\\nby focusing on earnings rather than the value of services rendered.  The\\nRuling  notes that in cases involving  IRWE deductions, the SGA decision will\\ngeneral ly be based strictly  on the individual’s earning s rather than the value of\\nservices the individual rendered. There is an exception, howev er: “the\\n45\\nsituation in which a person is in a position to control or manipulate the\\namount of his or her earning s, e.g., the person is self-employ ed and the value\\nof services rendered is clearly  worth an amount  greater than the earning s\\nreceived.”\\nFinally , SSR 84-26 explains that the provision regarding  IRWE deductions\\ndoes not apply  to determinations of whether a month of “services” is\\ncharg eable for trial work period purp oses. “In other words, deductions will\\nnot be made to determine whether a person’s monthly  earning s can be reduced\\nto $75 or less.”  Id. \\nFor more details, see POMS DI 10520.001 Impairment-Related Work\\nExpenses (I RWE).\\n8.The ALJ erred by excluding the blind claimant’s income related to vending\\nmachine operation when determining  whether SGA was being  performed.\\nApplicable law: SSR 12-1p discusses the treatment of income that blind self-\\nemploy ed vendors receive under the Randolph-Sheppard Act (and similar\\nState programs) from vending  machines that are located on the same property ,\\nbut are not serviced, operated, or maintained by the blind vendor.13  This\\nincome is subtracted from the person’s income before the total is compared to\\nthe applicable guideline as it is not a measure of his or her own productivity . \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1584, 416.984.\\nB.

SSR 16-3p also clarifies that an\\nindividual’s  symptoms alone are not enoug h to establish the existence of a\\nphysical or mental impairment or disability , and that we will not find an\\nindividual disabled based on alleg ed sy mptoms alone.” Id.  \\nFor more detail, s ee POMS DI  24501.021: Evaluating  Symptoms.\\n2.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant’s condition was not present prior to\\nhis/her date last insured as s/he presented evidence bearing on his/her\\ncondition prior to the date last insured as required by  SSR 74-8c.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 74-8c adopts the district court’s opinion rendered in\\nDiaz v.

Dec.  15, 1972).14 The Ruling  introduces\\nthe opinion with a summary , stating  the claimant “failed to produce any\\nmedical evidence [bearing ] on his condition prior to September 30, 1962,\\nwhen he last met the insured status requirement[ .]”\\nThrough the adopted opinion, the Ruling  provides that a disability  claim may\\nreasonably  be denied where a claimant has failed to produce any medi cal\\nevidence (either in the form of medical testimony  or records) that bears on the\\nclaimant’s condition during the period at issue. Note: The court did not state\\nthat there must be evidence dating from prior to the date last insured, only that\\nevidence must bear upon the claimant’s condition during  this period.

The court noted there was only a statement from the claimant, made two years\\nprior to the alleged onset date, alleging he had been told that he had stomach and pancreatic conditions. Unde r\\nthese circumstances, the court held the SSA had reasonably found the evidence did not establish disability\\nduring the period at issue. The court observed that a claimant bears the burde n of establishing disability, and\\nthat evidence indicating an impairment either began or reach ed disabling severity after expiration of the\\nclaimant’s insured status cannot serve to establish disability. Id.\\n47\\nalso be borne in mind that expiration of insured status does not affect the\\nviability  of a concurrent SSI claim. However, evidence of an impairmen t that\\neither began or reached disabling  severity  after expiration of the claimant’s\\ninsured status cannot serve to establish disability .\\n3.The ALJ did not follow the “slig ht abnormality ” standard in finding  that the\\nclaimant’s *** [ state impairment]  is non-severe . \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s *** [state impairment]  is not severe is\\nnot supported by  the evidence of record and inconsistent with SSR 85-28.\\n5.The AL J’s finding  that the claimant did not have any  severe impairment is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law: The claimant must have a severe impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1522(a), 416.922(a) states that a non-severe impairment “is not severe if\\nit does not significantly  limit” a claimant’s physical or mental activity  to\\nperform basic work activities.  Basic work activities mean the “abilities and\\naptitudes necessary  to do most jobs.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1522(a), 416.922(a). \\nThese include physical functions, such as walking , standin g, sitting , lifting ,\\npushing, pulling , reaching , carry ing, or handling ; capacities for seeing ,\\nhearing , and speaking ; understanding , carry ing out, and remembering  simple\\ninstructions; use of judgment; respon ding appropriately  to supervision, co-\\nworkers, and usual work situations; and dealing  with changes in a routine\\nwork setting . Id.   \\nMost circuits have adopted a slight abnormality  standard for severity , holding\\nthat an impairment is not severe if it is only a slight abnormality  which has\\nsuch a minimal effect on the claimant that it would not be expected to\\ninterfere with his or her ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or\\nwork experience.

Id.\\n48\\n6.The ALJ did not comply with SSR 96-8p in not addressing  the effect of the\\nclaimant’s *** [ state impairment]  on his/her ability  to work.\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-8p requires considering  the impact of both severe\\nand non-severe impairments on the ability  to work: \\nIn assessing  RFC, the adjudicator must consider limitatio ns and\\nrestrictions imposed by all of an individual’s impairments, even those that\\nare not ‘severe.’ While a ‘not severe’ impairment(s) standing  alone may\\nnot significantly  limit an individual’s ability  to do basic work activit ies, –\\nmay--wh en considered with limitations or restrictions due to other\\nimpai rments--be critical to the outcome of a claim. For example, in\\ncombination with limitations imposed by an individual’s other\\nimpairments,  the limitations due to such a “not severe” impairment may\\nprevent an individual from performing  past relevant work or may narrow\\nthe rang e of other work that the individual may  still be able to do.\\n  C.

The Supreme Court has held that:\\n[f]or a claimant to qualify  for benefits by showing  that his unlisted\\nimpairment, or combination of impairments, is ‘equi valent’ to a listed\\nimpai rment, he must present medical finding s equal in severity  to all the\\ncriteria for the one most similar listed impairment.\\nSullivan v.

See also\\nPOMS DI 24508.010(F )(6) (“Impairment or Combination of Impairments\\nEqualing  a Listing  – Medical Equivalence”)\\n3.The ALJ erred in rejecting  the opinion of the medical expert (ME) that the\\nclaimant’s impairments were medically  equivalent to a listed impairment\\nwithout asking  the ME to identify  the medical evidence in the record that\\nsupports the ME’s opinion as required by  SSR 17-2p.\\nApplicable law. Social Security  Ruling 17-2p, effective March 27, 2017,\\napplies to all pending claims, not only to claims filed on and after March 27,\\n2017, and replaces SSR 96-6p. SSR 17-2p states that, while at the initial and\\nreconsideration levels medical equivalence is determined by medical and/or\\npsycholog ical consultants, at the hearing  level it is ALJs “and some attorney\\nadvisors” who determine medi cal equivalence. To assist in the evaluation,\\nadjudicators “may ” request and consider medical expert evidence.  Similarly ,\\nwhere the Appeals Council issues a decis ion, it “may  ask its medical support\\n50\\nstaff  to help decide whether an individual’s impairment(s) medically  equals a\\nlisting .”\\nSSR 17-2p prohibits an adjudicator from finding  that a claimant’s\\nimpairments are medically  equivalen t to a listed impairment unless a medical\\nconsultant, psycholog ical consultant, medical expert, or Appeal s Council\\nmedical support staff opines that the claimant’s impairments(s) medic ally\\nequal the listing .  However, under the Ruling , an ALJ or the Appeals Council\\nare not required to obtain an opinion from a medical expert about medical\\nequivalence if the ALJ or the Appeals Council believes that the evidence does\\nnot reasonably  support a medical equivalence finding.  Further, an ALJ may\\nnot rely on a medical expert’s conclusory  opinion that a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s ) medically  equal the listing , but “must ask the ME to identify\\nmedical evidence in the record that supports the ME’s” opinion that a listing\\nis medically  equaled.\\nIn addition, if an ALJ determin es that a claimant’s impairments medically\\nequal the listing , the ALJ “must articulate how the record establishes medical\\nequival ency using  one of the three methods specified in 20 C.F.R. 404.1526\\nand 416.926.”  If an ALJ finds that a claimant’s impairments do not medically\\nequal a listing , that finding  alone is generally  sufficient articul ation for the\\nfinding .\\nD. RESIDUAL  FUNCT IONAL  CAPACIT Y (“RFC”) (ST EPS 4\\nAND 5) \\n1.The AL J did not comply  with SSR 96-8p in assessing the claimant’s RF C.\\nApplicable law: The RFC assessment is to be based on all of the relevant\\nevidence of a claimant’s remaining  capacity  to do work despi te his/her\\nimpairments.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a), 416.945(a).

As set forth\\nin SSR 96-8p, describing  “Assessing  Residual Functional Capacity  in Initial\\nClaims:”\\nin order for an individual to do a full range of work at a given exertional\\nlevel, such as sedentary , the individ ual must be able to perform\\nsubst antially all of the exertional and nonex ertional functions required in\\nwork at that level.

(emphasis added) .  Determining  an individual’s “capacity  to do at least\\nunskilled work . . . requires careful consideration of the assessment of RFC.” \\nSSR 85-15.\\n51\\n2.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 96-8p in assessing  the claimant’s RFC\\nbecause the ALJ’s RFC assessment is conclusory  and does not contain any\\nrationale or reference to the supporting  evidence, as required by  SSR 96-8p.\\n \\n3.The ALJ erred by not focusing  on the claimant’s ability  to sustain work\\nactivities.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  96-8p requir es that the RFC\\nassessment “include a narrative discussion describing  how the evidence\\nsupports each conclusion, citing  specific medical  facts (e.g., laboratory\\nfinding s) and nonmedical evidence (e.g., daily  activities, observations).” This\\nRuling  further provides:\\nIn assessing  RFC, the adjudicator must discuss the individual’s ability  to\\nperform sustained work activities in an ordinary  work setting  on a regular\\nand continuing  basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an\\nequivalent work schedule), and descri be the maximum amount of each\\nwork-related activity  the individual can perform based on the evidence\\navailable in the case record.  The adjudicator must  also explain how any\\nmaterial inconsistencies or ambig uities in the evidence in the case record\\nwere considered and resolved.\\nId.  The ALJ is also required to include in his/her RFC assessment, “a\\ndiscussion of why reported symptom-related functional limitations and\\nrestrictions can or cannot reasonably  be accepted as consistent with the\\nmedical and other evidence.”  Id.\\n4.The ALJ’s RFC finding  did not comply  with SSR 96-8p in that s/he did not\\ninclude the required “function-by -function” assessment . \\nApplicable law: SSR 96-8p provides that the “RFC assessment is a function-\\nby-function assessment based upon all of the relevant evidence of an\\nindividual’s ability  to do work-related activities.” Further, RFC involves both\\nexertional and nonex ertional factors, with exertional capacity  involving  seven\\nstreng th demands: sitting , standing , walking , lifting , carry ing, pushing , and\\npulling . “Each function must be considered separately .”  Id.  “Only  after” the\\nfuncti on-by -function assessment is completed “may  RFC be expressed in\\nterms of the exertional levels  of work, sedentary , light, medium, heavy , and\\nvery heavy.”  Id.  “In assessing  RFC, the adjudicator must discuss the\\nindividual’s ability  to perform sustained work activities in an ordinary  work\\nsetting  on a regular and continuing  basis . . . .”  Id.

It is crucial to the\\ndetermination of disability  as it is used to determine whether a claimant can\\nperform his/her past relevant work and/or any other type of work in the\\nnational economy .  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e) and (f), 416.920(e) and (f). \\nIndeed, RF C is defined as follows:\\nResidual Functional Capacity .  A medical assessmen t of what an\\nindividua l can do in a work setting  in spite of the functional limitations\\nand environmental restrictions imposed by all of his or her medi cally\\ndeterminable impairment(s).  RFC is the max imum degree to which the\\nindividual retains the capacity  for sustained performance of the physical-\\nmental requirements of jobs.\\nSSR 83-10.  A consultative examination, by regulation, includes an\\nassessment of a claimant’s functioning .

A “regular and\\ncontinuing  basis” means 8 hours a day, for 5 days a week, or an equivalent\\nwork schedule.  Id.\\n53\\n  E.RFC - M ENTAL IMPAIRM ENTS\\n1.The ALJ did not properly  assess the claimant’s mental RFC as requi red by\\nmultiple Ruling s.\\n2.The ALJ erred by not providing  a rationale supporting  the finding  that the\\nclaimant’s mental impairments do not sig nificantly  limit basic work skills.\\n3.While the ALJ found that the claimant has a severe mental  impairment,\\nhis/her RFC assessment does not consider the impact of this impairme nt on\\nfunctional ability  as required by  SSR 96-8p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 96-8p states that in assessing  RFC, nonex ertional\\ncapacity , such as limitations resulting  from mental impairment, “must be\\nexpressed in terms of work-related functions. ” Regarding mental\\nimpairm ents, SSR 96-8p states that “[w]ork-related mental activities generally\\nrequired by competitive, remunerative work include the abilities to:\\nunderstand, carry out, and remember instructions; use judg ment in making\\nwork-related decisions; respond appropriately  to supervision, co-wor kers and\\nwork situations; and deal with chang es in a routine work setting .”  Id.  \\nIn assessing  a claimant’s mental RFC, the ALJ must make finding s regarding\\nthe claimant’s ability  to perform basic work-related activities, as discusse d in\\nSSR 85-15.  SSR 85-15 provides that:\\n[t]he basic mental demands of com petitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supervision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations ; and to deal with chang es in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial  loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experience will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nSSR 85-16 cautions that a conclusion an individ ual can perform SGA is “not\\nto be inferred merely  from the fact that the mental disorder is not of listing\\nseverity.”  Id.  Further, the Ruling  provides that determining  mental RFC\\ninvolves the consider ation of evidence including : (1) all relevant history ,\\nfinding s and observations from medical sources; (2) reports of daily  living\\nand work activities; (3) third-party  testimony  regarding  performance and\\nbehavior; and (4) reports from workshops, group homes, or similar entities. \\nId.\\nThe Commissioner’s Ruling s demonstrate the need for presen tation of a\\nspecific, valid rationale supporting  any finding  that an individual’s\\nnonex ertional limitations do not signific antly limit basic work skills.  In\\n54\\naccordance with SSR 83-14, in cases involving  a combination of exertional\\nand nonex ertional impa irments, “[t]he usual requirements apply  for a clear,\\npersuasive, orderly  rationale.  There must be finding s of fact and recitation  of\\nthe evidence which supports each finding .” Likewise, SSR 85-15\\n“emphasiz e[s] the importance of thoroughness in evaluation on an\\nindividualiz ed basis” where a mental impairment is present.\\n4.The ALJ’s RFC assessment is deficient  as a matter of law because instead of\\ndetermining  the claimant’s ability  to perform basic work-related activities, the\\nALJ cited to the four factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a\\nwhich are part of the psy chiatric review technique evaluation.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 96-8p provides that in assessing  a claimant’s RFC, the\\nALJ is required to make finding s regarding  whether the claimant can: (1)\\nunderstand, carry out, and remember simple instructions; (2) respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations; and (3)\\ndeal with chang es in a routine work setting .  The four factors set forth in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a are part of the Psychiatric Review Technique\\nevaluation and are not suffici ently detailed to constitute ultimate RFC\\nfinding s.  As set forth in SSR 96-8p:\\nThe psychiatric  review technique described in 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and\\n416.920a and summariz ed on the Psychiatric Review Technique Form\\n(PRTF ) requires adjudicators to assess an individual’s limitations and\\nrestrictions from a mental impairment(s) in categ ories identified in the\\n“parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria of the adult mental disorders\\nlisting s.  The adjudicator must remember that the limitations identified in\\nthe “parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria are not an RFC assessment\\nbut are used to rate the severity  of mental impai rment(s) at steps 2 and 3\\nof the sequential evaluation process.  The mental RFC assessment used at\\nsteps 4 and 5 of the sequential evaluation process requir es a more detailed\\nassessment by itemiz ing various functions contained in the broad\\ncateg ories found in parag raphs B and C of the adult mental disorder\\nlisting s in 12.00 of the Listing  of Impairments and summariz ed on the\\nPRTF.\\n5.The ALJ’s mental RFC assessment is deficient as a matter of law because\\nthe ALJ did not [account for/build upon]  the finding s made as part of the\\npsychiatric review technique evauation.\\n6. The ALJ failed to account for his/her PRTF findings in the RFC\\nassessment, such as a moderate limitation in interacting with others as the\\nALJ did not address interacti on with supervisors, co-workers and/or the\\npublic.\\nApplicable law:  As “[t]he mental RFC assessment used at steps  4 and 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process requires a more detailed assessment”\\nthan the Psychiatric Review Technique evaluation, SSR 96-8p, the ALJ\\n55\\ncannot overlook or fail to expand upon the finding s made as part of that\\nevaluation.

Even thoug h the weig ht lifted in a\\nparticular light job may be very  little, a job is in this categ ory when it\\nrequires a good deal of walking  or standing  – the primary  difference\\nbetween sedentary  and most lig ht jobs.\\n“Frequent” means occurring  from one-third to two-thirds of the time. \\nSince frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full rang e of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking , off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .

Further, SSR 96-8p provides that:\\nin order for an individual to do a full range of work at a given exertional\\nlevel, such as sedentary , the individual must be able to perform\\nsubstantially all of the exertional and nonex ertional functions required in\\nwork at that level.  Therefore, it is nece ssary to assess the individual’s\\ncapacity  to perform each of these functions in order to decide which\\nexertional level is appropriate and whether the individual is capable of\\ndoing  the full rang e of work contemplated by  the ex ertional level.\\nId. (Emphasis added).\\n11.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can perform the full range of medium\\nwork is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law :  Medium work is defined in SSR 83-10 as follows:\\nThe regulations define medium work as lifting  no more than 50 pounds at\\na time with freque nt lifting or carry ing of objects weighing up to 25\\npounds.  A full range of medium work requires standi ng or walking , off\\nand on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours in an 8-hour workday  in order\\nto meet the requirements of frequent lifting or carry ing objects weig hing\\nup to 25 pounds.  As in light work, sitting  may occur intermittently  during\\nthe remaining  time.  Use of the arms and hands is necessary  to grasp, hold,\\nand turn objects, as opposed to the finer activities in much sedentary work,\\nwhich require precision use of the fingers as well as use of the hands and\\narms.\\nThe considerable lifting  required for the full range of medium work\\nusually  requires frequent bending -stooping  (Stooping  is a type of bending\\nin which a person bends his or her body  downward and forw ard by\\nbend ing the spine at the waist.) Flexibility  of the knees as well as the torso\\nis important for this activity.  (Crouching  is bending  both the legs and\\nspine in order to bend the body downward and forward .)  However, there\\nare a relatively  few occupa tions in the national economy  which require\\nexertion in terms of weig hts that must be lifted at times (or involve\\n59\\nequivalent exertion in pushing  or pulling ), but are performed primarily  in\\na sitting  position, e.g., taxi driver, bus driver, and tank-truck driver\\n(semiskilled jobs).  In most medium jobs, being on one’s feet for most of\\nthe workday  is critical. Being able to do frequent lifting  or carry ing of\\nobjects weig hing up to 25 pounds is often more critical than being able to\\nlift up to 50 pounds at a time.\\n12.Given the evidence of record that the claimant uses a cane, the ALJ’s finding\\nthat s/he can perform the exertional demands of light work cannot be\\nsustained.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday . Indeed, according  to the Commissioner’s\\npolicies, light work entai ls “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the\\n“primary difference between sedentary and mos t light jobs.”  Social Security\\nRuling  83-10 (empha sis added).  In order to be able to frequently  lift or carry\\nobjects weig hing up to 10 pounds which is requi red to perform light work, an\\nindividual must be able to stand or walk, off and on, for approximately six\\nhours out of an 8-hour day :\\nSince  frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full range of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking, off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .

An individual who uses a cane for ambulation cannot perform the\\nstanding , walking , and lifting  entailed in the performance of lig ht work.\\nThe regulations specifically  recognize that the “requirement to use a hand-\\nheld assistive device may . . . impact on the individual’s functional capacity\\nby virtue of the fact that one or both upper extremities are not available for\\nsuch activities as lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pullin g.”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(J)(4).

While the use of such a device does not alway s impact\\nthe ability to perform sedentary  work in light of the “minimal lifting  and\\ncarry ing requirements of many sedentary  unskilled occupations,” this is not\\ntrue for light work, which entails frequent lifting  of up to 20 pounds.

STEP 4 - AB ILITY TO RETURN T O PAST  RELEVANT WORK\\n1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claiman t’s job as a *** is past relevant work is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  conside red past work performed more than five years\\nprior to the date of the decision [or date last insured] , in violation of 20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 416.960(b)(1)(i) and SSR 24-2p.\\nApplicable law.  The regulations define work experience as the skills and\\nabilities the claimant has acquired throug h prior work which shows the type of\\nwork you may be expected to do.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  The SSA\\nhas issued a final rule effective June 22, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to\\nthe Disability Adjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work,\\n89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024), 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5, 2024)\\n(deferring  effective date to J une 22, 2024).  \\nAmong  other provisions, the rule revises the definition of past relevant work\\nby reducing  the relevant work period from 15 years to five years.  This final\\nrule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability\\nreview cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial\\ndisability  sequential evaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no\\nlonger consider past work that started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar\\ndays to be past relevant work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii),\\n416.965(b)(1)(ii). \\nSSA makes these revisio ns in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and\\n416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years\\nthat was substantial gainful activity  and that lasted long enoug h for you to\\nlearn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We will not consider work to be past\\nrelevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar days\\n(see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consider past relevant work and work experience (see §\\n404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30 consecutive days,\\nincluding  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.  When we\\nconsider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period, or\\nwhether the work was full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\n61\\nactivity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthough the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntoward the time needed for you to learn to do the work. The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contractor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a) : \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. 404.1565(a), 416.965(a) from the prior\\ntext, “If you have no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for\\nbrief periods of time during  the five- year period, we generally  consider\\nthat these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as, “If you have no work\\nexperience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)( 1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear\\nperiod, we generally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the\\njustification for the rule is to allow individuals to focus on the most\\ncurrent and relevant information about their past work, better reflect the\\ncurrent evidence base on chang es over time in worke r skill decay  and job\\nresponsibilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service,\\nand reduce the burden on individuals. \\nPursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued SSR 24-2p,  Titles II and XVI: How\\nWe Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effec tive June 22, 2024, which rescinds\\nSSR 86-8, and rescinds  and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose\\nof the new ruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether  an individual\\nretai ns the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their\\npast relevant work and to explain the policy set forth in SSA’s regulations so\\nthat those regulations will be consistently  applied.   See SSR 24-2p, 2024 WL\\n3291790 (S.S.A. J une 6, 2024); 89 F ed. Reg . 48479 (J une 6, 2024).  \\nAccor ding to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured\\nfrom the date of the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  However, in\\nsome situations, the relevan t period is measured from an earlier date. This\\nruling  includes a table that provides g uidelines for common scenarios.  \\n3.The ALJ erred in failing  to comply  with SSR 24-2p, which applies to this\\ncase.\\nApplicable law .  SSA will apply  SSR 24-2p on and after its applicable date of\\nJune 22, 2024, in any case in which the agency  makes a determination or\\ndecision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for further\\nadministrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR 24-2p, SSA will\\napply  this ruling to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the\\ncourt’s remand.  \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant did not work\\nlong  enoug h to learn how to do the work.\\n62\\n5.The ALJ conceded in his/h er decision at step one of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess that the claimant was not engaged in substantial gainful activity , and\\ntherefore erred in finding  that the claimant can return to this work.\\n6.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant only did work\\nthat started and stopped in a period of fewer  than 30 calendar days during  the\\npast five-y ear period.\\nApplicable law .  SSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that was performed: \\n•within the past five y ears; \\n•was substantial g ainful activity  (SGA) and \\n•lasted long  enoug h for the individual to learn to do preform the work.  \\nSee 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)) and 416.960(b)(1)(i).  According  to SSR\\n24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that:\\nThe individual gained sufficient job experience to learn the techniques,\\nacquire information, and develop the facility  needed for averag e\\nperfo rmance in the job. The length of time this would take depends on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific\\nvocational preparation (SVP).\\nSSR 24-2p provides that work is not PRW  if it the work started and stopped in\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s, defined as:\\na period of 30 consecu tive days, including  weekends, starting  from the\\nfirst day of work. We generally  do not consider the total number of hours\\nor days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or\\npart-time. The 30 calendar days require ment is separate from the\\nconsideration of SGA or whether an individual worked long enoug h to\\nlearn  how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days may count toward\\nthe time needed for an individual to learn to do the work.\\n Moreover, if a claimant was self-employed or an independent contractor, SSA\\nwill consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type of work for 30\\ncalendar days even if individual work assig nments or contracts each lasted\\nfewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are provided in\\nSSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW  includes “gig\\necon omy” work such as an individual who completed 20 different shopping\\ntrips for a grocery delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or more\\nbecause the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even\\nthoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSSR 24-2p provides examples interpr eting the 30 calendar day requirement.  \\nThe ruling  lists the following  two ex amples:\\n63\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW  if it was perfor med at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample  2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year relevant  work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to her past relevant work as she\\nactually  performed it (or as genera lly performed) is not based on substantial\\nevidence.   \\nApplicable law:  There are two methods used to determine whether a\\nclaimant can perform his or her PRW  – whether the claima nt can perform the\\nwork as “actually  performed” or as “generally  performed in the national\\neconomy .”  SSR 24-2p states that “[a]s they actually performed the work”\\nlooks to whethe r the claimant retains the “RFC to perform the particular\\nfunctional demands peculiar to the work the individual did.” \\nIn evaluating  work as “generally  performed  in the national economy ,” SSA\\nlooks to whether the claimant “retains the capacity  to perform the\\noccupation’s functional deman ds as ordinarily  required throug hout the\\nnation al economy ,” based on descriptions of occupations from reliable\\nsources of job information to determine how occupati ons are generally\\nperformed. A vocational witness may also provide information about  how an\\noccupation is generally  perfor med in the national economy .  SSR 24-2p also\\nexplains:\\nIf the individual cannot meet the functional demands actually  requir ed in\\nthe former job but can meet the functional demands as generally  required\\nthroug hout the economy , we will find the individual able to perform PRW\\nand not disabled.\\nIn determining  whether a claimant can perfor m a job as “actually  performed,”\\nthe claimant’s job may have involved functional demands that are different\\nfrom those generally  required for the occupation throug hout the national\\neconomy .  If the claimant cannot meet the functional demands actually\\nrequired in the former job but can meet the functional demands as generally\\nrequired throug hout the economy , SSA will find the individual able to\\nperform PRW  and is not disabled.\\n64\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work\\nare generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. However, if individual cannot provide this\\ninformation,  with the individual’s permission, SSA will attempt to get it from\\ntheir employ er or another person who knows about the individual’s work,\\nsuch as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nSSA will ask the claimant to describe all of the work perfor med in the last 5\\nyears (unless the job started and stopped  in fewer than 30 calendar days),\\nincluding :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking, standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the\\nindividual did during  the workday , as well as any other physical or\\nmental demands of their work.\\n \\n8.While the ALJ summaril y concluded that the claimant can return to his/her\\npast relevant work, s/he provided no specific findings  or analy sis regarding\\nthe phy sical and mental demands of this work, as required by SSR 24-2p.\\n9.The ALJ did not fulfill his/her duty, under SSR 24-2p, to develop the record\\nregarding  the claimant’s past work.\\nApplicable law.  SSR 24-2p provides that statements by a claimant about past\\nwork is generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and\\nmental demands of such work.  However, if the claimant cannot provide this\\ninformation, with the claimant’s permission, SSA will attempt get it from\\nothers, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the claimant to\\ndescribe all of the work perfor med in the last 5 years (unless the job started\\nand stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days), including  the dates they worked,\\nthe duties they performed, any tools, machinery , and equipment they used and\\nthe amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carrying the individual\\ndid during  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\nSSR 24-2p provides that SSA determines whether an individual can perform\\ntheir past relevant work (PRW ) by considering whether the individual retains\\nthe RFC to meet the functional demands of any of their PRW , as they actual ly\\nperformed it, or as it is generally  performed in the national economy . This\\nRuling  explains the information SSA needs to make this determination:\\nTo determine whether an individual can perform PRW , we need\\ninformation about the physical and mental demands of PRW , particularly\\n65\\nas relevant to the individual’s RF C. This may  include:\\n \\n•detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental\\ndemands, and other job requirements; \\n•the dates work was performed; \\n•tools and machines used;\\n•the ex tent of supervision required, and\\n•a description of tasks and responsibilities.\\nIf more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, we will request\\nseparate descriptions of each  job the individual performed during  the relevant\\nperiod.\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, determination of the individual’s ability to do PRW\\nrequires careful consideration of:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no\\nlong er be met and the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those\\nrequirements;\\n•the individual’s RF C;  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corrob orative information from other\\nsources on the requirements of the work as actually  performed by the\\nindividual or as g enerally  performed in the economy .\\nThe ALJ’s decision that an individual is not disabled, based on the ability  to\\nperform PRW , must contain adequate rationale and finding s of fact. SSR 24-\\n2p provides:\\nA determination or decision that an individual is not disabled, based on\\ntheir ability  to perform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step\\nfour of the sequential evaluation process, must contain adequate rationale\\nand finding s.\\nSpecifically , in finding  that an individua l has the capacity  to perform PRW ,\\nthe determination or decision must:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\n66\\nperformed in the national economy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the\\nPRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .\\nUnder SSR 24-2p, the ALJ’s decision must contain adequate rationale and\\nfindings which “consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either\\nas the individual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .”  \\n10.The ALJ misclassified the streng th requirements of the claimant’s past\\nrelevant work by the lightest duties performed, when, in fact, it was actually  a\\ncomposite job which also entailed more strenuous duties.\\n   11.The ALJ erred in not recognizing that the claimant performed a  “composite\\njob” which entailed  the duties of two jobs as discussed in POMS DI\\n25005.020(B ) and thus committed legal error in finding  that s/he can return to\\nthe least strenuous of his/her past duties. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that, after comparing  the claimant’s\\nresidual functional capacity  with “the physical and mental demands of [his or\\nher] past relevant work,” if the claimant “can still do this kind of work,” the\\nclaimant is not disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(f), 416.920(f).  A composite\\njob in one which entails duties which are performed at different exertional\\nlevels.  \\nPOMS DI 25005.020 addresses past relevant work as performed by a claimant\\nand discusses composite jobs:\\nComposite jobs have significant elements of two or more occupations and\\nas such, have no counterpart in the DOT.\\n•The claimant’s PRW  may be a composite job if it takes multiple DOT\\noccupations to locate the main duties of the PRW  as described by the\\nclaimant.\\n•If you determine that PRW  was a composite job, you must explain\\nwhy.\\n•When comparing  the claimant’s RFC to a composite job as the\\nclaimant performed it, find the claimant capable of performing  the\\ncomposite job only  if he or she can perform all parts of the job.\\n•A composite job does not have a DOT counterpart, so do not evaluate\\nit at the part of step 4 considering  work “as generally  performed in the\\nnational economy .”\\n67\\n•At step 5 of sequential evaluatio n, a claimant may be able to use skills\\nhe or she gained from a skilled or semiski lled composite job to adjust\\nto other work. See Transferability  of Skills Assessment (TSA), DI\\n25015.017, for instructions on how to assess transferability  of skills.\\n12.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the impact of the claimant’s inability  to\\ntolerate stress on his/her abilit y to perform his/her past relevant highly\\nstressful work, as discussed in SSR 85-15 and SSR 24-2p. \\nApplicable law: SSR 24-2p provides that in determining  whether an\\nindivid ual is able to perform PRW , the ALJ may need to obtain detailed\\ninformation regarding  the work’s “mental demands, and other  job\\nrequirements” and the ALJ’s decision must consider the “mental demands of\\nthe PRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .”  \\nSSR 85-15 acknowledg es that “since mental illness is defined and\\ncharacteriz ed by maladaptive behavior, it is not unusual that the mentally\\nimpaired have difficulty  accomm odating to the demands of work and work-\\nlike setting s. Determining  whether these individuals will be able to adapt to\\nthe demands or “stress” of the workplace is often extremely  difficult.” The\\nruling  states it is “not intended to set out any presumptive limitations for\\ndisorders, but to emphasiz e the impor tance of thoroug hness in evaluation on\\nan individualiz ed basis.”  SSR 85-15 provides examples of how reactions to\\nthe demands of work stress can affect the ability  to perform PRW :\\nThe reaction to the demands of work (stress) is highly individualiz ed, and\\nmental  illness is characteriz ed by adverse responses to seeming ly trivial\\ncircumstances. The mentally  impaired may cease to functio n effectively\\nwhen facing  such demands as getting  to work regularly , having  their\\nperformance supervised, and remaining  in the workplace for a full day. A\\nperson may become panicked and develop palpitations, shortness of\\nbreath, or feel faint while riding  in an elevator; another may experie nce\\nterror and begin to hallucinate when approached by a strang er asking  a\\nquestion. Thus, the mentally  impaired may have difficulty  meetin g the\\nrequirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.\\nBecause response to the demands of work is highly individuali zed, the\\nskill level of a position is not necessarily  related to the difficulty  an\\nindividual will have in meeting  the demands of the job. A claimant’s\\ncondition may make performance of an unskilled job as difficult as an\\nobjectively  more demanding  job. For example, a busboy  need only  clear\\ndishes from tables. But an individual with a severe mental disorder may\\nfind unmanag eable the demands of making  sure that he removes all the\\ndishes, does not drop them, and gets the table  cleared promptly  for the\\nwaiter or waitress. Similarly , an individual who cannot tolerate being\\nsupervised may not be able to work even in the absence of close\\nsupervision; the knowledge  that one’s work is being  judg ed and evaluated,\\n68\\neven when the supervision is remote or indirect, can be intolerable for\\nsome mentally  impaired perso ns. Any impairment-related limitations\\ncreated by an individual’s response to demands of work, however, must be\\nreflected in the RF C assessment.\\nId. (emphasis in orig inal).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant has the RFC to perform  sedentary\\n[or light] work, his/her finding  that s/he is able to return to his/her past\\nrelevant work as a *** [state job], which is classified as light [or medium]\\nwork both as s/he performed it and as it was performed in the national\\neconomy , cannot be sustained.\\n14.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her  past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, conflicts with the AL J’s own RF C  finding s.\\n15.The ALJ erred in classify ing the claimant’s past releva nt work as a *** [state\\njob] as “light” [or “sedentary ”] work when it was, in fact, “medium” [or\\n“light” work] , both as he/she performed the work and as performed in the\\nnational economy  according  to the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-2p provi des that a claimant is considered “not\\ndisabled” who retains the RFC to perform either the actual functional\\ndemands and job duties of his/her particular past relevant job or the functional\\ndemands and job duties of the occupation as it is generally  required by\\nemploy ers throug hout the national economy .\\n16.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, directly  conflicts with the VE’s testimony , which the\\nALJ essentially  disreg arded in his/her decision.\\nH.STEP 5 - AB ILITY TO PERFORM OTHER WORK\\n1.As the claimant lacks any transferable skills, s/he cannot, in fact, perform\\nsemi-skilled work as a [ state job]  as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  Skills are acquired in a claimant’s past relevant work or in\\nrecent education that provides for direct entry into skilled work. SSR 00-4p. \\nThe Commissioner has specif ically determined that “unskilled work\\ncorresponds to an SVP of 1-2; semi-skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 3-\\n4; and skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 5-9 in the [Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles] ” and these “regulatory  definitions of skill levels are\\ncontrolling .” Id.\\nFurthermore, as set forth in Social Security  Ruing  83-10:\\nthe [ a]bility  to perform skilled or semiskilled work depends on the\\n69\\npresence of acquired skills which may  be transferred to such work from\\npast job ex perience above the unskilled level or the presence of recently\\ncompleted education which allows for direct entry  into skilled or\\nsemiskilled work . . . .\\nThis Ruling  further explains that in order to find that a claimant has\\ntransferable skills, the individual “must have performed work which is above\\nthe unskilled level of complex ity, must have identifiable skills, and must be\\nable to use these skills in specific skilled or semiskilled occupations within his\\nor her RF C.”\\nA claimant who cannot use his or her skills in other jobs  is considered to have\\nan unskilled work backg round.  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past\\nwork, we consider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them\\nin other skilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  And\\nif the claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n2.Since the ALJ determined that the claimant could perform semi-skilled work,\\nthe ALJ pursuant to SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14 must cite examples  of jobs\\nthat the claimant  could perform and the incidence of such jobs in the national\\neconomy .\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Ruling  83-11 provides that in those cases\\nwhere a claimant’s past relevant work included one or more skilled or semi-\\nskilled jobs and transferability of skills is material, the “finding  of fact\\nrequires identification of the work skills, examples of specific skilled or\\nsemiskilled occupations within the person’s RFC to which s/he or she can\\ntransfer skills (if any), and a statement of the incidence of such jobs in the\\nregion in which the person lives or in several regions of the country .”  Id.  The\\nALJ must ask the vocational witness to identify  examples of appropriate jobs\\nand to state the incidence of such  jobs in the national economy .  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1566, 416.966.  \\nSSR 83-14, applicable when a claimant has a combination of exertional and\\nnonex ertional impairments, provides that:\\n[w]henever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disabled, the determinatio n or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/job s the person can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.Since the testimony  of the VE supports a finding  that there is no work in the\\nnational economy  upon a proper consideration of all of the claimant’s\\nlimitations, the Appeals Council should award benefits.\\n70\\n4.The Appeals Council should find the claimant disabled based on the\\ntestimony  of the vocational ex pert.\\n5.The evidence of record documents that the claimant is disabled and unable to\\nperform the basic mental demands of unskilled work as described in SSR 85-\\n15, warranting  an award of benefits.\\nApplicable law : As set forth in SSR 85-15:\\nThe basic menta l demands of competitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry  out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supe rvision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations; and to deal with changes in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding  of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experien ce will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nExample 1:  A person whose vocational factors of age, education, and\\nwork experience would ordinarily  be considered favorable (i.e., very\\nyoung  age, unive rsity education, and highly skilled work experience)\\nwould have a severely limited occupational base if he or she has a mental\\nimpairment which causes a substantial loss of ability  to respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations.  A\\nfinding  of disability  would be appropriate.\\nSimilarly , SSR 96-9p states the following  regarding  the mental demands of\\nsedentary  work:\\nA substantial loss of ability  to meet any one of several basic work-related\\nactivities on a sustaine d basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or an\\nequivalent work schedule), will substantially  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and would justify a finding  of disability .  These mental\\nactiviti es are generally  required by competitive, remunerative, unskilled\\nwork:\\n•Understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n•Making  judgments that are commensurate with the functions of\\nunskilled work – i.e., simple work- related decisions.\\n•Responding  appropriately  to supervision, co-workers, and usual\\nwork situations.\\n•Dealing  with chang es in a routine work setting .\\nPOMS DI 25020.010, addressing  mental limitations, addresses “substantial\\n71\\nloss” as follows: \\n“Substantial loss” cannot be precisely  defined.  It does not necessarily\\nrelate to any particular adjective, number, or percent age.  In practical\\nterms, an individual has a substantial loss of ability  to perfo rm a basic\\nmental activity  when he or she cannot perform the particular activit y in\\nregular, competitive employ ment but, at best, could do so only in a\\nsheltered work setting  where special considerations and attentio n are\\nprovided. This requires professional judgment, on the basis of the\\nevidence in file in each case. The impairment in a claim of this type may\\nmeet or equal the listed medical criteria.  Therefore, before making  a\\ndetermination that includes vocational evaluation, the adjudicat or should\\ndiscuss the case with a psychiatrist or psycholog ist to learn whether a\\nsignificant part of the evidence had been previously  overlooked or\\nunderrated. . . .\\nEXCEP TION : In a few rare instances where a person’s vocatio nal\\nprofile is extrem ely adverse (e.g., closely  approaching  retiremen t age,\\nlimited education or less, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field\\nof unskilled  work that is now precluded by a mental impairment), a\\nfinding  of “disabled” may be appropri ate. (This would be adjudicated\\nunder the Lifetime Com mitments Special Medical-Vocational Profile. See\\nDI 25010.001B .3.).\\nId. (Emphasis in original).  See generally  the following  POMS addressing\\nmental impairments: DI 25015.020, 25020.001-25020.01 5, 25025.001, and\\n25025.030.\\n6.The ALJ erred in relying on the testimony  of a vocational expert which rebuts\\nthe finding  of disability directed by the Medical-Vocational Guidelines\\n(Grids).\\nApplicabl e law:  The Grids rules are conclusive and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted “rebuttable presumptions” of disability  that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10  directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was a\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational testimony  that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particula r individual’s\\nvocational factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disabled. However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\n72\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)). The Commissioner noted that since “there is\\nno provision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact\\nfor SSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations, “the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the direct ed conclusion of disability  was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.” Id.\\n7.The ALJ erred in relying on the VE’s testimony  that considered whether the\\nclaimant ’s need for [state limitation]  could be reasonably  accommodated by\\nemploy ers in deny ing this case.\\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court has held that the issue of reasonable\\naccommodation by employ ers is not relevant in a Social Security  case.

Under the second test, the individual’s work activity  is analy zed\\nin relation to the time, energ y, skills, and responsibility  involved in its\\nperformance. The issue is whethe r the work performed “is essentially  the\\nsame in quality and quantity  as that done by unimpaired individuals engaged\\nin the same or similar occupations as their means of livelihood.” Where the\\ncorrect answer is unclear, the agency  must “contact the employ er, the U.S.\\nEmploy ment Service, or other informe d sources in the community  for\\ninformation as to the time, energy, duties, and responsibilities of unimpaired\\nworkers doing  the same or similar work.” Id.\\nThe third test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the individual’s\\nwork activity , with reference to the prevailing pay scales of the community , is\\nclearly  worth more than the other wise applicable primary  amount listed in the\\nearning s guidelines.8 Id.\\nSSR 83-33 discusses the need for detailed documentation under the second\\nand third tests. The Ruling  further provides that a reasonable explanation as to\\nwhy work is not substantial will preclude a finding  of SGA pursuant to these\\ntests. Reasonable doubts are normally  to be resolved in favor of the claimant.\\nFinally , the Ruling  explains that unsuccessful work attempts are not SGA.\\nFor both the second and third tests of SGA, the Ruling  states that\\ndocumentation should go beyond the employee’s description of his or her\\nwork and include “a detailed description of how the work is performed by\\nunimpaired persons in the community , including  their remuneration, hours,\\nduties, and responsibilities.” Id. Such information should be soug ht from a\\nlocal employ ment service or other authoritative source. Also, under the\\nsecond and third tests, a reasonable explanation as to why earning s are not\\nsubstantial prevents a finding  of SGA.\\nAccording  to SSR 83-33, a finding  of SGA is inappropriate if there is a\\nreasonable explanation of why an employ ee’s earning s are not substantia l. An\\nexample of a reasonable explanation would be the employ ee’s inability  to\\nperform the full responsibilities of the job due to reduced pace or hours. “It\\n8 The tiered earnings scheme, with primary and secondary guidelines amounts, was discontinued beg inning\\nin 2001.

Id.\\n2.The ALJ erroneous ly concluded that the claimant’s self-employ ment\\nconstitutes SGA as set forth in SSR 83-34.\\nApplicabl e law: SSR 83-34 provides that work will be considered SGA if it\\nmeets one of three tests. The first test for self-employ ment concerns whether\\nthe individual renders significant services to and receives a substantial income\\nfrom the business. The second and third tests look to the comparab ility of the\\nwork to that of unimpaired people in similar businesses/occupations and to the\\nworth of the work activity . Id. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in\\naccordance with the Ruling  and 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1575, 416.975.9\\nSSR 83-34 provides that work activity  must be in accordance with three tests\\nbefore it can be determined not to constitute SGA. However, if one test\\nindicates the work qualifies as SGA, the inquiry  ceases and the work activity\\nis deemed SGA without reg ard to the other tests.\\nThe first test focuses on whether the individual renders significant services to\\nand receives a substantial income from the business. To find SGA under the\\nfirst test, both conditions must be met: the provision of significant services to\\nand receipt of a substantial income from the business. According  to the\\nRuling , the services of someone engaged in a one-person business are\\nnecessarily  significant. The only question remaining  for such individuals\\nconcerns whether the income received is substantial. For businesses involving\\nthe services of two or more people, an “owner or partner will be found to be\\nrendering  significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total\\ntime required for management of the business, or renders manag ement\\nservices for more than 45 hours a mont h regardless of the total manag ement\\ntime required by the busine ss.” Id. A farm landlord performs significant\\nservices if he or she materially participates in crop or livestock production or\\nmanag ement. Material participation is explained in the regulations at 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1082.\\nAn individual receives “substantial income” if: (1) the amount of “countable\\nincome” derived from the business on averag e for the calendar year exceeds\\nthe applicable earning s guideline; (2) the livelihood derived from the business\\nis comparable to that during  his or her pre-disability  period; or (3) the\\nlivelihood derived is comparable to that of unimpaired people making  a living\\n9 See also SSR 12- 1p (evaluation of SGA f or blind se lf-employed claimants).\\n38\\nin the same or similar businesses. Countable income is determined by\\ncalculating  the income representing  the person’s own productivity , which is\\ndone throug h figuring net income and then deducting  the reasona ble value of\\nany significant amount of unpaid help furnished by others, impairment-related\\nwork expenses, unincurred business expenses paid for by others, and certain\\nsoil bank payments. The Ruling  discusses the determination of the value of\\nthese deductions. Id.\\nIf averag e monthly  countable income does not exceed the applicable guideline\\namount,10 the individual may still receive “substantial income” from the\\nbusiness under the second standard if he or she continues to receive a\\nlivelihood comparable to that received for a number of years before disability .\\nThis standard is applicable where the business formed “the sole means of\\nlivelihood” during  the earlier years. The Ruling  cautions, moreover, that\\n“chronic illness or other special circumstances existing  from some time prior\\nto the individual’s becoming  disabled may indicate that his or her financial\\nsituation in that period should not be considered an indication of the\\nindividual’s standard of livelihood .” If that is the case, the third test for\\nsubstantial income would be “more pertinent.”\\nThe last test for substantial income indicates SGA will be found where the\\ncommunity  standard of livelihood for similar businesses is met, without\\nregard to the individual’s pre-disability  circumstances. SSR 83- 34 recog nizes\\nthat in determining  the community  standard, unrepresentative individuals\\nmust be excluded—for example, individuals whose “chronic illness accounts\\nfor a low level of income.”\\nThe second and third tests are discussed together by the Ruling . These look to\\nthe comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired people in similar\\nbusinesses and to the worth of the work activity , respectively . The second test\\nfor SGA asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to that of\\nunimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar businesses.\\nUnder the second test for SGA, the individual’s  work activity  is assessed “in\\nterms of all relevant factors such as hours, skills, energ y output, efficiency,\\nduties, and responsibilities[ .]” SSR 83-34 provides that each factor must be\\ndescribed in detail by the adjudicator, showing  its contribution to the business.\\nIf this activity  is established by conclusive evidence to be comparable to that\\nof unimpaired people who: (1) reside in the same community ; (2) are engaged\\nin the same or similar businesses, with the type of self-employ ment being  the\\nsame; and (3) are so engaged as their means of livelihood, the individual may\\nbe considered to be performing  SGA. Inconclusive evidence, including\\ngeneral rather than specific descriptions of the relevant factors, “will result in\\na finding  that work performed is not SGA.” Doubts must be resolved in favor\\nof the claimant. Further, the comparison group must derive a standard of\\n10 Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted yearly at: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed May 1,\\n2024) .\\n39\\nliving  considered adequate for the community .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that it might be necessa ry to develop the record\\nwith more information about the claimant’s activ ities than he or she can\\nprovide. “Contact, therefore, should be made with people having firsthand\\nknowledg e of the impaired individual’s work situation obtained  through\\nactual participation or observation.”\\nThe third and final test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the\\nindividual’s work activity  is clearly  worth more than the otherwise applicable\\namount listed in the earning s guidelines. The work activity  must be\\nconsidered either in relation to its value to the business or to the salar y an\\nowner would pay  an employ ee for the work.\\n3.The ALJ did not properly  averag e the claimant’s earnings  as set forth in SSR\\n83-35 in finding  that s/he eng aged in SGA.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-35 describes when and how averag ing countable\\nearning s or incom e is done for SGA determination purposes. It explains\\naverag ing in initial disability  cases and in continuing  disability  cases, except\\nduring  the reentitlement period.\\nIn determining  whether an employ ee’s averag e monthly  earning s\\npresumptively  indicate SGA by exceedin g the Earning s Guidelines,11 some\\nmethod is necessary  in cases where earnings  vary significantly  over time or\\nthe guidelines earnings level chang es. SSR 83-35 explains that in such cases\\n“it will be necessary  to average separately  the distinct periods of work\\ninvolved when there is a regulatory change in the SGA earning s level or there\\nis a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or earning s.”\\nSSR 83-35 diffe rentiates between earning s varying “somewhat” over the\\nmonths at issue and earning s that reflect a “significant chang e.” It explains\\nthat earning s or work activities varying “somewhat” require averagi ng “over a\\nnumber of months” before comparison with the Earning s Guidelines.12\\nSSR 83-55 states that certain situations require averag ing of earning s over\\ndistinct periods. It will be necessary  to averag e separately  the distinc t periods\\nof work involved when there is either (1) a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearnings level; or (2) a significant chang e in work patterns or income. The\\nfirst circumstance is straig htforward and can be determined by reference to\\nthe guidelines table, with earning s averaged over each period for which a\\ndifferent SGA level applies. Concerning  the second circumstance, the Ruling\\nstates:\\n11 Presumptive SGA a mounts, upda ted yearly, found a t: \\nhttp://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/ COL A/sga.html (Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .  \\n12 The  Ruling does not define “somewhat.”\\n40\\nWhen there is significant chang e in work patterns or earning s during  the\\nperiod of work requiring  evaluation, earning s are not averag ed over the\\nentire period of work involved. When there is such a change, it would not\\nbe appropriate to averag e earning s over the entire period of work, since\\none period of work activity  may not be representative of the other period.\\nUnrepresentative periods of work involve separate and distinct work\\nefforts. When there is a significant chang e in work patterns or earning s,\\nthe earnin gs must be averag ed over each separate period of work involved\\nto determine if either effort was SGA.\\nThe implication of this Ruling  is that when there is no “separate and distinct\\nwork effort,” but rather the same job, earning s must be averaged over the\\nwhole relevant period.\\nSSR 83-55 explain s how averaging is applied to the income of self- employ ed\\nindividuals.  While similar in many  respects to the assessment of the earning s\\nof employ ed people, a determination of averag e monthly  income for self-\\nemploy ed individuals must “consider whether the period of time included in\\ndetermining  averag e monthly  ‘countable income’ is, in fact, representativ e of\\nthe individual’s financial situation during  the period involved in the SGA\\nissue.”  The Ruling explains that ordinarily  income is to be averag ed over the\\nentire period of work at issue, as with employ ees, except where there is an\\nSGA earning s level chang e or “a significant chang e in work patterns or\\nincome.” It is necessary  to averag e a self-employ ed “individual’s ‘countable\\nincome’ by figuring total ‘countable income’ over a representative period and\\ndividing  by the number of months in that period”- separately  averag ing\\ndistinct periods of work “when there is a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearning s level or there is a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or income.”\\nSSR 83-35 also provides that engagement in SGA may be attributed to the\\nentire period. The Ruling  notes that where averag ed earning s or income\\nindicates SGA, “an individual may for purposes of the disability\\ndetermination be considered to have engaged continuously  in SGA  during the\\nentire period being  averag ed.”\\nFinally , SSR 83-35 addresses situations where a claimant has either stopped\\nworking  or has only recently  begun a pattern of work. In cases where a\\nclaimant is no longer working, but previously  worked for a continuous period,\\nearnings are to be averag ed over the actual period of work involved. On the\\nother hand, where the person has been empl oyed only a short time, such as 3\\nor 4 weeks, an evaluat ion must be made based on “the individual’s expected\\nwork pattern and earning s. If work was going on at the time of last contact\\nwith the individual, evaluation should be made in anticipation of its\\ncontinuance without other interruptions, in the absence of evidence clearly\\nindicating  the contrary .” A revision may be warranted, howev er, if subsequent\\nevidence shows the anticipated level of earning s did not materializ e.  Id.\\nFor details, see POMS DI  10505.015, Averag ing Countable Earning s.\\n41\\n4.The ALJ erroneously  concluded that the claimant’s employ ment constitutes\\nSGA without properly  considering  work-related subsidies as set forth in SSR\\n83-33.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-33 provides that an individual’s “countable\\nearning s” are calculated by subtracting  from gross earning s the amount of any\\nsubsidiz ed earning s from the employ er and the amount of certain impairme nt-\\nrelated work expenses paid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable\\nearning s are then compared to the applicable presumptive amount.\\nEarning s are considered subsidized when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services. SSR. The Ruling\\nindicates that usually the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s services according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work. Id.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple  tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow, inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” Id. The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Id. Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does  not fully  earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-spon sored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nWhere an employ er cannot provide an adequate explanation of how a subsidy\\nwas calculated, the agency  must question the employer in regard to the need\\nfor the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her pay to those\\nservices.  Id.  For more details, see POMS DI 10505.010(A) Determining\\nCountable Earning s, Subsidies.\\n5.The AL J erred by  counting  earning s from an unsuccessful work attempt.\\nApplicable law: In accordance with the unsuccessful work attempt (UW A)\\nrule discussed in SSR 83-34 and SSR 83-35, work activity  does not\\n42\\ndemonstra te an ability  to engage in SGA if, after working  no more than six\\nmonths, the individual involuntarily  discontinues or reduces such work  below\\nthe SGA level for reasons relating  to his or her impairment. The rule applies\\nto both employ ees and self-employ ed individuals. Id. See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1574(c)(1), 416.974(c)(1).  The regulations define an UWA as work that\\na claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her\\nimpairments.  Id.  SSR 84-25 prov ides that the UWA must be preceded by a\\nperiod when the claimant is either not working or performing  work below the\\nSGA level. A claimant can have a series of UWAs: “each continuous\\nperilosingrated by significant breaks as described, may be an UWA as long as\\ncriteria as to duration and conditions of work are met. . . .”  \\nIf the work lasted less than six months, it is an UWA if the claimant stopped\\nor reduced work earning s below SGA level as a result of the impairment or\\nthe removal of “special conditions that took into account your impairment and\\npermitted you to work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1574(c)(3), 416.974(c)(3).  Work\\nthat lasted more than six months at the SGA level is not “an unsuccessful\\nwork attempt regardless of why it ended or was reduced below [SGA]  level.” \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574(c)(4), 416.974(c)(4).\\n6.Work performed for fewer than 30 calend ar days is not considered past\\nrelevant work, even if it was performed at the SGA level.  \\nUnder revised regulations, SSA will also no longer consider past work that\\nstarted and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days to be past relevant work. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.965(b)(1)(ii).  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) specifically  provides:\\n(ii) 30 calendar days . When we consider past relevant work and work\\nexperience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30\\nconsecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.\\nWhen we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do\\nnot consider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period,\\nor whether the work was full-time or part-time. The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\nactiv ity or whether you worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthoug h the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntowa rd the time needed for you to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contra ctor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSee also SSR 24-2p (also providing  that work is not PRW  if it the work\\nstarted and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar day s).  \\nSSR 24-2p explains that if a claimant was self-emp loyed or an independent\\ncontractor, SSA will consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type\\n43\\nof work for 30 calendar days even if individual work assignments or contracts\\neach lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are\\nprovided in SSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW\\nincludes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30\\ncalendar days or more because the individual did the same job for at least 30\\ncalendar days even thoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped\\nwithin a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. SSR 24-2p provides two\\nexamples interpreting  the 30 calendar day  requirement:\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW if it was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample 2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during the 5-year relevant work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ did not address  impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) as\\nrequired as set forth in SSRs 83-33 and 84-26.\\nApplicable law: SSR 84-26 explains in detail SSA policy  regarding  IRWE\\nfor people who meet the SSA definition of disability . Under certain\\ncircumstances, an individual’s expenses are deducted from his or her income\\nwhen determining  whether that income reflects SGA.\\nThe cost of certain items and services can be deducted from an impaired\\nperson’s earning s when determining  SGA . Generally , these must be items and\\nservices the person needs in order to work, althoug h they may simul taneously\\nbe required for normal daily  activiti es. SSR  84-26 specifies that where an\\nIRWE otherwise qualifies, it is irrelevant that the equipment or service “is\\nalso needed to enable the indivi dual to carry  out normal daily  functions[ .]”\\nThe entire amount of the expense is deductible, without any reduction.\\nAllowable amounts are subject to reasonable limits, and to qualify  the\\npayments for the items and services must have been made by the impaired\\nindividual.\\nSSR 84-26 discusses in detail qualify ing expenses in six major categ ories and\\nprovides multiple examples in relation thereto and explains what showing  of\\nnecessity , if any, is required for each categ ory. These six major categ ories are\\n44\\n(1) attendant care services; (2) medical devices; (3) prostheses; (4) other\\nequipment; (5) routine drugs and routine medical services; and (6) similar\\nitems and services. Multiple examples are set forth of services and equipment\\nthat are deductible in appropriate circumstances . No separate showing  of\\nnecessity  is requir ed with regard to prostheses, whereas medical devices\\nqualify  when they are primarily  used for a medical purpose and are not\\ngenerally  useful to healthy  individua ls. However, the needs met by attendant\\ncare services must be “essential” and the services shown necessary  to enable\\nthe person to work. Similarly , to qualify  as “other equipment” an item must be\\nneeded for performing  required job tasks, “or to move from home to mode of\\ntransportation, or to control the disabli ng condition at home or in the work\\nsetting  so as to be able to function in a work activity .” Routine drugs and\\nmedical services, as well as similar items and services, must also be necessary\\nfor enabling  the individual to work.\\nSSR 84-26 clarifies that the impaired individual must be the one who pays the\\ncost of the equipment or services. In other words, the expense “has not been,\\ncannot be, and will not be, reimbursed by any source for the expense.”\\nFurther, payment must be made in “cash,” which includes checks or other\\nforms of money  but not pay ment in-kind. Proof of pay ment must be provided.\\nSSR 84-26 also caution s that the deductible amount of IRWE “is subject to\\nreasonable limits”:\\nGenerally , the amount paid for medical services, medical device...,\\nprostheses, and similar medically -related items and services will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it is no more than the Medicare prevailing  charg e\\nestabl ished for the same item or service in the individual’s locale under\\nPart B of title XVIII of the Social Security  Act (Health Insurance for the\\nAged and Disabled).\\nPrevailing  charg e information is available from individual Medicare carriers\\nthroug h Social Security  district offices. If the amount paid for an item or\\nservice exceeds the Medicar e prevailing  charg e in the individual’s locale, an\\namount equal to the prevailing  charg e will be deducted from earni ngs.  If the\\nimpaired individual wishes  to establish the reasonableness of the amount paid,\\nhe or she may rebut the prevailing  charg e guidelines by demonst rating  that the\\namount paid is consistent with the standard or normal charg e for the same or\\nsimilar item or service in his or her community .  If the reported item or\\nservice is not listed in the Medicare guidelines, the amount paid will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it does not exceed the standard or normal charge for\\nthe same or similar item or service in the impaired individual’s community .\\nAdditionally , when IRWE deductions are taken, SGA is ordinar ily determined\\nby focusing on earnings rather than the value of services rendered.  The\\nRuling  notes that in cases involving  IRWE deductions, the SGA decision will\\ngeneral ly be based strictly  on the individual’s earning s rather than the value of\\nservices the individual rendered. There is an exception, howev er: “the\\n45\\nsituation in which a person is in a position to control or manipulate the\\namount of his or her earning s, e.g., the person is self-employ ed and the value\\nof services rendered is clearly  worth an amount  greater than the earning s\\nreceived.”\\nFinally , SSR 84-26 explains that the provision regarding  IRWE deductions\\ndoes not apply  to determinations of whether a month of “services” is\\ncharg eable for trial work period purp oses. “In other words, deductions will\\nnot be made to determine whether a person’s monthly  earning s can be reduced\\nto $75 or less.”  Id. \\nFor more details, see POMS DI 10520.001 Impairment-Related Work\\nExpenses (I RWE).\\n8.The ALJ erred by excluding the blind claimant’s income related to vending\\nmachine operation when determining  whether SGA was being  performed.\\nApplicable law: SSR 12-1p discusses the treatment of income that blind self-\\nemploy ed vendors receive under the Randolph-Sheppard Act (and similar\\nState programs) from vending  machines that are located on the same property ,\\nbut are not serviced, operated, or maintained by the blind vendor.13  This\\nincome is subtracted from the person’s income before the total is compared to\\nthe applicable guideline as it is not a measure of his or her own productivity . \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1584, 416.984.\\nB.

Basic work activities mean the “abilities and\\naptitudes necessary  to do most jobs.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1522(a), 416.922(a). \\nThese include physical functions, such as walking , standin g, sitting , lifting ,\\npushing, pulling , reaching , carry ing, or handling ; capacities for seeing ,\\nhearing , and speaking ; understanding , carry ing out, and remembering  simple\\ninstructions; use of judgment; respon ding appropriately  to supervision, co-\\nworkers, and usual work situations; and dealing  with changes in a routine\\nwork setting . Id.   \\nMost circuits have adopted a slight abnormality  standard for severity , holding\\nthat an impairment is not severe if it is only a slight abnormality  which has\\nsuch a minimal effect on the claimant that it would not be expected to\\ninterfere with his or her ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or\\nwork experience.

Social Security  Ruling 17-2p, effective March 27, 2017,\\napplies to all pending claims, not only to claims filed on and after March 27,\\n2017, and replaces SSR 96-6p. SSR 17-2p states that, while at the initial and\\nreconsideration levels medical equivalence is determined by medical and/or\\npsycholog ical consultants, at the hearing  level it is ALJs “and some attorney\\nadvisors” who determine medi cal equivalence. To assist in the evaluation,\\nadjudicators “may ” request and consider medical expert evidence.  Similarly ,\\nwhere the Appeals Council issues a decis ion, it “may  ask its medical support\\n50\\nstaff  to help decide whether an individual’s impairment(s) medically  equals a\\nlisting .”\\nSSR 17-2p prohibits an adjudicator from finding  that a claimant’s\\nimpairments are medically  equivalen t to a listed impairment unless a medical\\nconsultant, psycholog ical consultant, medical expert, or Appeal s Council\\nmedical support staff opines that the claimant’s impairments(s) medic ally\\nequal the listing .  However, under the Ruling , an ALJ or the Appeals Council\\nare not required to obtain an opinion from a medical expert about medical\\nequivalence if the ALJ or the Appeals Council believes that the evidence does\\nnot reasonably  support a medical equivalence finding.  Further, an ALJ may\\nnot rely on a medical expert’s conclusory  opinion that a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s ) medically  equal the listing , but “must ask the ME to identify\\nmedical evidence in the record that supports the ME’s” opinion that a listing\\nis medically  equaled.\\nIn addition, if an ALJ determin es that a claimant’s impairments medically\\nequal the listing , the ALJ “must articulate how the record establishes medical\\nequival ency using  one of the three methods specified in 20 C.F.R. 404.1526\\nand 416.926.”  If an ALJ finds that a claimant’s impairments do not medically\\nequal a listing , that finding  alone is generally  sufficient articul ation for the\\nfinding .\\nD.

A medical assessmen t of what an\\nindividua l can do in a work setting  in spite of the functional limitations\\nand environmental restrictions imposed by all of his or her medi cally\\ndeterminable impairment(s).

SSR 85-15 provides that:\\n[t]he basic mental demands of com petitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supervision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations ; and to deal with chang es in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial  loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experience will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nSSR 85-16 cautions that a conclusion an individ ual can perform SGA is “not\\nto be inferred merely  from the fact that the mental disorder is not of listing\\nseverity.”  Id.  Further, the Ruling  provides that determining  mental RFC\\ninvolves the consider ation of evidence including : (1) all relevant history ,\\nfinding s and observations from medical sources; (2) reports of daily  living\\nand work activities; (3) third-party  testimony  regarding  performance and\\nbehavior; and (4) reports from workshops, group homes, or similar entities. \\nId.\\nThe Commissioner’s Ruling s demonstrate the need for presen tation of a\\nspecific, valid rationale supporting  any finding  that an individual’s\\nnonex ertional limitations do not signific antly limit basic work skills.  In\\n54\\naccordance with SSR 83-14, in cases involving  a combination of exertional\\nand nonex ertional impa irments, “[t]he usual requirements apply  for a clear,\\npersuasive, orderly  rationale.  There must be finding s of fact and recitation  of\\nthe evidence which supports each finding .” Likewise, SSR 85-15\\n“emphasiz e[s] the importance of thoroughness in evaluation on an\\nindividualiz ed basis” where a mental impairment is present.\\n4.The ALJ’s RFC assessment is deficient  as a matter of law because instead of\\ndetermining  the claimant’s ability  to perform basic work-related activities, the\\nALJ cited to the four factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a\\nwhich are part of the psy chiatric review technique evaluation.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 96-8p provides that in assessing  a claimant’s RFC, the\\nALJ is required to make finding s regarding  whether the claimant can: (1)\\nunderstand, carry out, and remember simple instructions; (2) respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations; and (3)\\ndeal with chang es in a routine work setting .  The four factors set forth in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a are part of the Psychiatric Review Technique\\nevaluation and are not suffici ently detailed to constitute ultimate RFC\\nfinding s.  As set forth in SSR 96-8p:\\nThe psychiatric  review technique described in 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and\\n416.920a and summariz ed on the Psychiatric Review Technique Form\\n(PRTF ) requires adjudicators to assess an individual’s limitations and\\nrestrictions from a mental impairment(s) in categ ories identified in the\\n“parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria of the adult mental disorders\\nlisting s.  The adjudicator must remember that the limitations identified in\\nthe “parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria are not an RFC assessment\\nbut are used to rate the severity  of mental impai rment(s) at steps 2 and 3\\nof the sequential evaluation process.  The mental RFC assessment used at\\nsteps 4 and 5 of the sequential evaluation process requir es a more detailed\\nassessment by itemiz ing various functions contained in the broad\\ncateg ories found in parag raphs B and C of the adult mental disorder\\nlisting s in 12.00 of the Listing  of Impairments and summariz ed on the\\nPRTF.\\n5.The ALJ’s mental RFC assessment is deficient as a matter of law because\\nthe ALJ did not [account for/build upon]  the finding s made as part of the\\npsychiatric review technique evauation.\\n6. The ALJ failed to account for his/her PRTF findings in the RFC\\nassessment, such as a moderate limitation in interacting with others as the\\nALJ did not address interacti on with supervisors, co-workers and/or the\\npublic.\\nApplicable law:  As “[t]he mental RFC assessment used at steps  4 and 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process requires a more detailed assessment”\\nthan the Psychiatric Review Technique evaluation, SSR 96-8p, the ALJ\\n55\\ncannot overlook or fail to expand upon the finding s made as part of that\\nevaluation.

A complete\\ninability  to stoop would significantly  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and a finding  that the individual is disabled would\\nusually  apply  . . . .\\nLight work also requires stooping  occasionally , or at least one-third of the\\nworkday .

Even thoug h the weig ht lifted in a\\nparticular light job may be very  little, a job is in this categ ory when it\\nrequires a good deal of walking  or standing  – the primary  difference\\nbetween sedentary  and most lig ht jobs.\\n“Frequent” means occurring  from one-third to two-thirds of the time. \\nSince frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full rang e of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking , off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .  Sitting  may occur intermittently  during  the remaining  time. \\nThe lifting  requ irement for the majority  of light jobs can be accomplished\\nwith occasional, rather than frequent, stooping .  Many  unskilled light jobs\\nare performed primarily  in one location, with the ability  to stand being\\nmore critical than the ability  to walk.  They  require use of arms and hands\\nto grasp and to hold and turn objects, and they generally  do not require use\\nof the fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary\\nwork.\\n10.As the evidence documents that the claimant lacks the ability  to stand and\\nwork for 6 hours out of an 8-hour workday , s/he cannot, in fact, perform light\\nwork as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday .  As set forth in SSR 83-10, light work\\nentails “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the “primary difference\\nbetween sedentary and most light jobs.” (Emphasis added).

Further, SSR 96-8p provides that:\\nin order for an individual to do a full range of work at a given exertional\\nlevel, such as sedentary , the individual must be able to perform\\nsubstantially all of the exertional and nonex ertional functions required in\\nwork at that level.  Therefore, it is nece ssary to assess the individual’s\\ncapacity  to perform each of these functions in order to decide which\\nexertional level is appropriate and whether the individual is capable of\\ndoing  the full rang e of work contemplated by  the ex ertional level.\\nId. (Emphasis added).\\n11.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can perform the full range of medium\\nwork is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law :  Medium work is defined in SSR 83-10 as follows:\\nThe regulations define medium work as lifting  no more than 50 pounds at\\na time with freque nt lifting or carry ing of objects weighing up to 25\\npounds.  A full range of medium work requires standi ng or walking , off\\nand on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours in an 8-hour workday  in order\\nto meet the requirements of frequent lifting or carry ing objects weig hing\\nup to 25 pounds.  As in light work, sitting  may occur intermittently  during\\nthe remaining  time.  Use of the arms and hands is necessary  to grasp, hold,\\nand turn objects, as opposed to the finer activities in much sedentary work,\\nwhich require precision use of the fingers as well as use of the hands and\\narms.\\nThe considerable lifting  required for the full range of medium work\\nusually  requires frequent bending -stooping  (Stooping  is a type of bending\\nin which a person bends his or her body  downward and forw ard by\\nbend ing the spine at the waist.) Flexibility  of the knees as well as the torso\\nis important for this activity.  (Crouching  is bending  both the legs and\\nspine in order to bend the body downward and forward .)  However, there\\nare a relatively  few occupa tions in the national economy  which require\\nexertion in terms of weig hts that must be lifted at times (or involve\\n59\\nequivalent exertion in pushing  or pulling ), but are performed primarily  in\\na sitting  position, e.g., taxi driver, bus driver, and tank-truck driver\\n(semiskilled jobs).  In most medium jobs, being on one’s feet for most of\\nthe workday  is critical. Being able to do frequent lifting  or carry ing of\\nobjects weig hing up to 25 pounds is often more critical than being able to\\nlift up to 50 pounds at a time.\\n12.Given the evidence of record that the claimant uses a cane, the ALJ’s finding\\nthat s/he can perform the exertional demands of light work cannot be\\nsustained.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday . Indeed, according  to the Commissioner’s\\npolicies, light work entai ls “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the\\n“primary difference between sedentary and mos t light jobs.”  Social Security\\nRuling  83-10 (empha sis added).  In order to be able to frequently  lift or carry\\nobjects weig hing up to 10 pounds which is requi red to perform light work, an\\nindividual must be able to stand or walk, off and on, for approximately six\\nhours out of an 8-hour day :\\nSince  frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full range of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking, off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .  Sitting  may occur intermittently  during  the remaining  time. \\nThe lifting  requirement for the majority  of light jobs can be accomplished\\nwith occasional, rather than frequent, stooping .  Many  unskilled light jobs\\nare performed primarily  in one location, with the ability  to stand being\\nmore critical than the ability  to walk.  They  require use of arms and hands\\nto grasp and to hold and turn objects, and they generally  do not require use\\nof the fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary\\nwork.\\nId.  An individual who uses a cane for ambulation cannot perform the\\nstanding , walking , and lifting  entailed in the performance of lig ht work.\\nThe regulations specifically  recognize that the “requirement to use a hand-\\nheld assistive device may . . . impact on the individual’s functional capacity\\nby virtue of the fact that one or both upper extremities are not available for\\nsuch activities as lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pullin g.”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(J)(4).  Social Security  Ruling  96-9p recog nizes that\\nthe ability to perform sedentary work may be impacted by the use of a cane.\\nSee SSR 96-9p (stating  that “the occupational base for an individual who must\\nuse [an assistive] device for balance because of significant involvement of\\nboth lower extremities (e.g., because of a neurolog ical impairment) may be\\nsignificantly  eroded”). While the use of such a device does not alway s impact\\nthe ability to perform sedentary  work in light of the “minimal lifting  and\\ncarry ing requirements of many sedentary  unskilled occupations,” this is not\\ntrue for light work, which entails frequent lifting  of up to 20 pounds. See also\\n60\\nPOMS DI 25015.020(B )(6) (addressing  “Medically  required hand-held\\nassistive device”).\\nG. STEP 4 - AB ILITY TO RETURN T O PAST  RELEVANT WORK\\n1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claiman t’s job as a *** is past relevant work is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  conside red past work performed more than five years\\nprior to the date of the decision [or date last insured] , in violation of 20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 416.960(b)(1)(i) and SSR 24-2p.\\nApplicable law.  The regulations define work experience as the skills and\\nabilities the claimant has acquired throug h prior work which shows the type of\\nwork you may be expected to do.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  The SSA\\nhas issued a final rule effective June 22, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to\\nthe Disability Adjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work,\\n89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024), 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5, 2024)\\n(deferring  effective date to J une 22, 2024).  \\nAmong  other provisions, the rule revises the definition of past relevant work\\nby reducing  the relevant work period from 15 years to five years.  This final\\nrule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability\\nreview cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial\\ndisability  sequential evaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no\\nlonger consider past work that started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar\\ndays to be past relevant work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii),\\n416.965(b)(1)(ii). \\nSSA makes these revisio ns in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and\\n416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years\\nthat was substantial gainful activity  and that lasted long enoug h for you to\\nlearn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We will not consider work to be past\\nrelevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar days\\n(see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consider past relevant work and work experience (see §\\n404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30 consecutive days,\\nincluding  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.  When we\\nconsider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period, or\\nwhether the work was full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\n61\\nactivity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthough the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntoward the time needed for you to learn to do the work. The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contractor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a) : \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. 404.1565(a), 416.965(a) from the prior\\ntext, “If you have no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for\\nbrief periods of time during  the five- year period, we generally  consider\\nthat these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as, “If you have no work\\nexperience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)( 1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear\\nperiod, we generally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the\\njustification for the rule is to allow individuals to focus on the most\\ncurrent and relevant information about their past work, better reflect the\\ncurrent evidence base on chang es over time in worke r skill decay  and job\\nresponsibilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service,\\nand reduce the burden on individuals. \\nPursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued SSR 24-2p,  Titles II and XVI: How\\nWe Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effec tive June 22, 2024, which rescinds\\nSSR 86-8, and rescinds  and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose\\nof the new ruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether  an individual\\nretai ns the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their\\npast relevant work and to explain the policy set forth in SSA’s regulations so\\nthat those regulations will be consistently  applied.   See SSR 24-2p, 2024 WL\\n3291790 (S.S.A. J une 6, 2024); 89 F ed. Reg . 48479 (J une 6, 2024).  \\nAccor ding to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured\\nfrom the date of the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  However, in\\nsome situations, the relevan t period is measured from an earlier date. This\\nruling  includes a table that provides g uidelines for common scenarios.  \\n3.The ALJ erred in failing  to comply  with SSR 24-2p, which applies to this\\ncase.\\nApplicable law .  SSA will apply  SSR 24-2p on and after its applicable date of\\nJune 22, 2024, in any case in which the agency  makes a determination or\\ndecision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for further\\nadministrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR 24-2p, SSA will\\napply  this ruling to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the\\ncourt’s remand.  \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant did not work\\nlong  enoug h to learn how to do the work.\\n62\\n5.The ALJ conceded in his/h er decision at step one of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess that the claimant was not engaged in substantial gainful activity , and\\ntherefore erred in finding  that the claimant can return to this work.\\n6.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant only did work\\nthat started and stopped in a period of fewer  than 30 calendar days during  the\\npast five-y ear period.\\nApplicable law .  SSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that was performed: \\n•within the past five y ears; \\n•was substantial g ainful activity  (SGA) and \\n•lasted long  enoug h for the individual to learn to do preform the work.  \\nSee 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)) and 416.960(b)(1)(i).  According  to SSR\\n24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that:\\nThe individual gained sufficient job experience to learn the techniques,\\nacquire information, and develop the facility  needed for averag e\\nperfo rmance in the job. The length of time this would take depends on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific\\nvocational preparation (SVP).\\nSSR 24-2p provides that work is not PRW  if it the work started and stopped in\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s, defined as:\\na period of 30 consecu tive days, including  weekends, starting  from the\\nfirst day of work. We generally  do not consider the total number of hours\\nor days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or\\npart-time. The 30 calendar days require ment is separate from the\\nconsideration of SGA or whether an individual worked long enoug h to\\nlearn  how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days may count toward\\nthe time needed for an individual to learn to do the work.\\n Moreover, if a claimant was self-employed or an independent contractor, SSA\\nwill consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type of work for 30\\ncalendar days even if individual work assig nments or contracts each lasted\\nfewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are provided in\\nSSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW  includes “gig\\necon omy” work such as an individual who completed 20 different shopping\\ntrips for a grocery delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or more\\nbecause the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even\\nthoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSSR 24-2p provides examples interpr eting the 30 calendar day requirement.  \\nThe ruling  lists the following  two ex amples:\\n63\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW  if it was perfor med at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample  2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year relevant  work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to her past relevant work as she\\nactually  performed it (or as genera lly performed) is not based on substantial\\nevidence.   \\nApplicable law:  There are two methods used to determine whether a\\nclaimant can perform his or her PRW  – whether the claima nt can perform the\\nwork as “actually  performed” or as “generally  performed in the national\\neconomy .”  SSR 24-2p states that “[a]s they actually performed the work”\\nlooks to whethe r the claimant retains the “RFC to perform the particular\\nfunctional demands peculiar to the work the individual did.” \\nIn evaluating  work as “generally  performed  in the national economy ,” SSA\\nlooks to whether the claimant “retains the capacity  to perform the\\noccupation’s functional deman ds as ordinarily  required throug hout the\\nnation al economy ,” based on descriptions of occupations from reliable\\nsources of job information to determine how occupati ons are generally\\nperformed. A vocational witness may also provide information about  how an\\noccupation is generally  perfor med in the national economy .  SSR 24-2p also\\nexplains:\\nIf the individual cannot meet the functional demands actually  requir ed in\\nthe former job but can meet the functional demands as generally  required\\nthroug hout the economy , we will find the individual able to perform PRW\\nand not disabled.\\nIn determining  whether a claimant can perfor m a job as “actually  performed,”\\nthe claimant’s job may have involved functional demands that are different\\nfrom those generally  required for the occupation throug hout the national\\neconomy .  If the claimant cannot meet the functional demands actually\\nrequired in the former job but can meet the functional demands as generally\\nrequired throug hout the economy , SSA will find the individual able to\\nperform PRW  and is not disabled.\\n64\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work\\nare generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. However, if individual cannot provide this\\ninformation,  with the individual’s permission, SSA will attempt to get it from\\ntheir employ er or another person who knows about the individual’s work,\\nsuch as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nSSA will ask the claimant to describe all of the work perfor med in the last 5\\nyears (unless the job started and stopped  in fewer than 30 calendar days),\\nincluding :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking, standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the\\nindividual did during  the workday , as well as any other physical or\\nmental demands of their work.\\n \\n8.While the ALJ summaril y concluded that the claimant can return to his/her\\npast relevant work, s/he provided no specific findings  or analy sis regarding\\nthe phy sical and mental demands of this work, as required by SSR 24-2p.\\n9.The ALJ did not fulfill his/her duty, under SSR 24-2p, to develop the record\\nregarding  the claimant’s past work.\\nApplicable law.  SSR 24-2p provides that statements by a claimant about past\\nwork is generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and\\nmental demands of such work.  However, if the claimant cannot provide this\\ninformation, with the claimant’s permission, SSA will attempt get it from\\nothers, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the claimant to\\ndescribe all of the work perfor med in the last 5 years (unless the job started\\nand stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days), including  the dates they worked,\\nthe duties they performed, any tools, machinery , and equipment they used and\\nthe amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carrying the individual\\ndid during  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\nSSR 24-2p provides that SSA determines whether an individual can perform\\ntheir past relevant work (PRW ) by considering whether the individual retains\\nthe RFC to meet the functional demands of any of their PRW , as they actual ly\\nperformed it, or as it is generally  performed in the national economy . This\\nRuling  explains the information SSA needs to make this determination:\\nTo determine whether an individual can perform PRW , we need\\ninformation about the physical and mental demands of PRW , particularly\\n65\\nas relevant to the individual’s RF C. This may  include:\\n \\n•detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental\\ndemands, and other job requirements; \\n•the dates work was performed; \\n•tools and machines used;\\n•the ex tent of supervision required, and\\n•a description of tasks and responsibilities.\\nIf more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, we will request\\nseparate descriptions of each  job the individual performed during  the relevant\\nperiod.\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, determination of the individual’s ability to do PRW\\nrequires careful consideration of:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no\\nlong er be met and the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those\\nrequirements;\\n•the individual’s RF C;  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corrob orative information from other\\nsources on the requirements of the work as actually  performed by the\\nindividual or as g enerally  performed in the economy .\\nThe ALJ’s decision that an individual is not disabled, based on the ability  to\\nperform PRW , must contain adequate rationale and finding s of fact. SSR 24-\\n2p provides:\\nA determination or decision that an individual is not disabled, based on\\ntheir ability  to perform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step\\nfour of the sequential evaluation process, must contain adequate rationale\\nand finding s.\\nSpecifically , in finding  that an individua l has the capacity  to perform PRW ,\\nthe determination or decision must:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\n66\\nperformed in the national economy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the\\nPRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .\\nUnder SSR 24-2p, the ALJ’s decision must contain adequate rationale and\\nfindings which “consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either\\nas the individual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .”  \\n10.The ALJ misclassified the streng th requirements of the claimant’s past\\nrelevant work by the lightest duties performed, when, in fact, it was actually  a\\ncomposite job which also entailed more strenuous duties.\\n   11.The ALJ erred in not recognizing that the claimant performed a  “composite\\njob” which entailed  the duties of two jobs as discussed in POMS DI\\n25005.020(B ) and thus committed legal error in finding  that s/he can return to\\nthe least strenuous of his/her past duties. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that, after comparing  the claimant’s\\nresidual functional capacity  with “the physical and mental demands of [his or\\nher] past relevant work,” if the claimant “can still do this kind of work,” the\\nclaimant is not disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(f), 416.920(f).  A composite\\njob in one which entails duties which are performed at different exertional\\nlevels.  \\nPOMS DI 25005.020 addresses past relevant work as performed by a claimant\\nand discusses composite jobs:\\nComposite jobs have significant elements of two or more occupations and\\nas such, have no counterpart in the DOT.\\n•The claimant’s PRW  may be a composite job if it takes multiple DOT\\noccupations to locate the main duties of the PRW  as described by the\\nclaimant.\\n•If you determine that PRW  was a composite job, you must explain\\nwhy.\\n•When comparing  the claimant’s RFC to a composite job as the\\nclaimant performed it, find the claimant capable of performing  the\\ncomposite job only  if he or she can perform all parts of the job.\\n•A composite job does not have a DOT counterpart, so do not evaluate\\nit at the part of step 4 considering  work “as generally  performed in the\\nnational economy .”\\n67\\n•At step 5 of sequential evaluatio n, a claimant may be able to use skills\\nhe or she gained from a skilled or semiski lled composite job to adjust\\nto other work. See Transferability  of Skills Assessment (TSA), DI\\n25015.017, for instructions on how to assess transferability  of skills.\\n12.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the impact of the claimant’s inability  to\\ntolerate stress on his/her abilit y to perform his/her past relevant highly\\nstressful work, as discussed in SSR 85-15 and SSR 24-2p. \\nApplicable law: SSR 24-2p provides that in determining  whether an\\nindivid ual is able to perform PRW , the ALJ may need to obtain detailed\\ninformation regarding  the work’s “mental demands, and other  job\\nrequirements” and the ALJ’s decision must consider the “mental demands of\\nthe PRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .”  \\nSSR 85-15 acknowledg es that “since mental illness is defined and\\ncharacteriz ed by maladaptive behavior, it is not unusual that the mentally\\nimpaired have difficulty  accomm odating to the demands of work and work-\\nlike setting s. Determining  whether these individuals will be able to adapt to\\nthe demands or “stress” of the workplace is often extremely  difficult.” The\\nruling  states it is “not intended to set out any presumptive limitations for\\ndisorders, but to emphasiz e the impor tance of thoroug hness in evaluation on\\nan individualiz ed basis.”  SSR 85-15 provides examples of how reactions to\\nthe demands of work stress can affect the ability  to perform PRW :\\nThe reaction to the demands of work (stress) is highly individualiz ed, and\\nmental  illness is characteriz ed by adverse responses to seeming ly trivial\\ncircumstances. The mentally  impaired may cease to functio n effectively\\nwhen facing  such demands as getting  to work regularly , having  their\\nperformance supervised, and remaining  in the workplace for a full day. A\\nperson may become panicked and develop palpitations, shortness of\\nbreath, or feel faint while riding  in an elevator; another may experie nce\\nterror and begin to hallucinate when approached by a strang er asking  a\\nquestion. Thus, the mentally  impaired may have difficulty  meetin g the\\nrequirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.\\nBecause response to the demands of work is highly individuali zed, the\\nskill level of a position is not necessarily  related to the difficulty  an\\nindividual will have in meeting  the demands of the job. A claimant’s\\ncondition may make performance of an unskilled job as difficult as an\\nobjectively  more demanding  job. For example, a busboy  need only  clear\\ndishes from tables. But an individual with a severe mental disorder may\\nfind unmanag eable the demands of making  sure that he removes all the\\ndishes, does not drop them, and gets the table  cleared promptly  for the\\nwaiter or waitress. Similarly , an individual who cannot tolerate being\\nsupervised may not be able to work even in the absence of close\\nsupervision; the knowledge  that one’s work is being  judg ed and evaluated,\\n68\\neven when the supervision is remote or indirect, can be intolerable for\\nsome mentally  impaired perso ns. Any impairment-related limitations\\ncreated by an individual’s response to demands of work, however, must be\\nreflected in the RF C assessment.\\nId. (emphasis in orig inal).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant has the RFC to perform  sedentary\\n[or light] work, his/her finding  that s/he is able to return to his/her past\\nrelevant work as a *** [state job], which is classified as light [or medium]\\nwork both as s/he performed it and as it was performed in the national\\neconomy , cannot be sustained.\\n14.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her  past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, conflicts with the AL J’s own RF C  finding s.\\n15.The ALJ erred in classify ing the claimant’s past releva nt work as a *** [state\\njob] as “light” [or “sedentary ”] work when it was, in fact, “medium” [or\\n“light” work] , both as he/she performed the work and as performed in the\\nnational economy  according  to the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-2p provi des that a claimant is considered “not\\ndisabled” who retains the RFC to perform either the actual functional\\ndemands and job duties of his/her particular past relevant job or the functional\\ndemands and job duties of the occupation as it is generally  required by\\nemploy ers throug hout the national economy .\\n16.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, directly  conflicts with the VE’s testimony , which the\\nALJ essentially  disreg arded in his/her decision.\\nH.STEP 5 - AB ILITY TO PERFORM OTHER WORK\\n1.As the claimant lacks any transferable skills, s/he cannot, in fact, perform\\nsemi-skilled work as a [ state job]  as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  Skills are acquired in a claimant’s past relevant work or in\\nrecent education that provides for direct entry into skilled work. SSR 00-4p. \\nThe Commissioner has specif ically determined that “unskilled work\\ncorresponds to an SVP of 1-2; semi-skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 3-\\n4; and skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 5-9 in the [Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles] ” and these “regulatory  definitions of skill levels are\\ncontrolling .” Id.\\nFurthermore, as set forth in Social Security  Ruing  83-10:\\nthe [ a]bility  to perform skilled or semiskilled work depends on the\\n69\\npresence of acquired skills which may  be transferred to such work from\\npast job ex perience above the unskilled level or the presence of recently\\ncompleted education which allows for direct entry  into skilled or\\nsemiskilled work . . . .\\nThis Ruling  further explains that in order to find that a claimant has\\ntransferable skills, the individual “must have performed work which is above\\nthe unskilled level of complex ity, must have identifiable skills, and must be\\nable to use these skills in specific skilled or semiskilled occupations within his\\nor her RF C.”\\nA claimant who cannot use his or her skills in other jobs  is considered to have\\nan unskilled work backg round.  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past\\nwork, we consider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them\\nin other skilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  And\\nif the claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n2.Since the ALJ determined that the claimant could perform semi-skilled work,\\nthe ALJ pursuant to SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14 must cite examples  of jobs\\nthat the claimant  could perform and the incidence of such jobs in the national\\neconomy .\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Ruling  83-11 provides that in those cases\\nwhere a claimant’s past relevant work included one or more skilled or semi-\\nskilled jobs and transferability of skills is material, the “finding  of fact\\nrequires identification of the work skills, examples of specific skilled or\\nsemiskilled occupations within the person’s RFC to which s/he or she can\\ntransfer skills (if any), and a statement of the incidence of such jobs in the\\nregion in which the person lives or in several regions of the country .”  Id.  The\\nALJ must ask the vocational witness to identify  examples of appropriate jobs\\nand to state the incidence of such  jobs in the national economy .  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1566, 416.966.  \\nSSR 83-14, applicable when a claimant has a combination of exertional and\\nnonex ertional impairments, provides that:\\n[w]henever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disabled, the determinatio n or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/job s the person can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.Since the testimony  of the VE supports a finding  that there is no work in the\\nnational economy  upon a proper consideration of all of the claimant’s\\nlimitations, the Appeals Council should award benefits.\\n70\\n4.The Appeals Council should find the claimant disabled based on the\\ntestimony  of the vocational ex pert.\\n5.The evidence of record documents that the claimant is disabled and unable to\\nperform the basic mental demands of unskilled work as described in SSR 85-\\n15, warranting  an award of benefits.\\nApplicable law : As set forth in SSR 85-15:\\nThe basic menta l demands of competitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry  out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supe rvision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations; and to deal with changes in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding  of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experien ce will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nExample 1:  A person whose vocational factors of age, education, and\\nwork experience would ordinarily  be considered favorable (i.e., very\\nyoung  age, unive rsity education, and highly skilled work experience)\\nwould have a severely limited occupational base if he or she has a mental\\nimpairment which causes a substantial loss of ability  to respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations.  A\\nfinding  of disability  would be appropriate.\\nSimilarly , SSR 96-9p states the following  regarding  the mental demands of\\nsedentary  work:\\nA substantial loss of ability  to meet any one of several basic work-related\\nactivities on a sustaine d basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or an\\nequivalent work schedule), will substantially  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and would justify a finding  of disability .  These mental\\nactiviti es are generally  required by competitive, remunerative, unskilled\\nwork:\\n•Understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n•Making  judgments that are commensurate with the functions of\\nunskilled work – i.e., simple work- related decisions.\\n•Responding  appropriately  to supervision, co-workers, and usual\\nwork situations.\\n•Dealing  with chang es in a routine work setting .\\nPOMS DI 25020.010, addressing  mental limitations, addresses “substantial\\n71\\nloss” as follows: \\n“Substantial loss” cannot be precisely  defined.  It does not necessarily\\nrelate to any particular adjective, number, or percent age.  In practical\\nterms, an individual has a substantial loss of ability  to perfo rm a basic\\nmental activity  when he or she cannot perform the particular activit y in\\nregular, competitive employ ment but, at best, could do so only in a\\nsheltered work setting  where special considerations and attentio n are\\nprovided. This requires professional judgment, on the basis of the\\nevidence in file in each case. The impairment in a claim of this type may\\nmeet or equal the listed medical criteria.  Therefore, before making  a\\ndetermination that includes vocational evaluation, the adjudicat or should\\ndiscuss the case with a psychiatrist or psycholog ist to learn whether a\\nsignificant part of the evidence had been previously  overlooked or\\nunderrated. . . .\\nEXCEP TION : In a few rare instances where a person’s vocatio nal\\nprofile is extrem ely adverse (e.g., closely  approaching  retiremen t age,\\nlimited education or less, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field\\nof unskilled  work that is now precluded by a mental impairment), a\\nfinding  of “disabled” may be appropri ate. (This would be adjudicated\\nunder the Lifetime Com mitments Special Medical-Vocational Profile. See\\nDI 25010.001B .3.).\\nId. (Emphasis in original).  See generally  the following  POMS addressing\\nmental impairments: DI 25015.020, 25020.001-25020.01 5, 25025.001, and\\n25025.030.\\n6.The ALJ erred in relying on the testimony  of a vocational expert which rebuts\\nthe finding  of disability directed by the Medical-Vocational Guidelines\\n(Grids).\\nApplicabl e law:  The Grids rules are conclusive and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted “rebuttable presumptions” of disability  that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10  directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was a\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational testimony  that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particula r individual’s\\nvocational factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disabled. However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\n72\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)). The Commissioner noted that since “there is\\nno provision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact\\nfor SSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations, “the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the direct ed conclusion of disability  was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.” Id.\\n7.The ALJ erred in relying on the VE’s testimony  that considered whether the\\nclaimant ’s need for [state limitation]  could be reasonably  accommodated by\\nemploy ers in deny ing this case.\\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court has held that the issue of reasonable\\naccommodation by employ ers is not relevant in a Social Security  case.

      "  \"text\": \"light of this ruling, the ALJ should not have considered whether the claimant's limitations could be accommodated in the workplace when determining disability status. The focus should remain solely on the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy, irrespective of potential accommodations.\\n\\n8. The ALJ failed to properly assess the cumulative impact of the claimant's impairments on their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-8p and SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-8p emphasizes the need for a comprehensive assessment of all impairments, both severe and non-severe, in determining a claimant's RFC. Similarly, SSR 85-15 highlights the importance of considering how mental impairments can affect an individual's ability to cope with the demands of work. The ALJ's failure to evaluate the combined effects of the claimant's impairments undermines the validity of the disability determination.\\n\\n9. The ALJ's decision lacks substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the claimant can perform other work in the national economy, given the limitations outlined in the record.\\n\\nApplicable law: The burden of proof lies with the ALJ to demonstrate that there are jobs available in the national economy that the claimant can perform, considering their RFC and limitations. If the evidence does not substantiate this conclusion, the claimant should be found disabled.\\n\\n10. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the vocational expert's testimony regarding the availability of jobs that accommodate the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: When a vocational expert provides testimony regarding job availability, the ALJ must consider this information in conjunction with the claimant's RFC and limitations. Ignoring this testimony can lead to an erroneous conclusion about the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy.\\n\\n11. The ALJ's reliance on the Grids to determine the claimant's disability status was inappropriate given the unique circumstances of the case.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Grids are designed to provide a framework for determining disability based on age, education, and work experience. However, if a claimant has non-exertional limitations that significantly impact their ability to work, the ALJ must consider additional evidence beyond the Grids to make a proper determination.\\n\\n12. The ALJ failed to adequately explain the rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and limitations, as required by SSR 16-3p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 16-3p mandates that an ALJ must provide a clear explanation for any discrepancies between a claimant's reported symptoms and the evidence in the record. A lack of thorough analysis can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's credibility and the severity of their impairments.\\n\\n13. The ALJ did not properly evaluate the medical opinions provided by the claimant's treating physician, which is contrary to the regulations set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527 and 416.927.\\n\\nApplicable law: Treating physicians' opinions are given significant weight in disability determinations, and the ALJ must provide specific reasons for any rejection of these opinions. Failure to do so can result in a flawed assessment of the claimant's RFC and overall disability status.\\n\\n14. The ALJ's decision to deny benefits is inconsistent with the medical evidence presented, which supports the claimant's allegations of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The ALJ must base their decision on substantial evidence, which includes medical records, expert opinions, and the claimant's testimony. If the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding of disability, the ALJ's denial of benefits may be legally challenged.\\n\\n15. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the impact of the claimant's mental health conditions on their ability to perform work-related activities, as outlined in SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 85-15 emphasizes the need for a thorough evaluation of how mental impairments can affect an individual's capacity to work. The ALJ's oversight in this area can lead to an incomplete understanding of the claimant's limitations and an erroneous conclusion regarding their disability status.\\n\\n16. The ALJ's finding that the claimant can perform light work is not supported by the evidence, given the claimant's documented physical limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Light work requires the ability to stand and walk for a significant portion of the workday. If the claimant's medical records indicate limitations that preclude such activities, the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform light work is not substantiated.\\n\\n17. The ALJ failed to adequately address the claimant's need for breaks and how this impacts their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-9p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-9p states that the need for frequent breaks can significantly erode the occupational base for sedentary work. The ALJ must consider this factor when determining the claimant's ability to work.\\n\\n18. The ALJ's decision lacks clarity regarding the specific jobs the claimant can perform, as required by SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14.\\n\\nApplicable law: When determining a claimant's ability to perform other work, the ALJ must identify specific job examples and their incidence in the national economy. A failure to provide this information can render the decision insufficiently supported.\\n\\n19. The ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform other work is undermined by the lack of vocational expert testimony addressing the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Vocational expert testimony is crucial in determining whether a claimant can perform other work in the national economy, especially when the claimant has unique limitations. The absence of such testimony can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's employability.\\n\\n20. The Appeals Council should remand the case for further consideration of the claimant's limitations and their impact on the ability to perform work, given the substantial evidence supporting the claim of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Appeals Council has the authority to remand cases for further evaluation when the evidence suggests that the ALJ's decision may not be supported by substantial evidence. A remand would allow for a more thorough examination of the claimant's limitations and their implications for work capacity.\"\n",

      "  \"context\": \"Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems, et al, 526 U.S. 795 (1999).16  In\\nCleveland , the Supreme Cour t addressed the question of whether an\\nindividual’s claim for, or receipt of, Social Security  disability  insurance\\nbenefits would preclude the individual from pursuing  a claim under the ADA. \\n526 U.S. at 797.  The Supreme Court held that:\\ndespite the appearance of confli ct that arises from the language of the two\\nstatutes, the two claims do not inherently  conflict to the point where courts\\nshould apply a special negative presumption like the one applied by the\\nCourt of Appeals here. This is because there are too many  situations in\\nwhich an SSDI  claim and an ADA claim can comfortably  exist side by\\nside.\\nId. at 802.  The Supreme Court noted that under the ADA, the issue is whether\\nan individual can perform the “essential functions” of a job “with reasonable\\naccommodation.”  Id. at 803.  In contr ast, the Court cited to a 1993\\nMemorandum from the Associate Commissioner for Hearing s and Appeals  in\\nnoting  that SSA does not take the possibility  of “reasonable accommodation”\\ninto account.  As such, an “ADA claim claiming  that the plaintiff can perform\\nher job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an\\nSSDI  claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs)\\nwithout it.”  Id. (Emphasis in original).  As adopted in Social Security  Ruling\\n00-1c:\\n \\n[W]hen the SSA determines whether an individual is disabled for SSDI\\npurposes, it does not take the possibility of “reasonable accommodation”\\ninto account,  nor need an applicant refer to the possibility  of reasonable\\naccommodation when she applies for SSDI . See Memorandum from\\nDaniel L. Skoler, Associate Comm’r for Hearing s and Appeals, SSA, to\\nAdministrative Appeals Judges, reprinted in 2 Social Security  Practice\\nGuide, App. § 15C[ 9], pp. 15-401 to 15-402 (1998).\\n16 This decision was adopted by SSA in Social Security Ruling 00-1c (Claims Filed Under Both the Social\\nSecurity Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act).\\n73\\nSSR 00-1c, Section I I (emphasis added).\\n8.The ALJ erred by not conducting  the heightened inquiry of the VE that is\\nrequired before relying on certain obsolet e occupations listed in EM-24027 to\\nfind a claimant “not disabled” at step 5 of the sequential evaluation process.\\nApplicable law:  EM-24027,17 Guidance Regarding the Citation of Certain\\nOccupations at Step Five of the Sequenti al Evaluation Process,  effective June\\n22, 2024, clarifies and consolidates guidance related to evidentiary  support\\nrequired before relying on certain obsol ete occupations to find a claimant “not\\ndisable d using the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt.\\nP, App. 2, as a framework for decision making .  It explains heightened\\nevident iary and articulation requirements about the Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Title s (DOT) occupations listed below, whose continued\\nwidespread existence multiple courts have questioned as to whether they\\ncontinue to be performed in the manner that they  are described in the DOT: \\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry\\nDesignation\\n209.587-010 Addresser clerical\\n249.587-018 Document Preparer,\\nMicrofilmingbusiness services\\n249.587-014 Cutter-and-Paster, Press\\nClipping sbusiness services\\n239.687-014 Tube Operator clerical\\n318.687-018 Silver W rapper hotel and restaurant\\n349.667-010 Host/Hostess, Dance Hall amusement and recreation\\n349.667-014 Host/Hostess, Head amusement and recreation\\n379.367-010 Surveillance-Sy stem Monitor government services\\n521.687-010 Almond B lancher, Hand canning  and preserving\\n521-687-086 Nut Sorter canning  and preserving\\n726.685-010 Magnetic-Tape W inder recording\\n782.687-030 Puller-Throug h glove and mitten\\n976.385-010 Microfilm Processor business services\\nAlternatively , adjudicator s may support the determination or decision with\\nother occupation(s) appropriate to the facts of the claim. This approach may\\n17EM-24027 m ay be accessed at: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/06212024022159PM\\n74\\nbe the most efficient way to ensure our burden at step five of the sequential\\nevaluation process is met and that the record contains the necessary  evidence\\nto support the “not disabled” finding . \\nThe EM explains that under SSR 00-4p, when there is an appare nt conflict\\nbetween vocational expert/specialist evidence and information in the DOT,\\nthe adjudicator must elicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict and\\nexplain in the determination how the conflict is resolved.  To ensure that\\nSSA’s decisions are adequately  supporte d and consistent with SSR 00-4p, this\\nEM clarifies the evidence needed to resolve these potential conflicts and\\nsupport a finding  of “not disabled” with respect to the listed occupations.\\nEM-24027 provides that an adjudicator  may not cite any of the DOT\\noccupations listed to support a framework “not disabled” determination\\nwithout additiona l evidence from a VS or VE supporting  the adjudicator’s\\nconclusion that, as the occupation is currently  performed:\\n•Its requirements are consistent with the individual’s RF C, and\\n•It exists in the national economy  in numbers that alone, or in combination\\nwith work in other cited occupations, are sig nificant.\\nThe determination must include or summariz e the VS or VE’s evidence that\\nsupports such a conclusion. This requirement applies if the adjudicato r intends\\nto rely on any of the listed occupations as support for a framework finding  of\\n“not disabled.”  \\n9.The ALJ erred in finding  claimant not disabled based on the ability  to perform\\njobs listed in the DOT which SSA has determined to be “isolated”\\noccupations which cannot be used to support a “not disabled” finding  at step 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process.\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Emerg ency  Messag e 2402618 - Isolated\\nOccupations We Will Not Use to Support a “Not Disabled” Finding at Step\\nFive of the Sequential Evaluation Process,  effective June 22, 2024, identif ies\\n114 DOT occupations which satisfy  the regulatory  defin ition of “isolated”\\noccupations in all regions of the country  that may not be cited at step 5 of the\\nsequential evaluation process to support a “not disabl ed” determination or\\ndecision that uses the Medical-Vocational Guideli nes, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 2, as a framework  for decision making . See EM-24026\\ndiscussed at page xxvi, supra .  “Isolated” occupations are occupations with\\njobs that “exist only in very limited numbers in relatively  few locations\\noutside of the region where [the individual lives] ,”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1566(b),\\n416.966(b). \\nUnder 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1566, 416.966, when SSA makes a determination or\\n18EM- 24026 m ay be accessed at: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/06212024021759PM\\n75\\ndecisio n at step five of the sequential evaluation, SSA will not deny  disability\\nbenefits based on the existence of “isolated jobs.”  EM-24026 states  that it is\\nnot applicable to the consideration of past relevant work at step 4 of the\\nsequential evaluation process and adjudica tors may continue to rely on\\n“isolated jobs” at step 4.  \\nI.   STEP 5 - T HE VOCATIONAL FACT OR OF EDUCAT ION\\n1.The ALJ erred  in finding  that the claimant has the ability  to do semi-skilled\\nthroug h skilled work solely  on the basis of having  a high school education and\\nabove, without considering  evidence of his/her actual educati onal abilities,\\nsuch as past relevant work experience, the kind of responsibility  an individual\\nmay have had when working , daily  activities, hobbies, results of testing ,\\ncommunity  projects, or vocational training .    \\n2.The ALJ erred in not considering  evidence presented by claimant regarding\\nreceipt of special education as a factor in determining  claimant’s  education\\ncateg ory.\\nApplicable law.  Education is defined as “formal schooling  or other training\\nwhich contributes” to the claimant’s ability  to meet the vocational\\nrequirements of work, such as reasoning  ability , communication skills, and\\narithmetical ability.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(a), 416.964(a).  The regulations\\nfurther state:  \\nHowever, if you do not have forma l schooling , this does not necessarily\\nmean that you are uneducated or lack these abilities.  Past work\\nexperience and the kinds of responsibilities you had when you were\\nworking  may show that you have intellectual abilities, althoug h you may\\nhave little formal education. Your daily activities, hobbies, or the results\\nof testing may also show that you have significant intellectual ability  that\\ncan be used to work.\\nThe importance of education may depend on “how  much time has passed\\nbetween the completion of your educational education and the beginning\\nof your physical or ment al impairment(s) and by what you have done with\\nyour education in a work or other setting .”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b),\\n416.964(b).  \\n“Formal education that you completed many years before your\\nimpairment began, or unused skills and knowl edge that were a part of\\nyour formal education, may no longer be useful or meaning ful in terms of\\nyour ability to work.”  Thus, the numerical grade level may not represe nt\\nthe claimant’s  “actual educational abilities,” which may be higher or\\nlower.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b). In cases where “there is no\\nother evidence to contradict it,” SSA will use the claimant’s numerical\\ngrade level to determine educational abilities.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b),\\n76\\n416.964(b). \\nThe regulations set forth four categ ories used to assess a claima nt’s education\\nlevel.  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b); SSR 20-01p. \\nIlliteracy  – defined as “the inability  to read or write” even simple\\nmessag es such as  instructions or inven tory lists even thoug h the person\\ncan sign his or her name. The individual must be unable to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.  “Generally  an illiterate person has little or no formal\\nschooling .” \\nMargin al education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nneeded for simple, unskilled jobs.  “We generally  consider that formal\\nschooling  at a 6th grade level of formal education or less is a marg inal\\neducation.”\\nLimited education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nabilities but  not enough  for “most of the more complex  job duties needed\\nin semi-s killed or skilled jobs.”  “We generally  consider that a 7th grade\\nthroug h 11th grade level of formal education is a limited  education.”\\nHigh school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic,\\nand language skills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level\\nor above” which  generally  permits performanc e of  semi-skilled throug h\\nskilled work.\\nSee also SSR 20-01p (also addressing  the four categ ories of education).\\n  SSR 20-01p also notes that form al schooling  is the primary , but not ex clusive,\\nindicator of education level.  Ordinari ly, the highest grade completed will be\\nused to categ orize the individual’s education, regardless of the language use\\nfor instruction.  This  is not, however, the only way to determine education\\nlevel.  As noted in SSR 20-01p:\\nThe highest numerical grade level that the individual complet ed in school,\\nhowever, may not represent his or her actual educational abilities.\\nEvidence such as past work experience, the kind of responsibility  an\\nindividual may have had when working , daily  activities, hobbies, results\\nof testing , community  projects, or vocational training, may show that an\\nindividual’s actual educational abilities are higher or lower than his or her\\nformal education level.  In such situations, we may assig n an individual to\\na hig her or lower education categ ory, as appropriate.\\nPursuant to SSR 20-01p, an individual who lacks formal schooling  may\\nstill be considered educated because other evidence “may  show that the\\nindivi dual has significant intellectual ability  that can be used to work.” \\nFormal schooling  may also indic ate a level of education higher than that\\nactually  posse ssed, as determined throug h other evidence.  In either case,\\n77\\nrelevant evidence may inclu de such thing s as “past work experience, the\\nkind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily\\nactivities, hobbies, results of testing, community  projects,” and vocational\\ntraining . \\nA history  of special education can show that a person’s educational\\nabilities are lower than the grade completed.  SSR 20-01p states that the\\nnature of an individual’s formal schooling  itself is also a potentially\\nimportant consideration.  The Ruling  notes the releva nce of an extensive\\nhistory  of special educa tion, which can show that the individual’s\\neducati onal abilities are lower than the grade completed. While there is no\\nautomatic rule with respect to special education, in a particular case it may\\nmake the difference in determining  education level. \\nSSR 20-01p explains that when determining  education level with regard to\\nformal schooling , it does not matter whether the instruct ion was in English\\nor some other language. SSA “will not consider whethe r an individual\\nattained his or her education in another country or whether the individual\\nlacks English language proficiency .”  These circumstances are not\\nrelevant to “whether the individual ’s reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nabilities are commensurate with his or her formal education level.” \\nFinally , SSR 20-01p provides that “[i]n all cases, we determine facts on an\\nindividual basis. Therefore, to assig n an individual to an education\\ncateg ory lower or higher than his or her highest level of formal education,\\nthere must be specific evidence supporting  the finding  in the\\ndetermination or decision.”\\n   \\n3.The ALJ erred in not finding  that the claimant has a marg inal education and is\\ndisabled in accordance with Rule 203.01, applicable to individual who can\\nperform medium work.\\n \\nApplicable law:  Rule 203.01 directs a finding  of disability  for an individual\\nwho can perform medium work, is closely approaching  advanced age (age 50-\\n54), has a marg inal education or is illiterate and has unskilled or no work\\nexperience.  The regulations set forth four categ ories used to asses s a\\nclaim ant’s education level.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b); SSR 20-\\n01p. [1] The difference between a marg inal education and limited education is\\nas follows:  \\n \\nMarginal education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nneeded for simple, unskilled jobs.  “We generally  consider that formal\\nschooling at a 6th grade level of formal education or less is a marg inal\\neducation.”\\nLimited education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nabilities but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job duties needed\\nin semi-skille d or skilled jobs.”  “We generally  consider that a 7th grade\\n78\\nthroug h 11th grade level of formal education is a limited education.”\\n \\nSSR 20-01p notes that forma l schooling  is the primary , but not exclusive,\\nindicator of education level.  Ordinarily , the highest grade completed will be\\nused to categ orize the individual’s education.  This is not, however, the only\\nway to determine education level.  Pursuant to SSR 20-01p, an individual who\\nlacks formal schooling  may still be considered educated because other\\nevidence “may show that the individual has significant intellectual ability  that\\ncan be used to work.”  Formal schooling  may also indicate a level of\\neducatio n higher than that actually  possessed, as determined throug h other\\nevidence.  In either case, relevant evidence may include such thing s as “past\\nwork experience, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when\\nworking , daily  activities, hobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and\\nvocational training . \\n \\nMoreover, as set forth in SSR 20-1p, a history  of special education can show\\nthat a person’s education al abilities are lower than the grade completed.  SSR\\n20-01p states that the nature of an individual’s formal schooling  itself is also a\\npotenti ally important consideration.  The Ruling  notes the relevance of an\\nextensive history  of special education, which can show that the individual’s\\neducational abilities are lower than the grade completed. While there is no\\nautomatic rule with respect to special education, in a particular case it may\\nmake the difference in determining  education level.\\n4.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant  has a limited education when, in\\nfact, he has a marg inal education and meets all of the requirements as a\\n“Worn Out W orker.”\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-1p seeks to ensure effectuation of the regulatory\\nprovisions presently  contained in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1562, 416.962.  Pursuant\\nto the policy  embodied therein, a claimant with a marg inal education and\\nwork experience consisting  only of 35 or more years of arduous physical labor\\nis ordinarily  disabled so long as an impairment prevents return to the\\nclaimant’s usual level of work.  Therefore, this policy  must be consulted at\\nstep 4, before the Grids are applied, as a different result may otherwise be\\ndirected for individuals who have not y et attained the ag e of 60.\\n5.The ALJ erred in apply ing a Grid rule that applies to  individuals who have a\\nhigh school education or more with “direct entry  into skilled work” as the\\nevidence documents that the claimant has a remote education.    \\n6.The ALJ committed reversible error in applying Grid Rule 201.05 [or Rule\\n201.08, 210.13, 201.16, 202.05, 202.08]  as there is no evidence of record  to\\nsupport a finding  that the claimant has a high school education which provides\\nfor direct entry  into skilled work.\\nApplicable law:  Each of the cited Grid Rules applies when a claimant is a\\nhigh school graduate or more which “provides for direct entry into skilled\\nwork,” and has no transferable skills.  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, §\\n79\\n201.08, 210.13, 201.16, 202.05, 202.08.  The preamble to the Grids further\\nexplains that:\\n(d) The adversity  of functional restrictions to sedentary  work at advanced\\nage (55 and over) for individuals with no relevant past work or who can\\nno longer perform vocationally  relevant past work and have no\\ntransferable skills, warrants a finding of disabled in the absence of the\\nrare situation where the individual has recently completed education\\nwhich provides a basis for direct entry into skilled sedentary work. \\nAdvanced age and a histo ry of unskilled work or no work experience\\nwould ordinarily  offset any vocational advantag es that might accrue by\\nreason of any remote past education, whether it is more or less than\\nlimited education.\\nId. at § 201.00(d) (emphasis added).\\n7.The ALJ erred in not considering the claimant’s illiteracy  and that s/he is\\ndisabled in accordance with Vocational Rules 201.17 and/or 202.09.\\n \\n8.The ALJ erred in finding  claimant literate solely  on the basis of having\\ncompleted the fourth grade or more, despite evidence demonstrating  an\\ninability  to read or write a simple messag e in any  lang uage.\\nApplicable law:  Illiteracy  is defined as “the inability  to read or write.” 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1564((b)(1), 416.964(b)(1). The reg ulations further provide:\\n \\nWe consider someone illiterat e if the person cannot read or write a simple\\nmessag e such as instructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can\\nsign his or her name.  Generally , an illiterate person has had little or no\\nformal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p, effective April 27, 2020, makes clear that illiterate does not\\nmean unable to read or write in English and that a person who cannot\\ncommunicate in English may still be considered literate. SSR 20-01p explains\\nthat SSA will assign an individual to the illiteracy  categ ory only if the\\nindividual is unable to read or write a simple messag e in any language,”\\n(emphasis supplied) noting  that most individuals learn to read and write  at\\nleast a simple messag e by the time they complete fourth grade, regardless of\\nwhether the schooling  occurred in the United States or in another country . \\nGenerally , claimants who have completed the fourth grade or more are not\\nilliterate.  However, SSR 01p ex plains:\\n \\nWe may still find, however, that an individual with at least a fourth grade\\neducation is illiterate if the individual provides evidence showing  that\\ndespite having  completed fourth grade or more, he or she cannot, in fact,\\nread or write a simple messag e in any languag e. Examples of relevant\\nevidence may  include whether an individual: \\n80\\n • has received long -term special education related to difficulty learning\\nto read or write at a basic level;\\n •  lacks work history  due to an inability  to read or write;\\n • has valid intelligence test results demonstrating  an inability  to read or\\nwrite a simple messag e, or has valid reading  and writing  test results\\ndemonstrating  an inability  to read or write a simple messag e, althoug h\\ntest results alone will not be relied on to determine that illiteracy  is the\\nappropriate education categ ory for an individual; and\\n • has any other evidence demonstrating an inability  to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.”\\n \\nSSR 20-01p also states that SSA will not “make any general finding  that\\nilliteracy  is the appropriate category for individuals who have not completed a\\nfourth grade education.”  In such circumstances, SSA will “consider all\\nrelevant evidence in the claim to determine whether illiteracy  is the\\nappropriate education categ ory.” SSA uses evidence which may include\\nwhether the individual: \\n \\n• “has worked in the past and the responsibilities he or she had when \\nworking ”;\\n \\n•“can read, write, and understand short and simple statements in every\\nday life, such as shopping  lists, short notes,”;\\n \\n• “can read newspapers or books”;\\n \\n• “can write emails or tex t messag es”;\\n \\n• “had any  vocational training  or certifications requiring  reading  and\\n    writing ”;\\n \\n•“has or ever had a driver’s licenses that required passing  a written\\ntest”;  and\\n • “has any  other evidence demonstrating  an inability  to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.”\\nJ.    STEP 5 – T HE VOCATIONAL FACT OR OF AGE\\n1.The ALJ committed reversib le error in mechanically  apply ing the age criteria\\nof the Grids as the claimant was within a few months of turning  age 50 [or age\\n55 or ag e 60]  when the AL J issued his/her decision.\\n2.The ALJ committed reversible error in mechanically  apply ing the age\\ncateg ory of the Grids due to the claimant’s borderline ag e.\\n81\\nApplicabl e law:  The regulations provide that the age criteria of the Medical-\\nVocational Guidelines are not to be mechanically  applied in borderline\\nsituations:\\nWe will not apply  the age categories mechanically  in a borderline\\nsituation.  If you are within a few days to a few months of reaching  an\\nolder age categ ory, and using  the older age category would result in a\\ndetermination or decision that you are disabled, we will consider whether\\nto use the older age category after evaluating the overall impact of all the\\nfactors of y our case.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1563(b), 416.963(b). HAL LEX § I-2-2-42 indicates that an\\nadjudicator should apply  a two-part test for ident ifying borderline age\\nsituations.  First, the adjudicator should determine if the claimant’s age is\\nwithin a few days or a few months of the next highest age categ ory, and if so,\\nshould then determine whether using  the next higher age categ ory results in a\\ndecision of “disabled,” instead of “not disabled.”  HALLEX § I-2-2-42(B ). \\n“If the answer to both parts of the test is ‘yes,’ a borderline age situation\\nexists, and the ALJ must decide whether it is more appropriate  to use the\\nclaimant’s chronolog ical age or the higher age categ ory.” Id. (Emphasis\\nadded).  “Generally , SSA considers a few days to a few months to mean a\\nperiod not to exceed six months.” HAL LEX § I-2-2-42(B )(1).  In cases where\\n“using  the higher age categ ory does affect the outcome of the decision, a\\nborderline age situation does exist,” and the ALJ will use the procedures\\noutlined in HAL LEX I-2-2-42 C below.”  Id.\\nFor additional g uidance, see also  POMS DI  25015.006, B orderline Ag e.\\nK.STEP 5 – T HE MEDICAL -VOCATIONAL RULES (GRIDS)\\n1.Even thoug h the claimant’s exertional level fell between two levels of the\\nGrids which direct opposite conclusions, the ALJ committed reversible error\\nin not apply ing the lower rule which directs a finding  of disability .\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in cases “where an individual\\nhas an impairment or combination of impairments resulting  in both streng th\\nlimita tions and nonex ertional limitations,” the Grid rules “are considered in\\ndetermining  first whether a finding  of disabled may be possible based on the\\nstreng th limitations alone . . . .”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subp t. P, App. 2\\n(hereinafter “Grids”) § 200.00(e)(2). Social Securi ty Ruling  83-12 addresses\\nthe situation where the “exertional level falls between two rules which direct\\nopposite conclusions, i.e., ‘Not disabled’  at the higher exertional level and\\n‘Disabled’ at the lower ex ertional level . . . .”  This Ruling  provides:\\nAn exertiona l capacity  that is only slightly reduced in terms of the\\nregulatory  criteria could indicate a sufficient remaining  occupational base\\nto satisfy  the minimal requirements for a finding  of ‘Not disabled.’\\n82\\nOn the other hand, if the exertional capacity is significantly reduced in\\nterms of the regulatory definition, it could indicat e little more than the\\noccupational base for the lower rule and could justify a finding of\\n“Disabled.”\\nIn situations where the rules would direct different conclusions, and the\\nindividual’s exertional limitations  are somewhere ‘in the middle’ in terms\\nof the regulatory  criteria for exertional rang es of work, more difficult\\njudg ments are involved as to the sufficienc y of the remaining  occupational\\nbase to support a conclusion as to disability . According ly, VS assistance is\\nadvisable for these ty pes of cases.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n2.The ALJ erred by not apply ing the Grid rule applicable to an individual who\\nhas an unskilled work history  given his/her lack of transferable skills, and by\\nnot finding  him/her disabled in accordance with Rule 201.09 and/or Rule\\n201.17 and/or Rule 202.09 of the Grids.\\nApplicable law:  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past work, we\\nconsider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them in other\\nskilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.965(a).  And if\\nthe claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n \\nIn 2003, SSA proposed reg ulatory  amendments to:\\nensure that our regulations clearly  reflect our long standing  policy  that, if\\nyou have skilled or semiskilled work experience, but you cannot use your\\nskills in other work  (i.e., your skills are not transferable to other work),\\nyour ability  to adjust to other work is no greater than it would be if you\\nhad only  unskilled work ex perience.\\n68 Fed. Reg. 40213 (July 7, 2003).19 As SSA has explained, the regulations\\ncurrently  provide that “if your skills cannot be transferred to other work\\nwithin your RFC, we consider you to be no better off than if you have only\\nunskilled work experience” and in cases where all of the other vocational\\nfactors are the same, “we will make the same decision if you have work skills\\nthat do not transfer to other work, as we will for a person who has unskilled\\nwork experience.” 68 Fed. Reg. at 40215 (citing  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a),\\n416.965(a)).  One of the proposed chang es was to Rules 201.17, 201.19, and\\n202.09 and to clarify  that these rules applied “if you have unskilled or no\\nwork experience, or if you have a skilled or semiskilled work  experience with\\nno transferable skills.” 20 F ed. Reg . at 40215.\\n19 This  proposed rule was never finalized.\\n83\\n3.The ALJ committed reversible error in relying on vocational expert testimony\\nas it conflicted with the Grids.\\nApplicable law:  The Grids are conclusiv e and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted a “rebuttable presumption” of disability that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10 directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational expert that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particular individual’s\\nvocati onal factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disable d.  However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)).  SSA has noted that since “there is no\\nprovision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact for\\nSSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations,” the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the directed conclusion of disabili ty was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ committ ed reversible error by not obtaining  vocational expert\\ntestimony  in lig ht of the claimant’s need for an assistive device.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in Social Security  96-9p, to perform the full\\nrange of sedentary  work, a claiman t must be able to walk and stand for a total\\nof “no more than about 2 hours of an 8-hour workday .”  This Ruling goes on\\nto state that an individual who cannot stand and walk for two hours a day\\ncannot perform the full range of sedentary  work.  Id.  SSR 96-9p further notes\\nthat “the occupational base for an individual who must use [an assistive]\\ndevice for balance because of significant involvem ent of both lower\\nextremities (e.g., becaus e of a neurolog ical impairment) may be significantly\\neroded.”  Id.  “In these situations, too, it may be especially  useful to consult a\\nvocational resource in order to make a judgment regarding the individual’s\\nability  to make an adjustment to other work.”  Id. See also POMS DI\\n25015.020(B )(6) (addre ssing “Medically  required hand-held assistive\\ndevice”).\\n 5.The ALJ erred by not obtain ing vocational expert testimony  in light of the\\nclaimant’s manipulative limitations.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  85-15 provides that reachi ng\\n(extending  the hands and arms in any direction) and handling  (seiz ing,\\n84\\nholding , grasping , turning  or otherwise working  primarily  with the whole\\nhand or hands) are activities required in almost all jobs.  Sign ificant\\nlimitations of reaching  or handling  may eliminate a large number of\\noccupatio ns a person could otherwise do. Vary ing degrees of limitations\\nwould have different effects, and a vocational expert’s assistance may be\\nneeded to determine the effects of the limitations.  Id.\\nAs set forth in SSR 83-10, lig ht work entails the “use of arms and hands to\\ngrasp and to hold and turn objects” and “[m]ost unskilled sedentary  jobs\\nrequire good use of the hands and fingers for repetitive hand-fi nger\\nactions .”  Id.  Moreover, “[m]ost unskilled sedentary  jobs require good use\\nof both hands and the fingers; i.e., bilateral manual dexterity .”  SSR 96-\\n9p.  More over, “[a]ny significant manipulative limitation of an\\nindividual’s ability  to handle and work with small objects with both hands\\nwill result in a significant erosion of the unskilled sedentary  occupational\\nbase.”  Id.\\n6.In light of the claimant’s limited use of his/her dominant upper extremity ,\\nvocational testimony  was needed.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 83-12, Special Situations, No. 2 provides:\\nLoss of Use of an Upper Extremity\\nA person who has lost the use of an arm or hand beca use of amputation,\\nparaly sis, etc., obviously  cannot perform jobs which require use of both\\narms or both hands.  Loss of major use of an upper extremity  is rather\\ndefinitive in that there is a considerable absence of functional ability  . . ..\\nExperience with persons who have lost the use of an upper extremity  has\\nshown that their potential occupational base is between the occupational\\nbases for Table No. 1 (sedentar y work) and Table No. 2 (light work). \\nWhile individuals with this impairment have been known to perform\\nselected occupations at nearly  all exertional levels, the total number  of\\noccupations within their RFC’s is less than the number represented by a\\nfull or wide range of light work.  These individuals would generall y not be\\nexpected to perfor m sedentary  work because most unskilled sedentary\\njobs require good use of both hands. Persons who have the least remaining\\nfunction would have only the lower occupational base, while those who\\nhave the most remaining  function would have some of the higher\\noccupational base added in terms of numbers of jobs which can be\\nperformed with this type of impairment.  Given an individual’s particular\\nRFC, a VS will be able to determine the size of the remaining\\noccupational base, cite specific jobs within the individu al’s RFC, and\\nprovide a statement of the incidence of those jobs in the region of the\\nindividual’s residence or in several reg ions of the country .\\n7.Given the fact that the claimant cannot lift 10 pounds, which is a significant\\nlimitation of the occupational base, vocational ex pert testimony  was needed.\\n85\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 96-9p, “[l]ifting/carry ing and\\npushing /pulling : If an individual is unable to lift 10 pounds or occasio nally lift\\nand carry  items like docket files, ledgers, and small tools throug hout the\\nworkday , the unskilled sedentary  occupational base will be eroded.”\\n8.Vocational expert testimony  was needed in light of the claimant’s\\nenvironmental restrictions.\\nApplicable law : As noted in Social Security  Ruling  85-15:\\nWhere a person has a medica l restriction to avoid excessive amounts of\\nnoise, dust, etc., the impact on the broad world of work would be minimal\\nbecause most job environments do not involve great noise, amounts of\\ndust, etc.\\nWhere an individual can tolerate very little noise, dust, etc., the impact on\\nthe ability to work would be considerable because very few job\\nenvironments are entirely free of irritants, pollutants, and other\\npotentially damaging conditions .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n9.In light of the presence of significant nonex ertional limitations of *** [state\\nlimitations]  that affect the claimant’s occupational base, the ALJ erred by not\\nobtaining  vocational expert testimony .\\n10.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant suffe rs from a severe mental \\nimpairment and that, as a result, s/he is limited to simple, repetitive tasks,\\nvocational expert testimony  was required.\\nApplicable law: The regulations at 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a(c)(1),\\n416.969a(c)(1) set forth  the following  examples of nonex ertional limitations\\nor restrictions:\\n  \\n(i)You have difficulty  functioning  because you are nervous, anxious, or\\ndepressed;\\n(ii)You have difficulty  maintaining  attention or concentrating ;\\n(iii)You have difficulty  understandi ng or remembering  detailed instruc-    \\ntions;\\n(iv) You have difficulty  in seeing  or hearing ;\\n(v)You have difficulty  tolerating  some  physical feature(s) of certain work\\nsetting s, e.g ., you cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or\\n(vi)You have diffic ulty performing  the manipulative or postural functions\\nof some work such as reaching , handling , stooping , climbing ,\\ncrawling , or crouching .\\nSocial Security  Ruling  83-10 also discusses nonex ertional limitations and\\nprovides:\\n86\\nNonexertional Impairme nt.  Any impairment which does not directly\\naffect the ability to sit, stand, walk, lift, carry , push, or pull. This includes\\nimpairments which affect the mind, vision, hearing , speech, and use of the\\nbody  to climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, reach, handle, and use\\nof the fing ers for fine activities.\\nAs ex plained in the preamble to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines:\\nSince the rules are predicated on an individual’s having  an impairment\\nwhich mani fests itself by limitations in meeting  the streng th requirements\\nof jobs, they may not be fully  applicable where the nature of an\\nindividual’s impai rment does not result in such limitations, e.g., certain\\nmental, sensory, or skin impairments.  In addition, some impairments may\\nresult solely  in postural and manipulative limitations or environmental\\nrestrictions.\\n20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e).  The preamble  goes on to\\nstate that the “rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not\\ndisabled for individuals with solely  nonex ertional types of impairments.”   20\\nC.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e)(1). Further, if a claimant has “an\\nimpairment or combi nation of impairments resulting  in both streng th\\nlimitations and nonex ertional limitations,” the preamble states the following :\\nthe rules in this subpart are considered in determining  first whether a\\nfinding  of disabled may be possible based on the streng th limitations alone\\nand, if not, the rule(s) reflecting  the individual’s maximum residual\\nstreng th capabilities, age, education, and work  experience provide a\\nframework for consideration of how much the individual’s work\\ncapability  is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be\\ncontraindicated by the nonex ertional limitations.  Also, in these\\ncombinations of nonex ertional and exertional limitations which cannot be\\nwholly  determined under the rules in this Appendix  2, full consideration\\nmust be given to all of the relevant facts in the case in acco rdance with the\\ndefinitions and discuss ions of each factor in the appropriate sections of the\\nregulations, which will provide insig ht into the adjudicative weig ht to be\\naccorded each factor.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e)(2).\\n11.Even accepting  the ALJ’s finding  that the claima nt was limited to “simple\\ntasks,” vocational testimony  was needed.\\nApplicable law:  An ALJ’s finding  that “all the jobs encompassed by the\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines are unskilled jobs involving  only simple\\ntasks” is not an accurate statement.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a, 416.969a lists\\nthe following  examples of nonexertional limitations:\\n(c) Nonex ertional limitations.\\n87\\n(1) When the limitations and restrictions imposed by your impairment(s)\\nand related symptoms, such as pain, affect only your ability  to meet the\\ndemands of jobs other than the streng th demands, we consider that you\\nhave only nonex ertional limitations or restrictions.   Some examples of\\nnonex ertional limitations or restrictions include the following :\\n(i)You have difficulty  functioning  because you are nervous, anxious,\\nor depressed;\\n(ii)You have difficulty  maintaining  attention or concentrating ;\\n(iii) You have difficulty  understanding  or remembering  detailed            \\n     instructions;\\n(iv) You have difficulty  in seeing  or hearing ;\\n(v)You have difficulty  tolerating  some physical feature(s) of certain\\nwork setting s, e.g ., you cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or\\n(vi)You have difficulty  performing  the manipulative or postural\\nfunctions of some work such as reaching , handling, stooping ,\\nclimbing , crawling , or crouching .\\nId. The ALJ’s limitation of “simple tasks, ” by definition, means that the\\nclaimant has “difficulty  understanding  or remembering  detailed\\ninstructions,” such that vocational expert testimony  is needed.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1569a(c)(1)(iii), 416.969a(c)(1)(iii).\\nThe Dictionary of Occupati onal Titles (DOT)  discusses these types of\\nlimitations as the “reasoning ” function of a job.  See DOT, Appendix  C. \\nThis is part of the General Educational Development (“GED”) of jobs,\\nwhich “embraces those aspects of educ ation (formal and informal) which\\nare required of the worker for satisfactory  job performance.” According  to\\nthe DOT, reasoning  level “1” jobs can be performed by an individual who\\ncan understand and carry out “simple” instructions; level “2” jobs can be\\nperformed by an individual who can understand and carry  out “detailed\\nbut uninvolved written  or oral instructions;” and level “3” jobs entail even\\ngreater abilities.20  Id.  Furthermore, as set forth in the DOT, unski lled jobs\\neither have reason ing levels of 1, 2 or 3, depending  on the job.  For\\nexample,  the unskilled sedentary  job of a surveillance system monitor has\\n20 Reasoning scales range from a low of “1” to a high of “6,”  with levels 1 to 3 de fined as follows: \\nLEVEL 3: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out instructions furnished in written, oral,\\nor diagrammatic form. Deal with problems involving several concrete variables in or from\\nstandardized situations.\\nLEVEL 2: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out detailed but uninvolved written or oral\\ninstructions. Deal with problems involving a few concrete variables in or from standardized\\nsituations.\\nLEVEL 1: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out simple one- or two-step instructions.\\nDeal with standardized situations with occasional or no variables in or from these situations\\nencountered on the job.\\nDOT, Appendi x C.\\n88\\na reasoning  level of “3,” which requires much greater ability than the\\nability  to carry  out simple instructions.  An ALJ’s finding  that a claimant\\nis limited to work which entails “simple tasks” requires the testimony of a\\nvocational expert to determine what jobs could be performed by an\\nindividual with this specific limitation.\\n12.The claimant’s need for limited public contact is a significant nonex ertional\\nlimitation which required consideration by  a vocational ex pert.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-14 recog nizes that limited public contact is a\\nsignificant restriction which may well impact one’s ability  to perform\\nunskilled work.  This Ruling  discusses dealing  with the public and provides:\\nMenta l activities are also nonex ertional. Jobs at various levels of\\ncomplex ity require mental functions such as intellectual competence and\\nability  to function in terms of behavior, affect, thought, memory ,\\norientation and contac t with reality .  Exposure to particular work stresses\\nmay not be medically  sustainable for some persons with mental\\nimpairments, as would be the case with some persons who have physical\\nimpairments (e.g., certain cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disorders). \\nDepending  on the nature and extent of a person’s mental impairment\\nwhich does not meet or equal the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments,\\nrelativ ely broad or narrow types of work may be precluded (e.g., dealing\\nwith a variety of abstract and concrete variables with\\nnonverbal–sy mbolism--a highly skilled level of work--or dealing\\nfrequently with members of the public--a particular type of work at any\\nlevel of complexity ). Althoug h ment al impairments such as considered to\\nbe nonex ertional, some conditions (e.g., depression or a conversion\\nreaction) may  also affect a person’s ex ertional capacity .\\nId. (emphasis added).  \\nAdditionally , SSR 85-15 provides specific examples of nonex ertional\\nlimitations which impact the occupational base.  One ex ample cited is:\\nExample 3:  Someone who is closely  approaching retirement age, has a\\nlimited education or less, worked for 30 years in a cafeteria doing an\\nunskilled job as a “server,” almost constantly  dealing  with the public, and\\nnow cannot, because of a severe mental impairment, frequently deal  with\\nthe public.  In light of the narrowed voca tional opportunity  in conjunction\\nwith the person’s age, education, lack of skills, and long commitment to\\nthe particular ty pe of work, a finding  of disabled would be appropriate. . . .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant was limited to a “low-stress” job,\\ns/he erred by  not obtaining  the testimony  of a VE.\\n89\\n14.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant suffers from a severe mental\\nimpairment of *** [list impairment(s)]  and that s/he is limited to work with\\n“low stress demands,” vocational ex pert testimony  was required.\\nApplicable law: SSR 85-15 recog nizes that “the mentally  impaired may have\\ndifficulty  meeting  the requirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.”\\n15.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant requires a sit/stand option, a\\nlimitation which by itself affects the occupational base, vocational expert\\ntestimony  was required.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 83-12, “[u]nskilled types of jobs are\\nparticularly  structured so that a person cannot ordinarily  sit or stand at will.” \\nA sit/stand limitation affects a claimant’s ability  to perform  the full range of\\nwork and reduces the occupational base of work s/he can perform.  Id.  Under\\nsuch circumstances, vocational expert testimony  is needed to “clarify  the\\nimplications for the occupational base.”  Similarly , SSR 96-9p specifically\\nprovides:\\nAn individual may need to alternate the required sitting  of sedentary  work\\nby standing  (and,  possibly, walking ) periodically .  Where this need cannot\\nbe accommodated by scheduled breaks and a lunch period, the\\noccupational base for a full range of unskilled sedentary  work will be\\neroded.  The extent of the erosion will depen d on the facts in the case\\nrecord, such as the frequency  of the need to alternate sitting  and standing\\nand the length of time needed to stand.  The RFC assessment must be\\nspecific as to the frequency  of the individual’s need to alternate sitting  and\\nstanding.   It may be especially  useful in these situations to consult a\\nvocational resource in order to determine whether the individual is able to\\nmake an adjustment to other work.\\n16.Since the evidence from examining  physicians’ documents that, at the most,\\nthe claimant can perform sedentary  work, s/he is disabled under Rule *** [list\\nrule]  of the Grids.\\nL.SPECIAL  RUL ES FOR CE RTAIN O LDER WORKERS \\n1.The ALJ failed to consider whether the claimant may meet  one of the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles set forth in SSR 24-1p, which applies to this case.\\nApplicable law:   Effective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  24-1p, How\\nWe Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , rescinds and replaces SSR 82-63,\\nMedical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an Adjustm ent to\\nOther Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 8, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg.\\n48477 (June 6, 2024). This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2) no work\\nprofile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing  disability  under\\ntitles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implem enting\\n90\\nregulations.  “At step five, our adjudicators must consid er these\\nmedical-vocational profiles before referring  to the medical-vocational\\nguidelines.” \\nThese three profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that a claimant who\\nmeets one of them will be found unable to adjust to other work at step five of\\nthe sequential evaluation process withou t reference to the Medical-Vocational\\nGuidelines (“Grids”).  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two\\nprofiles, the lifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but\\nonly as it pertained to claimants with visual impairments.21  This profile was \\nincorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the requirements\\nand is not limited to claim ants with visual impairments.  The lifetime\\ncommitment  profile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .      \\nA claimant can only be found disabled based on a medical- vocational profile\\nif a finding  at step four has been made that they do not have or are unable to\\nperform PRW .  At step five, an adjudicator must consider wheth er a medical-\\nvocational profile applies before using  the Medical-Vocational g uidelines.\\nSSA will apply  SSR 24-1p on and after its applicable date in any case in\\nwhich the agency  makes a determination or decision.  If a court reverses a\\nfinal decisio n and remands a case for further administrative proceeding s after\\nthe applicable date of  SSR 24-1p, SSA will apply  this ruling  to the entire\\nperiod at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. \\n      2.The ALJ erred by not finding the claimant disabled under the “arduous\\nunskilled worker” profile described in SSR 24-1p.\\n3.The ALJ applied an incorrect definition of “arduo us work” in finding  that the \\n“arduous unskilled worker” profile was not met.  \\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-1p seeks to ensure effectuation of the regulatory\\nprovisions presently  contained in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1562, 416.9 62.  The\\narduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform  this past arduous work because of a severe\\nimpairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\nTherefore, this policy  must be consulted at step 4, before the Grids are\\n21 SSR 85-15 provides that “a finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in\\nwhich the claimant’s vocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited\\neducation or less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.”\\n91\\napplied, as a different result may  otherwise be directed.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as “phy sical work requiring  a high level of\\nstreng th or endurance.”  Id.  It elaborates:\\nArduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or\\nexertional level, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical\\ndemands that we would classify  as heavy  or very heavy  based on the\\nindividual’s description of their past work.  Work that we would not\\nclassify as heavy  or very heavy  may still be considered arduous if, for\\nexample , it demands a great deal of stamina or if it involves activity  such\\nas repetitive bend ing and lifting  at a very fast pace. An adjudicator must\\nevaluate the record to make  the ultimate finding  as to whether an\\nindividual’s work meets this criterion.\\nId. See also, POMS DI 25010.001B .1. (Arduous Unskilled Work); POMS DI\\n22001.025(C). (Arduous Unskilled W ork).  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also applied to an individual whose\\nwork experience includes very short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work,\\nas long as the individual did not acquire any trans ferable skills from those\\nperiod s of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968. SSA considers\\noccupations with specific vocational preparation (SVP ) levels one and two to\\nbe unskilled; three and four to be semi-skilled, and five or greater to be\\nskilled.  This profile is also used for a claimant whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired\\nis not readily  transferable to lig hter work. \\nSSR 24-1p also notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning ,\\narithmetic, and language skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types\\nof jobs, and that generally  SSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade\\nlevel or less is a marg inal education.

Thus, regardless of any contrary  direction by\\nthe Grids, claimants who meet the profile described above are disabled.\\nGeneral ly, lack of recent and relevant work experience is demonstrated by\\neither (1) a complete absence of work activity  during  the previous 5 years or\\n(2) the presence of only work activity  that “does not (on the basis of job\\ncontent, recency , or duration) enhance present work capability .”  Id. \\nSSR 24-1p notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA considers any\\nmedically  determinable physical or mental impairment (s) that meets the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairm ent, citing to SSR 03-3p:  Policy\\nInterpreta-tion Ruling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and\\nBlindness in Initial Claims for Individuals 65 or Older ; and citing  to SSR 23-\\n1p: Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement for Disability , discus sed infra at\\npages 120-21, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p addresses “limited education” and notes that it means ability  in\\nreasoning , arithmetic, and language skills, but not enoug h to allow an\\nindividual with these educational qualification s to do most of the more\\ncomplex  job duties needed in semi -skilled or skilled jobs and that generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal educati on is\\na limited education.

The\\njobs must have been in one field of work, meaning  that the types of work the\\nindividual performed must have been very similar to one another.

EVALUATIO N OF DISABILITY ISSUES\\nA. WEIGHT OF TREATING PHYSICIAN OPINIO N - CLAIMS\\nFILED PRIO R TO MARCH  27, 2017\\n1.The ALJ did not properly  consider 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927 by not\\nproviding  adequate weig ht to the claimant’s treating  physician opinion.\\nApplicable law: The regulations provide that more weig ht should be granted\\nto the opinions of a treating  source because:\\n[t]hese [treating ] sources are likely  to be the medical professionals most\\nable to provide a detailed, longitudin al picture of your medical\\nimpairment(s) and may bring  a unique perspective to the medical evidence\\nthat cannot be obtained from the objective medical finding s alone or from\\nreports of individual examinations.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2) , 416.927(c)(2)(2017).  An ALJ must give the\\nopinion of a treating  source controlling  weig ht if s/he finds the opinion “well-\\nsupported by medically  accepted clinical and laboratory  diagnostic\\ntechniques” and “not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the]\\ncase record.”  Id.  If the opinion of a treating  source is not accorded\\ncontrolling  weig ht, an ALJ must apply  certain factors – namel y, the length of\\nthe treatment relationship and the frequency  of examination, the nature and\\nextent of the treatment relationship , supportability  of the opinion, consistency\\nof the opinion with the record as a whole, and the specializ ation of the treating\\nsource - in determining  what weig ht to g ive the opinion.  Id.\\n94\\n2.While the ALJ referenced the treating  physician opinion of [Dr. ***] , s/he did\\nnot comply  with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927 by not providing  rationale\\nfor rejecting  that opinion.\\n3.While the ALJ relied on the claimant’s treati ng physician opinion [Dr. ***] ,\\nthe ALJ relied on portions of the opinion without explaining  why parts were\\nrejected. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that “[w]e will always give good\\nreasons in our notice of determination or decision for the weight we give your\\ntreating  source’s opinion.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(c)(2)\\n(2017).\\n4.The ALJ did not obtain information from the claimant ’s treating  provider as\\nrequired by  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(e), 416.912(e).\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(e), 416.912(e)(2017) address the\\nneed for an ALJ to obtain information from a claimant’s own medical sources\\nand possibly  to order at least one consultative examination.  The provisions\\nstate:\\nWe may ask you to attend one or more consultative examinations at our\\nexpense.  See §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t for the rules governing  the\\nconsultative examination process.  Generally , we will not request a\\nconsultative examination until we have made every  reasonable effort to\\nobtain evidence from your own medical sources.  However, in some\\ninstances, such as when a source is known to be unable to provide certain\\ntests or procedures or is known to be nonproductive or uncooperative, we\\nmay order a consultative examination while awaiting  recei pt of medical\\nsource evidence. We will not evaluate this evidence until we have made\\nevery  reasonable effort to obtain evidence from y our medical sources.\\n5.The ALJ did not consider the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15257( c),\\n416.927(c) in evaluating  the opinion of the treating  physician.\\n6.The AL J did not specify  the weig ht given to the treating  physician opinion.\\nApplicable law:  Even if the ALJ does not find that a treating  physician’s\\nopinion is entitled to controlling  weig ht, s/he must consider the factors set\\nforth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c), 416.927(c)(2017) in evaluating  any\\nmedical  source opinion and specify ing what lesser weig ht is being  assig ned. \\nThese factors are the length of treatment, frequ ency of examination, nature\\nand extent of the treatment relationship, support of opinion afforded  by\\nmedical evidence, consistency  of opinion  with the record as a whole, and\\nspecializ ation of the treating  physician.  Id.  Indeed, when evaluating  any\\nmedical source opinion – treating  or other wise, the ALJ is required to\\nconsider the factors listed in the reg ulations.  Id.\\n95\\n7.The AL J did not consider Dr. *** to be the claimant’s treating  physician.\\nApplicable law : 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1502, 416.902 (2017) provide:\\nGenerally , we will consider that you have an ongoing  treatment\\nrelationship with an acceptable medical source when the medical evidence\\nestablishes that you see, or have  seen, the source with a frequency\\nconsistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment and/or\\nevaluation required for your medical condition(s).  We may consider  an\\nacceptable medical  source who has treated or evaluated you only a few\\ntimes or only after long  intervals (e.g., twice a year) to be your treating\\nsource if the nature and frequency  of the treatment or evaluation is typical\\nfor y our condition(s).\\n8.The ALJ The ALJ did not provide proper weig ht to the opinio n of Dr. ***,\\nwho is a specialist in the impairment of which the claimant suffers.\\n9.The ALJ improperly  rejected the opinion of Dr. ***, the claimant’s primary\\ncare phy sician or treating  physician, because s/he is  not a specialist.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations specifically  provide that more weight  is\\ngenerally  accorded to speciali sts than to non-specialists.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1527(c)( 5), 416.927(c)(5) (2017) (“[w]e generally  give more weig ht to\\nthe opinion of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her area of\\nspecialty  than to the opinion of a source who is not a specialist”). However,\\nwhile the regulations recog nize that enhanced weig ht is accorded to\\nspeci alists, the fact that an individual is not a specialist is not a basis to\\ndiscredit a doctor’s opinions. Id.\\n10.The ALJ’s stated reason for rejecting the opinion of the claimant’s treating\\nphysician – that it was on an “issue reserved to the Comm issioner” – is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law: The regulations define an issue which is “reserved to the\\nCommissioner”  as an opinion that a claimant is “‘disabled’ or ‘unable to\\nwork.’”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15 27(d)(1), 416.927(d)(1) (2017).  The regulations\\ncertainly  envision treating sources providing  opinions on such issues as\\nwhether a claimant’s impairments meet or equal a listed impairment or a\\nclaimant’s functional limitations.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(d )(2), 416.927(d)(2)\\n(2017). Indeed, the regulations specifically  provide that medical reports\\nshould contain, among  other thing s, a “statement about what you can still do\\ndespite your impairment(s) . . . .”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(b)(6), 416.913(b)(6)\\n(2017).\\n11.The ALJ erred in according  more weight to the consultative examining\\nopinion than that of the claimant’s treating  physician.\\nApplicable law: In the supplementary  material published with the regulations,\\n96\\nthe Commissioner expressly  stated that the treating  physician’s opinion will\\ngenerally  be g iven g reater weig ht than the opinion of a consultative phy sician:\\nAll thing s being  equal, when a treating  source has seen a claimant long\\nenoug h to have obtained a detailed long itudinal picture of the claimant’s\\nimpairment(s), we will alway s give greater weig ht to the treating  source’s\\nopinion than to the opinions of nontreating  sources even if the other\\nopinions are also reasonable or even if the treating  source’s opinion is\\ninconsistent with other substantial evidence of record.\\n56 F ed.

EVALUATION OF MEDICAL  EVIDENCE - CLAIMS FILED\\nON OR AFT ER MARCH  27, 2017\\n1.The ALJ erred in according “little, if any,” weig ht to the opinion of the\\nclaimant’s [nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant]  based on the fact that\\nthe source was not an acceptabl e medical source (“AMS”) because the ALJ\\ndid not consider that these providers are now AMSs whose opinions can\\nestablish the ex istence of medical impairments.\\nApplicable law:  Evidence from “acceptable medical sources” is used to\\nestablish the existence of a medically  determinable impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1521, 416.921.  SSA requires objective medical evidence from an AMS\\nto establish the existence of a medically  determinable impairment(s) at step\\ntwo of the sequential evaluation process and to establish that an individual’s\\nimpairment meets a Listing .  82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5845 (Jan. 18, 2017).  The\\nlist of acceptable medical sources, discussed  in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1502,\\n416.902, has been expanded and includes, apart from licensed phys icians and\\npsychologists :\\n(1) Licens ed optometrists for impairments of visual disorders, or\\nmeasurement of visual acuity  and visual fields only, depending  on the\\nscope of practice in the State in which the optometrists’ practice;\\n(2) Licensed podiatrists for impairments of the foot, or foot and ankle only,\\ndepending  on whether the State in which the podiatrists practice permits\\nthe practice of podiatry  on the foot only , or the foot and ankle;\\n(3) Qualified speech-language pathologists for speech or language\\nimpairments only. For this source, qualified means that the speech-\\nlanguage patholog ists must be licensed by the State professional\\nlicen sing agency , or be fully  certified by the State education agency  in\\n100\\nthe State in which they practice, or hold a Certif icate of Clinical\\nCompetence in Speech- Language Patholog y from the American Speech -\\nLanguage -Hearing  Association;\\n(4) Licensed audiolo gists for impairments of hearing  loss, auditory\\nprocessing  disorders, and balance  disorders within the licensed scope of\\npractice only ;\\n(5) Licensed Advanced Practice Registered Nurses , or other licensed\\nadvanced practice  nurses with another title, for impairments within their\\nlicensed scope of practice;24 or\\n(6) Licensed Physician Assis tants for impairments within their licensed\\nscope of practice.\\nSee also POMS DI 22505.003, Evidence from an Acceptable Medical Source\\n(AMS).\\n2.The ALJ erred in according  “little, if any,” weight to the opinion of the\\nclaimant’s “other medical sourc es” as such opinions must be considered in\\ndetermining  how the claimant’s impairment affects the ability  to work, in\\naccordance with 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529(a), (c)(3) 416.929(a), (c)(3).\\nApplicable law:  Evidence from “acceptable medical sources” (“AMS”) is\\nused to establish the existence of a medic ally determinable impairment .  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1521, 416.921.  Once an impairment is established,  then SSA\\ncan use evidence from acceptable medical sources, as well as evidence from\\nnon-medical sources, to establish the severity  of the impairment and how it\\naffects a claimant’s ability  to work.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(a)(c)(3)\\n416.929(a)(c)(3).   Which providers are considered AMSs is important because\\nonly AMSs can provide objective medical evidence that establishes the\\nexistence of a medically  determinable impairment.  However, the prefatory\\nmatter to the final rule does state that adjudicators will articulate “how they\\nconsider medical opinions from all medical sources, regardless of whether or\\nnot the medical source is an AMS in final 404.1520c and 416.920c.”  82 Fed.\\nReg. 5844, 5844 (J an. 18, 2017).\\n3.The ALJ erred in not providing  any reasons for his/her rejection of the\\nopinion of Dr. ***, who opined that the claimant [state limitation] , as the\\nregulations require articulation of how this opinion was considered.\\n4.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the opinion of the State Agency  Medical\\nConsultant, who opined that the claimant [state limitation] , as the regulations\\nrequire articulation of how this opinion was considered.\\n24 In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, SSA stated that this includes four types of medical sources –\\nCertified Nurse Midwife, Nurse Practitioner, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, and Clinical Nurse\\nSpecialist.  See  81 Fe d. Re g. 62560, 62568 ( Sept. 9, 2016) .\\n101\\nApplicable law.

Suppor tability: The more relevant the objective medical evidence and suppor ting explanations\\npresented by a medical source are to suppor t his or her medical opinion(s) or prior administrative\\nmedical finding(s), the more persuasive they will be.\\n2. Cons istency: The more consistent a medical opinion(s) or prior administrative medical\\nfinding(s) is with the evidence from other medical sources and nonmedical sources in the claim,\\nthe more persuasive they will be.\\n3. Relationship with the claimant :  Thi s factor combines consideration of these five issues: \\n (i) Length of the treatment relationship: The length of time a medical source has treated a\\nclaimant may help demonstrate whether the medical source has a longitudinal unde rstanding\\nof the claimant’s impairment(s).\\n (ii)Frequency of examinations: The frequency of a claimant’s visits with the medical source\\nmay help demonstrate whether the medical source has a longitudinal understanding of the\\nclaimant’s impairment(s).\\n (iii)Purpose of the treatment relationship: The purpose for treatment a claimant received from\\nthe medical source may help dem onstrate the level of knowledge the medical source has of\\nthe claimant’s impairment(s).  \\n (iv)Extent of the treatment relationship: The kinds and extent of examinations and testing the\\nmedical source has performed or ordered from specialists or independent laboratories may\\nhelp demonstrate the level of knowledge the medical source has of a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s). \\n(v)Examining relationship: A medical source may have a better unde rstanding of a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s) if he or she examines the claimant than if the medical source only reviews\\nevidence in the folder. \\n4. Specialization: The medical opinion or prior administrative medical finding of a medical source\\nwho has received advanced education and training to become a specialist may be more\\npersuasive about medical issues related to his or her area of specialty than the medical opinion\\nor prior administrative medical finding of a medical source who is not a specialist in the relevant\\narea of specialty.\\n5. Other factors: We will consider other factors that tend to suppor t or contradict a medical\\nopinion or prior administrative medical finding.  This includes, but is not limited to, evidence\\nshowing a medical source has familiarity with the other evidence in the claim or an\\nunde rstanding of our disability program’s policies and evidentiary requirements.  Whe n we\\nconsider a medical source’s familiarity with the other evidence in a claim, we will also consider\\nwhether new evidence we receive after the medical source made his or her medical opinion or\\nprior administrative medical finding makes the medical opinion or prior administrative medical\\nfinding more or less persuasive.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c (c), 416.920c (c).  For guidance, see POMS DI 24503.025, Evaluating Medical\\nOpinions and Pr ior Adm inistrative Medical Findings. \\n103\\nIn the comments to the final regulations, SSA explains that the articula tion of\\nsupportability  and consistency  factors:\\ngenerally  includes an assessment of the supporting  objective medical\\nevidence and other medical evidence, and how consistent the medical\\nopinion or prior administrative medical finding s is with the other\\nevidence in the claim.\\n82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5859 (J an. 18, 2017).\\nThe comments also emphasiz e that there is not an inherent persuasiveness to\\nevidence from medical sources , psycholog ical sources, or consultative\\nexaminers over an individual’s own medical sources , and vice versa, and\\n“highlight that we continue to consider a medical source’s long standing\\ntreatment relationship with the individual.”  82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5844 (Jan. 17,\\n2017).  Moreover:\\nthe final rules in 404.1520c(c)(3) and 416.920c(c)(3) retain the\\nrelationship between the medical source and the claimant as one of the\\nfactors we consider as we evaluate the persuasiveness of a medical\\nopinio n.  These final rules also continue to allow an adjudicator to\\nconsider an individual’s own medical source’s medical opinion to be the\\nmost persuasive medical opinion if it is both supported by relevant\\nobjective medical evidence and the source’s explana tion, and is\\nconsistent with other evidence, as described in final 404.1520c  and\\n416.920c.\\n82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5853 (J an. 18, 2017).\\n7.In finding  that the opinion of Dr. ***, the claimant’s longtime treating\\nphysician, was not persuasive, the ALJ improperly  focused on isolated\\nstatements in the prog ress notes indicating  improvement and did not consider\\nthe evidence as a whole.\\nApplicable law.  The final rules recog nize that “evidenc e from a medical\\nsource who has a long standing  treatment relationship with an individual may\\ncontain some inconsistencies over time due to fluctuations in the severity of\\nan individual’s impairments.”  82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5857 (J an. 17, 2017).\\n8.As the medical opinions of record are equally well-supported and consistent\\nwith the record, the ALJ erred in not addressi ng all of the regulatory  factors as\\nrequired.\\n9.As every  medical provider who addressed the issue agreed that [the claimant’s\\nmental impairment is a severe  impairment or the claimant has reaching\\nlimitations, etc.]  the ALJ erred in not addressing  all of the regulatory  factors\\nas required.\\n104\\nApplicable law.  In cases where two or more differing  medical opinions  or\\nprior administrative medical finding s about the same issue are equally  well-\\nsupported and consistent with the record, but are “not exactly  the same, we\\nwill articulate how we considered the othe r most persuasive factors in\\nparag raphs (c)(3) throug h (c)(5) of this section for those medical opinions or\\nprior administrative medical finding s in your determination or decision.”  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(b)(3), 416.920c(b)(3).\\nThe regulatory  factors for assessing  medical opinions and prior adminis trative\\nfinding s(s) are as follows:\\n(1) Supportability .  “The more relevant the objective medical evidence and\\nsupporting  explanations presented by a medical  source are to support his\\nor her medical opinion(s) or prior admi nistrative medical finding (s), the\\nmore persuasive the medical opinions or prior administrative med ical\\nfinding (s) will be.”  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(1), 416.920c(c)(1).\\n(2) Consistency .  “The more consistent a medical opinion(s) or prior\\nadministrative medical finding( s) is with the evidence from other medical\\nsources and non-medical sources in the claim, the more persuasive the\\nmedical opinion(s) or prior administrative medical finding(s) will be.  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(2), 416.920c(c)(2).\\n(3) Relationship with the claimant.  This factor includes the length of the\\ntreatment relationship and the frequency of examination , which both\\n“may  help demonstrate whether the medical source has a long itudinal\\nunderstanding  of your impairment(s)”;  the purpose of the treatment\\nrelati onship which may “help demonstrate the level of knowledg e the\\nmedical source has of your impairment(s)”; the extent of the treatment\\nrelationship , which recog nizes that the “kinds and extent of examinations\\nand testing  the medical sour ce has performed or ordered from specialists\\nor indep endent laboratories may help demonstrate the level of knowledg e\\nthe medical source has of your impairment(s)”; and the examining\\nrelationship , as a “medical source may have a better understanding  of\\nyour impairment(s) if he or she examines you than if the medical sour ce\\nonly  reviews evidence in your folder.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(3)(i)-\\n(v), 416.920c(c)(3)(i)-(v).\\n(4) Specialization .  “The medical opinion or prior administrative medical\\nfinding  of a medical source who has received advanced education and\\ntraining  to become a specialist may be more persuasive about medical\\nissues related to his or her area of specialty  than the medical opinion or\\nprior administrative medical finding  of a medical sourc e who is not a\\nspecialist in the relevant area of specialty .”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520c(c)(4), 416.920c(c)(4).\\n(5) Other factors .  “We will consider other factors that tend to support or\\ncontradic t a medical opinion or prior administrative medical finding . \\n105\\nThis includes, but is not limited to, evidence showing  a medical  source\\nhas familiarity  with the other evidence in the claim or an understanding\\nof our disability  prog ram’s policies and evident iary requirements.  When\\nwe consider a medical source’s familiarity  with the other evidence in a\\nclaim, we will also consider whether new evidence we receive after the\\nmedical source made his or her medical opinion or prior administrative\\nmedical finding  makes the medical opinion or prior administrative\\nmedical finding  more or less persuasive.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(5),\\n416.920c(c)(5).\\n10.The ALJ’s finding  that the opinion of the State Agency  Medical Consultant, is\\nthe most persuasive is not based on substantial evidence as, in addition to\\nnever having examined or treated the claimant, the consultant never had the\\nopport unity to review over *** pages of medical evidence added to the record\\nsince the case was reviewed, which included key medical evidence such as\\n[MRI  evidence of hospitaliz ation, or an evaluation by  a specialist, etc.] .\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in evaluat ing medical opinions,\\nthe adjudicator can consider “evidence showing  a medical source has\\nfamiliarity  with the other evidence in the claim or an understanding  of our\\ndisability  progr am’s policies and evidentiary  requirements.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1420c(c)(5), 416.920c(c)(5).

Reg. 5844, 5831 (Jan.\\n18, 2017).\\nD. EVALUATION OF PAIN AND O THER SUB JECTIVE\\nSYMPTOMS\\n1.While the ALJ cited SSR 16-3p, s/he never actually  explained how the\\nstandard was applied to the facts and circumstances of this case.\\nApplic able law:  SSR 16-3p requires that the ALJ first consider whether there\\nis an underly ing medically  determinable impairment that could reasonably  be\\nexpected to produce the claimant’s symptoms.  The ALJ must then consider\\nwhether the condition could reasonably  be expected to produce the\\nindividual’s symptoms and must evaluate the intensity , persistence, or\\nfunctionally  limiting  effects of these sy mptoms.\\nWith regard to the latter evaluation,  the ALJ must use all of the evidence and\\nmust consid er certain factors, such as daily  activities; the location, frequency ,\\nand intensity  of pain or other symptoms; factors that precipitate and aggravate\\n107\\nsymptoms; treatment; any measures other than treatment taken to relieve\\nsymptoms; and any othe r factors concerning  the individual’s functional\\nlimitations and restrictions.  The Ruling  requires that the ALJ “discuss the\\nfactors pertinen t to the evidence of record” whereas a factor will not be\\ndiscussed “[i]f there is no information in the evidence of record regarding ” it. \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529, 416.929.\\nSSR 16-3p also “explains that we will consider  symptoms and functional\\nlimitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the objective\\nmedical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinable\\nimpairment]  or combination of impairments that meets our duration\\nrequirement.”  Id.  SSR 16-3p also clarifies that an individual’s symptoms\\nalone are not enoug h to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled\\nbased on alleg ed symptoms alone.”  Id.  See also 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a,\\n416.969a (symptoms can cause exertional or nonex ertional limitations, or\\nboth).\\n 2.The ALJ improperly  focused on the need for objective evidence in evaluating\\nthe claimant’s subjective complaints.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p does not permit an ALJ to unfavorably  evaluate\\nan individual’s symptoms based solely  on objective medical evidence.  It\\nrecog nizes symptoms cannot alway s be measured objectively , and they may\\nnot be disreg arded solely  because they are not substantiated by objective\\nmedical evidence.  Indeed, “individuals with the same medical impairment s,\\nthe same objective medical evidence, and the same non-medical evidence”\\nmay have different limitations.  Likewise, minimal or negative finding s, or\\ninconsistencies in the objective medical evidence, are just “one of the many\\nfactors” that must be considered.  The Ruling  provides that “[w]e will explain\\nwhich of an individual’s symptoms we found consistent or inconsistent with\\nthe evidence in his or her record and how our evaluation of the individual’s\\nsymptoms led to our conclusions.”\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 16-3p in focusing  on the claimant’s  overall\\ncredibility  instead of his or her sy mptoms, as required.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p, which rescin ded SSR 96-7p and eliminated use\\nof the term “credibility ,” states that the Administration “will more closely\\nfollow our regulatory  lang uage regarding  symptom evaluation.”  Instead of\\nfocusing  on credibili ty, the Ruling  refers to whether symptoms are more or\\nless “likely  to reduce” an individual’s capacities.  SSR 16-3p requires that the\\nALJ first consider whether there is an underly ing medically  determina ble\\nimpairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant’s\\nalleg ed symptoms.  The ALJ must then evaluate the intensity , persistence, or\\nfunctionally  limiting  effects of these sy mptoms.\\n108\\n4.The language of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with SSR 16-3p or\\nHAL LEX I-2-8-25(A) as the ALJ used [emotionally  charged words,\\ndisapproving  or derog atory  terms, or personal judgments or opinions; or used\\nthe decision as a forum to criticiz e the claimant] .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p mandates that adjudicators “must limit their\\nevaluation to the individual statements about his or her symptoms and the\\nevidence in the record that is relevant to an individual’s impairments.”  In\\nperforming  this evaluation, “our adjudicators will not assess an individual’s\\noverall character or truthfulness in the manner typical ly used during  an\\nadversarial court litigation.  The focus of the evaluation of an individual’s\\nsymptoms should not be to determine whether he or she is a truthful person.”\\nHAL LEX I-2-8-25(A) warns that if the record contains “evide nce that is\\npotentially  detrimental to a claimant’s health, the ALJ will take care when\\nwriting  the decision not to unnecessarily  upset or harm the claimant with the\\ndiscussion of this evidence.”  Further, in the written decision, “an ALJ will\\nnot use: Emotionally  charg ed words, disapproving  or derog atory  terms, or\\npersonal judgments or opini ons” or use the “decision as a forum for\\ncriticiz ing… the claimant.”\\n5.The ALJ erred in not considering  the fluctu ation or variance of the claimant’s\\nsymptoms over time.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p recog nizes that symptoms may vary in their\\nintensity , persistence and functional effects and may worsen or improve may\\ntime.  For this reason, “inconsistencies in an individual’s statements made at\\nvarying times does not necessarily  mean they  are inaccurate.”\\n6.The ALJ did not consider all of the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3) for evaluating  subjective complaints.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations set forth the following factors which are to\\nbe considered in evaluating  a claimant’s subjective complaints:\\n(1) Your daily  activities;\\n(2) The location, duration, frequency , and inten sity of your pain or other\\nsymptoms;\\n(3) Precipitating  and ag gravating  factors;\\n(4) The type, dosag e, effectiven ess, and side effects of any medication you\\ntake or have taken to alleviate y our pain or other sy mptoms;\\n(5) Treatment, other than medication, you receive or have received for relief\\nof your pain or other sy mptoms;\\n(6) Any measures you use or have used to relieve your pain or other\\nsymptoms (e.g., lying flat on your back, standing  for 15 to 20 minutes\\nevery  hour, sleeping  on a board, etc.); and\\n(7) Other factors concerning  your functional limitations and restrictions due\\nto pain or other sy mptoms.\\n109\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3).  However, Social Security  Ruling\\n16-3p requires that the ALJ “discuss the factors pertinent to the evidence of\\nrecord” whereas a factor will not be discussed “[i]f there is no information in\\nthe evidence of record reg arding ” it.\\n7.The ALJ did not discuss the side effects from the claimant’s medicati ons on\\nhis/her ability  to work, as required under SSR 16-3p.\\n8.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant did not alleg e any side effects from\\nhis/her medications is not based on substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p specifically  requires consideration of the “type,\\ndosag e, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication the individu al takes\\nor has taken to alleviate pain or other symptoms.”  See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1529(c)(3)(iv), 416.929(c)(3)(iv) (same).  Side effects of medications are\\nalso relevant in determining  a claimant’s RFC.  According  to SSR 96-8p, the\\nRFC assessment “must be based on all of the relevant evidence in the case\\nrecord,” including  “the effects of treatment, including  limitations or\\nrestrictions imposed by the mechanics of treatment (e.g., frequency  of\\ntreatment, duration, disruption to routine, side effects of medication).”\\nSocial Security  Ruling  03-2p, addressing  reflex sympathetic dystrophy ,\",\n",
      "  \"prev_response\": \"light of this ruling, the ALJ should not have considered whether the claimant's limitations could be accommodated in the workplace when determining disability status. The focus should remain solely on the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy, irrespective of potential accommodations.\\n\\n8. The ALJ failed to properly assess the cumulative impact of the claimant's impairments on their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-8p and SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-8p emphasizes the need for a comprehensive assessment of all impairments, both severe and non-severe, in determining a claimant's RFC. Similarly, SSR 85-15 highlights the importance of considering how mental impairments can affect an individual's ability to cope with the demands of work. The ALJ's failure to evaluate the combined effects of the claimant's impairments undermines the validity of the disability determination.\\n\\n9. The ALJ's decision lacks substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the claimant can perform other work in the national economy, given the limitations outlined in the record.\\n\\nApplicable law: The burden of proof lies with the ALJ to demonstrate that there are jobs available in the national economy that the claimant can perform, considering their RFC and limitations. If the evidence does not substantiate this conclusion, the claimant should be found disabled.\\n\\n10. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the vocational expert's testimony regarding the availability of jobs that accommodate the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: When a vocational expert provides testimony regarding job availability, the ALJ must consider this information in conjunction with the claimant's RFC and limitations. Ignoring this testimony can lead to an erroneous conclusion about the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy.\\n\\n11. The ALJ's reliance on the Grids to determine the claimant's disability status was inappropriate given the unique circumstances of the case.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Grids are designed to provide a framework for determining disability based on age, education, and work experience. However, if a claimant has non-exertional limitations that significantly impact their ability to work, the ALJ must consider additional evidence beyond the Grids to make a proper determination.\\n\\n12. The ALJ failed to adequately explain the rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and limitations, as required by SSR 16-3p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 16-3p mandates that an ALJ must provide a clear explanation for any discrepancies between a claimant's reported symptoms and the evidence in the record. A lack of thorough analysis can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's credibility and the severity of their impairments.\\n\\n13. The ALJ did not properly evaluate the medical opinions provided by the claimant's treating physician, which is contrary to the regulations set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527 and 416.927.\\n\\nApplicable law: Treating physicians' opinions are given significant weight in disability determinations, and the ALJ must provide specific reasons for any rejection of these opinions. Failure to do so can result in a flawed assessment of the claimant's RFC and overall disability status.\\n\\n14. The ALJ's decision to deny benefits is inconsistent with the medical evidence presented, which supports the claimant's allegations of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The ALJ must base their decision on substantial evidence, which includes medical records, expert opinions, and the claimant's testimony. If the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding of disability, the ALJ's denial of benefits may be legally challenged.\\n\\n15. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the impact of the claimant's mental health conditions on their ability to perform work-related activities, as outlined in SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 85-15 emphasizes the need for a thorough evaluation of how mental impairments can affect an individual's capacity to work. The ALJ's oversight in this area can lead to an incomplete understanding of the claimant's limitations and an erroneous conclusion regarding their disability status.\\n\\n16. The ALJ's finding that the claimant can perform light work is not supported by the evidence, given the claimant's documented physical limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Light work requires the ability to stand and walk for a significant portion of the workday. If the claimant's medical records indicate limitations that preclude such activities, the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform light work is not substantiated.\\n\\n17. The ALJ failed to adequately address the claimant's need for breaks and how this impacts their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-9p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-9p states that the need for frequent breaks can significantly erode the occupational base for sedentary work. The ALJ must consider this factor when determining the claimant's ability to work.\\n\\n18. The ALJ's decision lacks clarity regarding the specific jobs the claimant can perform, as required by SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14.\\n\\nApplicable law: When determining a claimant's ability to perform other work, the ALJ must identify specific job examples and their incidence in the national economy. A failure to provide this information can render the decision insufficiently supported.\\n\\n19. The ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform other work is undermined by the lack of vocational expert testimony addressing the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Vocational expert testimony is crucial in determining whether a claimant can perform other work in the national economy, especially when the claimant has unique limitations. The absence of such testimony can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's employability.\\n\\n20. The Appeals Council should remand the case for further consideration of the claimant's limitations and their impact on the ability to perform work, given the substantial evidence supporting the claim of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Appeals Council has the authority to remand cases for further evaluation when the evidence suggests that the ALJ's decision may not be supported by substantial evidence. A remand would allow for a more thorough examination of the claimant's limitations and their implications for work capacity.\"\n",

The focus should remain solely on the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy, irrespective of potential accommodations.\\n\\n8. The ALJ failed to properly assess the cumulative impact of the claimant's impairments on their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-8p and SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-8p emphasizes the need for a comprehensive assessment of all impairments, both severe and non-severe, in determining a claimant's RFC. Similarly, SSR 85-15 highlights the importance of considering how mental impairments can affect an individual's ability to cope with the demands of work. The ALJ's failure to evaluate the combined effects of the claimant's impairments undermines the validity of the disability determination.\\n\\n9. The ALJ's decision lacks substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the claimant can perform other work in the national economy, given the limitations outlined in the record.\\n\\nApplicable law: The burden of proof lies with the ALJ to demonstrate that there are jobs available in the national economy that the claimant can perform, considering their RFC and limitations. If the evidence does not substantiate this conclusion, the claimant should be found disabled.\\n\\n10. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the vocational expert's testimony regarding the availability of jobs that accommodate the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: When a vocational expert provides testimony regarding job availability, the ALJ must consider this information in conjunction with the claimant's RFC and limitations. Ignoring this testimony can lead to an erroneous conclusion about the claimant's ability to perform work in the national economy.\\n\\n11. The ALJ's reliance on the Grids to determine the claimant's disability status was inappropriate given the unique circumstances of the case.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Grids are designed to provide a framework for determining disability based on age, education, and work experience. However, if a claimant has non-exertional limitations that significantly impact their ability to work, the ALJ must consider additional evidence beyond the Grids to make a proper determination.\\n\\n12. The ALJ failed to adequately explain the rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and limitations, as required by SSR 16-3p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 16-3p mandates that an ALJ must provide a clear explanation for any discrepancies between a claimant's reported symptoms and the evidence in the record. A lack of thorough analysis can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's credibility and the severity of their impairments.\\n\\n13. The ALJ did not properly evaluate the medical opinions provided by the claimant's treating physician, which is contrary to the regulations set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527 and 416.927.\\n\\nApplicable law: Treating physicians' opinions are given significant weight in disability determinations, and the ALJ must provide specific reasons for any rejection of these opinions. Failure to do so can result in a flawed assessment of the claimant's RFC and overall disability status.\\n\\n14. The ALJ's decision to deny benefits is inconsistent with the medical evidence presented, which supports the claimant's allegations of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The ALJ must base their decision on substantial evidence, which includes medical records, expert opinions, and the claimant's testimony. If the evidence overwhelmingly supports a finding of disability, the ALJ's denial of benefits may be legally challenged.\\n\\n15. The ALJ erred in failing to consider the impact of the claimant's mental health conditions on their ability to perform work-related activities, as outlined in SSR 85-15.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 85-15 emphasizes the need for a thorough evaluation of how mental impairments can affect an individual's capacity to work. The ALJ's oversight in this area can lead to an incomplete understanding of the claimant's limitations and an erroneous conclusion regarding their disability status.\\n\\n16. The ALJ's finding that the claimant can perform light work is not supported by the evidence, given the claimant's documented physical limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Light work requires the ability to stand and walk for a significant portion of the workday. If the claimant's medical records indicate limitations that preclude such activities, the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform light work is not substantiated.\\n\\n17. The ALJ failed to adequately address the claimant's need for breaks and how this impacts their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-9p.\\n\\nApplicable law: SSR 96-9p states that the need for frequent breaks can significantly erode the occupational base for sedentary work. The ALJ must consider this factor when determining the claimant's ability to work.\\n\\n18. The ALJ's decision lacks clarity regarding the specific jobs the claimant can perform, as required by SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14.\\n\\nApplicable law: When determining a claimant's ability to perform other work, the ALJ must identify specific job examples and their incidence in the national economy. A failure to provide this information can render the decision insufficiently supported.\\n\\n19. The ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform other work is undermined by the lack of vocational expert testimony addressing the claimant's specific limitations.\\n\\nApplicable law: Vocational expert testimony is crucial in determining whether a claimant can perform other work in the national economy, especially when the claimant has unique limitations. The absence of such testimony can lead to an unsupported conclusion regarding the claimant's employability.\\n\\n20. The Appeals Council should remand the case for further consideration of the claimant's limitations and their impact on the ability to perform work, given the substantial evidence supporting the claim of disability.\\n\\nApplicable law: The Appeals Council has the authority to remand cases for further evaluation when the evidence suggests that the ALJ's decision may not be supported by substantial evidence. A remand would allow for a more thorough examination of the claimant's limitations and their implications for work capacity.. Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems, et al, 526 U.S. 795 (1999).16  In\\nCleveland , the Supreme Cour t addressed the question of whether an\\nindividual’s claim for, or receipt of, Social Security  disability  insurance\\nbenefits would preclude the individual from pursuing  a claim under the ADA. \\n526 U.S. at 797.  The Supreme Court held that:\\ndespite the appearance of confli ct that arises from the language of the two\\nstatutes, the two claims do not inherently  conflict to the point where courts\\nshould apply a special negative presumption like the one applied by the\\nCourt of Appeals here. This is because there are too many  situations in\\nwhich an SSDI  claim and an ADA claim can comfortably  exist side by\\nside.\\nId. at 802.  The Supreme Court noted that under the ADA, the issue is whether\\nan individual can perform the “essential functions” of a job “with reasonable\\naccommodation.”  Id. at 803.  In contr ast, the Court cited to a 1993\\nMemorandum from the Associate Commissioner for Hearing s and Appeals  in\\nnoting  that SSA does not take the possibility  of “reasonable accommodation”\\ninto account.  As such, an “ADA claim claiming  that the plaintiff can perform\\nher job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an\\nSSDI  claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs)\\nwithout it.”  Id. (Emphasis in original).  As adopted in Social Security  Ruling\\n00-1c:\\n \\n[W]hen the SSA determines whether an individual is disabled for SSDI\\npurposes, it does not take the possibility of “reasonable accommodation”\\ninto account,  nor need an applicant refer to the possibility  of reasonable\\naccommodation when she applies for SSDI . See Memorandum from\\nDaniel L. Skoler, Associate Comm’r for Hearing s and Appeals, SSA, to\\nAdministrative Appeals Judges, reprinted in 2 Social Security  Practice\\nGuide, App. § 15C[ 9], pp. 15-401 to 15-402 (1998).\\n16 This decision was adopted by SSA in Social Security Ruling 00-1c (Claims Filed Under Both the Social\\nSecurity Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act).\\n73\\nSSR 00-1c, Section I I (emphasis added).\\n8.The ALJ erred by not conducting  the heightened inquiry of the VE that is\\nrequired before relying on certain obsolet e occupations listed in EM-24027 to\\nfind a claimant “not disabled” at step 5 of the sequential evaluation process.\\nApplicable law:  EM-24027,17 Guidance Regarding the Citation of Certain\\nOccupations at Step Five of the Sequenti al Evaluation Process,  effective June\\n22, 2024, clarifies and consolidates guidance related to evidentiary  support\\nrequired before relying on certain obsol ete occupations to find a claimant “not\\ndisable d using the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt.\\nP, App. 2, as a framework for decision making .  It explains heightened\\nevident iary and articulation requirements about the Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Title s (DOT) occupations listed below, whose continued\\nwidespread existence multiple courts have questioned as to whether they\\ncontinue to be performed in the manner that they  are described in the DOT: \\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry\\nDesignation\\n209.587-010 Addresser clerical\\n249.587-018 Document Preparer,\\nMicrofilmingbusiness services\\n249.587-014 Cutter-and-Paster, Press\\nClipping sbusiness services\\n239.687-014 Tube Operator clerical\\n318.687-018 Silver W rapper hotel and restaurant\\n349.667-010 Host/Hostess, Dance Hall amusement and recreation\\n349.667-014 Host/Hostess, Head amusement and recreation\\n379.367-010 Surveillance-Sy stem Monitor government services\\n521.687-010 Almond B lancher, Hand canning  and preserving\\n521-687-086 Nut Sorter canning  and preserving\\n726.685-010 Magnetic-Tape W inder recording\\n782.687-030 Puller-Throug h glove and mitten\\n976.385-010 Microfilm Processor business services\\nAlternatively , adjudicator s may support the determination or decision with\\nother occupation(s) appropriate to the facts of the claim. This approach may\\n17EM-24027 m ay be accessed at: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/06212024022159PM\\n74\\nbe the most efficient way to ensure our burden at step five of the sequential\\nevaluation process is met and that the record contains the necessary  evidence\\nto support the “not disabled” finding . \\nThe EM explains that under SSR 00-4p, when there is an appare nt conflict\\nbetween vocational expert/specialist evidence and information in the DOT,\\nthe adjudicator must elicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict and\\nexplain in the determination how the conflict is resolved.  To ensure that\\nSSA’s decisions are adequately  supporte d and consistent with SSR 00-4p, this\\nEM clarifies the evidence needed to resolve these potential conflicts and\\nsupport a finding  of “not disabled” with respect to the listed occupations.\\nEM-24027 provides that an adjudicator  may not cite any of the DOT\\noccupations listed to support a framework “not disabled” determination\\nwithout additiona l evidence from a VS or VE supporting  the adjudicator’s\\nconclusion that, as the occupation is currently  performed:\\n•Its requirements are consistent with the individual’s RF C, and\\n•It exists in the national economy  in numbers that alone, or in combination\\nwith work in other cited occupations, are sig nificant.\\nThe determination must include or summariz e the VS or VE’s evidence that\\nsupports such a conclusion. This requirement applies if the adjudicato r intends\\nto rely on any of the listed occupations as support for a framework finding  of\\n“not disabled.”  \\n9.The ALJ erred in finding  claimant not disabled based on the ability  to perform\\njobs listed in the DOT which SSA has determined to be “isolated”\\noccupations which cannot be used to support a “not disabled” finding  at step 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process.\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Emerg ency  Messag e 2402618 - Isolated\\nOccupations We Will Not Use to Support a “Not Disabled” Finding at Step\\nFive of the Sequential Evaluation Process,  effective June 22, 2024, identif ies\\n114 DOT occupations which satisfy  the regulatory  defin ition of “isolated”\\noccupations in all regions of the country  that may not be cited at step 5 of the\\nsequential evaluation process to support a “not disabl ed” determination or\\ndecision that uses the Medical-Vocational Guideli nes, 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 2, as a framework  for decision making . See EM-24026\\ndiscussed at page xxvi, supra .  “Isolated” occupations are occupations with\\njobs that “exist only in very limited numbers in relatively  few locations\\noutside of the region where [the individual lives] ,”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1566(b),\\n416.966(b). \\nUnder 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1566, 416.966, when SSA makes a determination or\\n18EM- 24026 m ay be accessed at: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/06212024021759PM\\n75\\ndecisio n at step five of the sequential evaluation, SSA will not deny  disability\\nbenefits based on the existence of “isolated jobs.”  EM-24026 states  that it is\\nnot applicable to the consideration of past relevant work at step 4 of the\\nsequential evaluation process and adjudica tors may continue to rely on\\n“isolated jobs” at step 4.  \\nI.   STEP 5 - T HE VOCATIONAL FACT OR OF EDUCAT ION\\n1.The ALJ erred  in finding  that the claimant has the ability  to do semi-skilled\\nthroug h skilled work solely  on the basis of having  a high school education and\\nabove, without considering  evidence of his/her actual educati onal abilities,\\nsuch as past relevant work experience, the kind of responsibility  an individual\\nmay have had when working , daily  activities, hobbies, results of testing ,\\ncommunity  projects, or vocational training .    \\n2.The ALJ erred in not considering  evidence presented by claimant regarding\\nreceipt of special education as a factor in determining  claimant’s  education\\ncateg ory.\\nApplicable law.  Education is defined as “formal schooling  or other training\\nwhich contributes” to the claimant’s ability  to meet the vocational\\nrequirements of work, such as reasoning  ability , communication skills, and\\narithmetical ability.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(a), 416.964(a).  The regulations\\nfurther state:  \\nHowever, if you do not have forma l schooling , this does not necessarily\\nmean that you are uneducated or lack these abilities.  Past work\\nexperience and the kinds of responsibilities you had when you were\\nworking  may show that you have intellectual abilities, althoug h you may\\nhave little formal education. Your daily activities, hobbies, or the results\\nof testing may also show that you have significant intellectual ability  that\\ncan be used to work.\\nThe importance of education may depend on “how  much time has passed\\nbetween the completion of your educational education and the beginning\\nof your physical or ment al impairment(s) and by what you have done with\\nyour education in a work or other setting .”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b),\\n416.964(b).  \\n“Formal education that you completed many years before your\\nimpairment began, or unused skills and knowl edge that were a part of\\nyour formal education, may no longer be useful or meaning ful in terms of\\nyour ability to work.”  Thus, the numerical grade level may not represe nt\\nthe claimant’s  “actual educational abilities,” which may be higher or\\nlower.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b). In cases where “there is no\\nother evidence to contradict it,” SSA will use the claimant’s numerical\\ngrade level to determine educational abilities.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b),\\n76\\n416.964(b). \\nThe regulations set forth four categ ories used to assess a claima nt’s education\\nlevel.  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b); SSR 20-01p. \\nIlliteracy  – defined as “the inability  to read or write” even simple\\nmessag es such as  instructions or inven tory lists even thoug h the person\\ncan sign his or her name. The individual must be unable to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.  “Generally  an illiterate person has little or no formal\\nschooling .” \\nMargin al education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nneeded for simple, unskilled jobs.  “We generally  consider that formal\\nschooling  at a 6th grade level of formal education or less is a marg inal\\neducation.”\\nLimited education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nabilities but  not enough  for “most of the more complex  job duties needed\\nin semi-s killed or skilled jobs.”  “We generally  consider that a 7th grade\\nthroug h 11th grade level of formal education is a limited  education.”\\nHigh school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic,\\nand language skills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level\\nor above” which  generally  permits performanc e of  semi-skilled throug h\\nskilled work.\\nSee also SSR 20-01p (also addressing  the four categ ories of education).\\n  SSR 20-01p also notes that form al schooling  is the primary , but not ex clusive,\\nindicator of education level.  Ordinari ly, the highest grade completed will be\\nused to categ orize the individual’s education, regardless of the language use\\nfor instruction.  This  is not, however, the only way to determine education\\nlevel.  As noted in SSR 20-01p:\\nThe highest numerical grade level that the individual complet ed in school,\\nhowever, may not represent his or her actual educational abilities.\\nEvidence such as past work experience, the kind of responsibility  an\\nindividual may have had when working , daily  activities, hobbies, results\\nof testing , community  projects, or vocational training, may show that an\\nindividual’s actual educational abilities are higher or lower than his or her\\nformal education level.  In such situations, we may assig n an individual to\\na hig her or lower education categ ory, as appropriate.\\nPursuant to SSR 20-01p, an individual who lacks formal schooling  may\\nstill be considered educated because other evidence “may  show that the\\nindivi dual has significant intellectual ability  that can be used to work.” \\nFormal schooling  may also indic ate a level of education higher than that\\nactually  posse ssed, as determined throug h other evidence.  In either case,\\n77\\nrelevant evidence may inclu de such thing s as “past work experience, the\\nkind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily\\nactivities, hobbies, results of testing, community  projects,” and vocational\\ntraining . \\nA history  of special education can show that a person’s educational\\nabilities are lower than the grade completed.  SSR 20-01p states that the\\nnature of an individual’s formal schooling  itself is also a potentially\\nimportant consideration.  The Ruling  notes the releva nce of an extensive\\nhistory  of special educa tion, which can show that the individual’s\\neducati onal abilities are lower than the grade completed. While there is no\\nautomatic rule with respect to special education, in a particular case it may\\nmake the difference in determining  education level. \\nSSR 20-01p explains that when determining  education level with regard to\\nformal schooling , it does not matter whether the instruct ion was in English\\nor some other language. SSA “will not consider whethe r an individual\\nattained his or her education in another country or whether the individual\\nlacks English language proficiency .”  These circumstances are not\\nrelevant to “whether the individual ’s reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nabilities are commensurate with his or her formal education level.” \\nFinally , SSR 20-01p provides that “[i]n all cases, we determine facts on an\\nindividual basis. Therefore, to assig n an individual to an education\\ncateg ory lower or higher than his or her highest level of formal education,\\nthere must be specific evidence supporting  the finding  in the\\ndetermination or decision.”\\n   \\n3.The ALJ erred in not finding  that the claimant has a marg inal education and is\\ndisabled in accordance with Rule 203.01, applicable to individual who can\\nperform medium work.\\n \\nApplicable law:  Rule 203.01 directs a finding  of disability  for an individual\\nwho can perform medium work, is closely approaching  advanced age (age 50-\\n54), has a marg inal education or is illiterate and has unskilled or no work\\nexperience.  The regulations set forth four categ ories used to asses s a\\nclaim ant’s education level.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b), 416.964(b); SSR 20-\\n01p. [1] The difference between a marg inal education and limited education is\\nas follows:  \\n \\nMarginal education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nneeded for simple, unskilled jobs.  “We generally  consider that formal\\nschooling at a 6th grade level of formal education or less is a marg inal\\neducation.”\\nLimited education – ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills\\nabilities but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job duties needed\\nin semi-skille d or skilled jobs.”  “We generally  consider that a 7th grade\\n78\\nthroug h 11th grade level of formal education is a limited education.”\\n \\nSSR 20-01p notes that forma l schooling  is the primary , but not exclusive,\\nindicator of education level.  Ordinarily , the highest grade completed will be\\nused to categ orize the individual’s education.  This is not, however, the only\\nway to determine education level.  Pursuant to SSR 20-01p, an individual who\\nlacks formal schooling  may still be considered educated because other\\nevidence “may show that the individual has significant intellectual ability  that\\ncan be used to work.”  Formal schooling  may also indicate a level of\\neducatio n higher than that actually  possessed, as determined throug h other\\nevidence.  In either case, relevant evidence may include such thing s as “past\\nwork experience, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when\\nworking , daily  activities, hobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and\\nvocational training . \\n \\nMoreover, as set forth in SSR 20-1p, a history  of special education can show\\nthat a person’s education al abilities are lower than the grade completed.  SSR\\n20-01p states that the nature of an individual’s formal schooling  itself is also a\\npotenti ally important consideration.  The Ruling  notes the relevance of an\\nextensive history  of special education, which can show that the individual’s\\neducational abilities are lower than the grade completed. While there is no\\nautomatic rule with respect to special education, in a particular case it may\\nmake the difference in determining  education level.\\n4.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant  has a limited education when, in\\nfact, he has a marg inal education and meets all of the requirements as a\\n“Worn Out W orker.”\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-1p seeks to ensure effectuation of the regulatory\\nprovisions presently  contained in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1562, 416.962.  Pursuant\\nto the policy  embodied therein, a claimant with a marg inal education and\\nwork experience consisting  only of 35 or more years of arduous physical labor\\nis ordinarily  disabled so long as an impairment prevents return to the\\nclaimant’s usual level of work.  Therefore, this policy  must be consulted at\\nstep 4, before the Grids are applied, as a different result may otherwise be\\ndirected for individuals who have not y et attained the ag e of 60.\\n5.The ALJ erred in apply ing a Grid rule that applies to  individuals who have a\\nhigh school education or more with “direct entry  into skilled work” as the\\nevidence documents that the claimant has a remote education.    \\n6.The ALJ committed reversible error in applying Grid Rule 201.05 [or Rule\\n201.08, 210.13, 201.16, 202.05, 202.08]  as there is no evidence of record  to\\nsupport a finding  that the claimant has a high school education which provides\\nfor direct entry  into skilled work.\\nApplicable law:  Each of the cited Grid Rules applies when a claimant is a\\nhigh school graduate or more which “provides for direct entry into skilled\\nwork,” and has no transferable skills.  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, §\\n79\\n201.08, 210.13, 201.16, 202.05, 202.08.  The preamble to the Grids further\\nexplains that:\\n(d) The adversity  of functional restrictions to sedentary  work at advanced\\nage (55 and over) for individuals with no relevant past work or who can\\nno longer perform vocationally  relevant past work and have no\\ntransferable skills, warrants a finding of disabled in the absence of the\\nrare situation where the individual has recently completed education\\nwhich provides a basis for direct entry into skilled sedentary work. \\nAdvanced age and a histo ry of unskilled work or no work experience\\nwould ordinarily  offset any vocational advantag es that might accrue by\\nreason of any remote past education, whether it is more or less than\\nlimited education.\\nId. at § 201.00(d) (emphasis added).\\n7.The ALJ erred in not considering the claimant’s illiteracy  and that s/he is\\ndisabled in accordance with Vocational Rules 201.17 and/or 202.09.\\n \\n8.The ALJ erred in finding  claimant literate solely  on the basis of having\\ncompleted the fourth grade or more, despite evidence demonstrating  an\\ninability  to read or write a simple messag e in any  lang uage.\\nApplicable law:  Illiteracy  is defined as “the inability  to read or write.” 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1564((b)(1), 416.964(b)(1). The reg ulations further provide:\\n \\nWe consider someone illiterat e if the person cannot read or write a simple\\nmessag e such as instructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can\\nsign his or her name.  Generally , an illiterate person has had little or no\\nformal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p, effective April 27, 2020, makes clear that illiterate does not\\nmean unable to read or write in English and that a person who cannot\\ncommunicate in English may still be considered literate. SSR 20-01p explains\\nthat SSA will assign an individual to the illiteracy  categ ory only if the\\nindividual is unable to read or write a simple messag e in any language,”\\n(emphasis supplied) noting  that most individuals learn to read and write  at\\nleast a simple messag e by the time they complete fourth grade, regardless of\\nwhether the schooling  occurred in the United States or in another country . \\nGenerally , claimants who have completed the fourth grade or more are not\\nilliterate.  However, SSR 01p ex plains:\\n \\nWe may still find, however, that an individual with at least a fourth grade\\neducation is illiterate if the individual provides evidence showing  that\\ndespite having  completed fourth grade or more, he or she cannot, in fact,\\nread or write a simple messag e in any languag e. Examples of relevant\\nevidence may  include whether an individual: \\n80\\n • has received long -term special education related to difficulty learning\\nto read or write at a basic level;\\n •  lacks work history  due to an inability  to read or write;\\n • has valid intelligence test results demonstrating  an inability  to read or\\nwrite a simple messag e, or has valid reading  and writing  test results\\ndemonstrating  an inability  to read or write a simple messag e, althoug h\\ntest results alone will not be relied on to determine that illiteracy  is the\\nappropriate education categ ory for an individual; and\\n • has any other evidence demonstrating an inability  to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.”\\n \\nSSR 20-01p also states that SSA will not “make any general finding  that\\nilliteracy  is the appropriate category for individuals who have not completed a\\nfourth grade education.”  In such circumstances, SSA will “consider all\\nrelevant evidence in the claim to determine whether illiteracy  is the\\nappropriate education categ ory.” SSA uses evidence which may include\\nwhether the individual: \\n \\n• “has worked in the past and the responsibilities he or she had when \\nworking ”;\\n \\n•“can read, write, and understand short and simple statements in every\\nday life, such as shopping  lists, short notes,”;\\n \\n• “can read newspapers or books”;\\n \\n• “can write emails or tex t messag es”;\\n \\n• “had any  vocational training  or certifications requiring  reading  and\\n    writing ”;\\n \\n•“has or ever had a driver’s licenses that required passing  a written\\ntest”;  and\\n • “has any  other evidence demonstrating  an inability  to read or write a\\nsimple messag e.”\\nJ.    STEP 5 – T HE VOCATIONAL FACT OR OF AGE\\n1.The ALJ committed reversib le error in mechanically  apply ing the age criteria\\nof the Grids as the claimant was within a few months of turning  age 50 [or age\\n55 or ag e 60]  when the AL J issued his/her decision.\\n2.The ALJ committed reversible error in mechanically  apply ing the age\\ncateg ory of the Grids due to the claimant’s borderline ag e.\\n81\\nApplicabl e law:  The regulations provide that the age criteria of the Medical-\\nVocational Guidelines are not to be mechanically  applied in borderline\\nsituations:\\nWe will not apply  the age categories mechanically  in a borderline\\nsituation.  If you are within a few days to a few months of reaching  an\\nolder age categ ory, and using  the older age category would result in a\\ndetermination or decision that you are disabled, we will consider whether\\nto use the older age category after evaluating the overall impact of all the\\nfactors of y our case.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1563(b), 416.963(b). HAL LEX § I-2-2-42 indicates that an\\nadjudicator should apply  a two-part test for ident ifying borderline age\\nsituations.  First, the adjudicator should determine if the claimant’s age is\\nwithin a few days or a few months of the next highest age categ ory, and if so,\\nshould then determine whether using  the next higher age categ ory results in a\\ndecision of “disabled,” instead of “not disabled.”  HALLEX § I-2-2-42(B ). \\n“If the answer to both parts of the test is ‘yes,’ a borderline age situation\\nexists, and the ALJ must decide whether it is more appropriate  to use the\\nclaimant’s chronolog ical age or the higher age categ ory.” Id. (Emphasis\\nadded).  “Generally , SSA considers a few days to a few months to mean a\\nperiod not to exceed six months.” HAL LEX § I-2-2-42(B )(1).  In cases where\\n“using  the higher age categ ory does affect the outcome of the decision, a\\nborderline age situation does exist,” and the ALJ will use the procedures\\noutlined in HAL LEX I-2-2-42 C below.”  Id.\\nFor additional g uidance, see also  POMS DI  25015.006, B orderline Ag e.\\nK.STEP 5 – T HE MEDICAL -VOCATIONAL RULES (GRIDS)\\n1.Even thoug h the claimant’s exertional level fell between two levels of the\\nGrids which direct opposite conclusions, the ALJ committed reversible error\\nin not apply ing the lower rule which directs a finding  of disability .\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in cases “where an individual\\nhas an impairment or combination of impairments resulting  in both streng th\\nlimita tions and nonex ertional limitations,” the Grid rules “are considered in\\ndetermining  first whether a finding  of disabled may be possible based on the\\nstreng th limitations alone . . . .”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subp t. P, App. 2\\n(hereinafter “Grids”) § 200.00(e)(2). Social Securi ty Ruling  83-12 addresses\\nthe situation where the “exertional level falls between two rules which direct\\nopposite conclusions, i.e., ‘Not disabled’  at the higher exertional level and\\n‘Disabled’ at the lower ex ertional level . . . .”  This Ruling  provides:\\nAn exertiona l capacity  that is only slightly reduced in terms of the\\nregulatory  criteria could indicate a sufficient remaining  occupational base\\nto satisfy  the minimal requirements for a finding  of ‘Not disabled.’\\n82\\nOn the other hand, if the exertional capacity is significantly reduced in\\nterms of the regulatory definition, it could indicat e little more than the\\noccupational base for the lower rule and could justify a finding of\\n“Disabled.”\\nIn situations where the rules would direct different conclusions, and the\\nindividual’s exertional limitations  are somewhere ‘in the middle’ in terms\\nof the regulatory  criteria for exertional rang es of work, more difficult\\njudg ments are involved as to the sufficienc y of the remaining  occupational\\nbase to support a conclusion as to disability . According ly, VS assistance is\\nadvisable for these ty pes of cases.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n2.The ALJ erred by not apply ing the Grid rule applicable to an individual who\\nhas an unskilled work history  given his/her lack of transferable skills, and by\\nnot finding  him/her disabled in accordance with Rule 201.09 and/or Rule\\n201.17 and/or Rule 202.09 of the Grids.\\nApplicable law:  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past work, we\\nconsider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them in other\\nskilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.965(a).  And if\\nthe claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n \\nIn 2003, SSA proposed reg ulatory  amendments to:\\nensure that our regulations clearly  reflect our long standing  policy  that, if\\nyou have skilled or semiskilled work experience, but you cannot use your\\nskills in other work  (i.e., your skills are not transferable to other work),\\nyour ability  to adjust to other work is no greater than it would be if you\\nhad only  unskilled work ex perience.\\n68 Fed. Reg. 40213 (July 7, 2003).19 As SSA has explained, the regulations\\ncurrently  provide that “if your skills cannot be transferred to other work\\nwithin your RFC, we consider you to be no better off than if you have only\\nunskilled work experience” and in cases where all of the other vocational\\nfactors are the same, “we will make the same decision if you have work skills\\nthat do not transfer to other work, as we will for a person who has unskilled\\nwork experience.” 68 Fed. Reg. at 40215 (citing  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a),\\n416.965(a)).  One of the proposed chang es was to Rules 201.17, 201.19, and\\n202.09 and to clarify  that these rules applied “if you have unskilled or no\\nwork experience, or if you have a skilled or semiskilled work  experience with\\nno transferable skills.” 20 F ed. Reg . at 40215.\\n19 This  proposed rule was never finalized.\\n83\\n3.The ALJ committed reversible error in relying on vocational expert testimony\\nas it conflicted with the Grids.\\nApplicable law:  The Grids are conclusiv e and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted a “rebuttable presumption” of disability that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10 directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational expert that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particular individual’s\\nvocati onal factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disable d.  However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)).  SSA has noted that since “there is no\\nprovision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact for\\nSSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations,” the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the directed conclusion of disabili ty was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ committ ed reversible error by not obtaining  vocational expert\\ntestimony  in lig ht of the claimant’s need for an assistive device.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in Social Security  96-9p, to perform the full\\nrange of sedentary  work, a claiman t must be able to walk and stand for a total\\nof “no more than about 2 hours of an 8-hour workday .”  This Ruling goes on\\nto state that an individual who cannot stand and walk for two hours a day\\ncannot perform the full range of sedentary  work.  Id.  SSR 96-9p further notes\\nthat “the occupational base for an individual who must use [an assistive]\\ndevice for balance because of significant involvem ent of both lower\\nextremities (e.g., becaus e of a neurolog ical impairment) may be significantly\\neroded.”  Id.  “In these situations, too, it may be especially  useful to consult a\\nvocational resource in order to make a judgment regarding the individual’s\\nability  to make an adjustment to other work.”  Id. See also POMS DI\\n25015.020(B )(6) (addre ssing “Medically  required hand-held assistive\\ndevice”).\\n 5.The ALJ erred by not obtain ing vocational expert testimony  in light of the\\nclaimant’s manipulative limitations.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  85-15 provides that reachi ng\\n(extending  the hands and arms in any direction) and handling  (seiz ing,\\n84\\nholding , grasping , turning  or otherwise working  primarily  with the whole\\nhand or hands) are activities required in almost all jobs.  Sign ificant\\nlimitations of reaching  or handling  may eliminate a large number of\\noccupatio ns a person could otherwise do. Vary ing degrees of limitations\\nwould have different effects, and a vocational expert’s assistance may be\\nneeded to determine the effects of the limitations.  Id.\\nAs set forth in SSR 83-10, lig ht work entails the “use of arms and hands to\\ngrasp and to hold and turn objects” and “[m]ost unskilled sedentary  jobs\\nrequire good use of the hands and fingers for repetitive hand-fi nger\\nactions .”  Id.  Moreover, “[m]ost unskilled sedentary  jobs require good use\\nof both hands and the fingers; i.e., bilateral manual dexterity .”  SSR 96-\\n9p.  More over, “[a]ny significant manipulative limitation of an\\nindividual’s ability  to handle and work with small objects with both hands\\nwill result in a significant erosion of the unskilled sedentary  occupational\\nbase.”  Id.\\n6.In light of the claimant’s limited use of his/her dominant upper extremity ,\\nvocational testimony  was needed.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 83-12, Special Situations, No. 2 provides:\\nLoss of Use of an Upper Extremity\\nA person who has lost the use of an arm or hand beca use of amputation,\\nparaly sis, etc., obviously  cannot perform jobs which require use of both\\narms or both hands.  Loss of major use of an upper extremity  is rather\\ndefinitive in that there is a considerable absence of functional ability  . . ..\\nExperience with persons who have lost the use of an upper extremity  has\\nshown that their potential occupational base is between the occupational\\nbases for Table No. 1 (sedentar y work) and Table No. 2 (light work). \\nWhile individuals with this impairment have been known to perform\\nselected occupations at nearly  all exertional levels, the total number  of\\noccupations within their RFC’s is less than the number represented by a\\nfull or wide range of light work.  These individuals would generall y not be\\nexpected to perfor m sedentary  work because most unskilled sedentary\\njobs require good use of both hands. Persons who have the least remaining\\nfunction would have only the lower occupational base, while those who\\nhave the most remaining  function would have some of the higher\\noccupational base added in terms of numbers of jobs which can be\\nperformed with this type of impairment.  Given an individual’s particular\\nRFC, a VS will be able to determine the size of the remaining\\noccupational base, cite specific jobs within the individu al’s RFC, and\\nprovide a statement of the incidence of those jobs in the region of the\\nindividual’s residence or in several reg ions of the country .\\n7.Given the fact that the claimant cannot lift 10 pounds, which is a significant\\nlimitation of the occupational base, vocational ex pert testimony  was needed.\\n85\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 96-9p, “[l]ifting/carry ing and\\npushing /pulling : If an individual is unable to lift 10 pounds or occasio nally lift\\nand carry  items like docket files, ledgers, and small tools throug hout the\\nworkday , the unskilled sedentary  occupational base will be eroded.”\\n8.Vocational expert testimony  was needed in light of the claimant’s\\nenvironmental restrictions.\\nApplicable law : As noted in Social Security  Ruling  85-15:\\nWhere a person has a medica l restriction to avoid excessive amounts of\\nnoise, dust, etc., the impact on the broad world of work would be minimal\\nbecause most job environments do not involve great noise, amounts of\\ndust, etc.\\nWhere an individual can tolerate very little noise, dust, etc., the impact on\\nthe ability to work would be considerable because very few job\\nenvironments are entirely free of irritants, pollutants, and other\\npotentially damaging conditions .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n9.In light of the presence of significant nonex ertional limitations of *** [state\\nlimitations]  that affect the claimant’s occupational base, the ALJ erred by not\\nobtaining  vocational expert testimony .\\n10.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant suffe rs from a severe mental \\nimpairment and that, as a result, s/he is limited to simple, repetitive tasks,\\nvocational expert testimony  was required.\\nApplicable law: The regulations at 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a(c)(1),\\n416.969a(c)(1) set forth  the following  examples of nonex ertional limitations\\nor restrictions:\\n  \\n(i)You have difficulty  functioning  because you are nervous, anxious, or\\ndepressed;\\n(ii)You have difficulty  maintaining  attention or concentrating ;\\n(iii)You have difficulty  understandi ng or remembering  detailed instruc-    \\ntions;\\n(iv) You have difficulty  in seeing  or hearing ;\\n(v)You have difficulty  tolerating  some  physical feature(s) of certain work\\nsetting s, e.g ., you cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or\\n(vi)You have diffic ulty performing  the manipulative or postural functions\\nof some work such as reaching , handling , stooping , climbing ,\\ncrawling , or crouching .\\nSocial Security  Ruling  83-10 also discusses nonex ertional limitations and\\nprovides:\\n86\\nNonexertional Impairme nt.  Any impairment which does not directly\\naffect the ability to sit, stand, walk, lift, carry , push, or pull. This includes\\nimpairments which affect the mind, vision, hearing , speech, and use of the\\nbody  to climb, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl, reach, handle, and use\\nof the fing ers for fine activities.\\nAs ex plained in the preamble to the Medical-Vocational Guidelines:\\nSince the rules are predicated on an individual’s having  an impairment\\nwhich mani fests itself by limitations in meeting  the streng th requirements\\nof jobs, they may not be fully  applicable where the nature of an\\nindividual’s impai rment does not result in such limitations, e.g., certain\\nmental, sensory, or skin impairments.  In addition, some impairments may\\nresult solely  in postural and manipulative limitations or environmental\\nrestrictions.\\n20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e).  The preamble  goes on to\\nstate that the “rules do not direct factual conclusions of disabled or not\\ndisabled for individuals with solely  nonex ertional types of impairments.”   20\\nC.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e)(1). Further, if a claimant has “an\\nimpairment or combi nation of impairments resulting  in both streng th\\nlimitations and nonex ertional limitations,” the preamble states the following :\\nthe rules in this subpart are considered in determining  first whether a\\nfinding  of disabled may be possible based on the streng th limitations alone\\nand, if not, the rule(s) reflecting  the individual’s maximum residual\\nstreng th capabilities, age, education, and work  experience provide a\\nframework for consideration of how much the individual’s work\\ncapability  is further diminished in terms of any types of jobs that would be\\ncontraindicated by the nonex ertional limitations.  Also, in these\\ncombinations of nonex ertional and exertional limitations which cannot be\\nwholly  determined under the rules in this Appendix  2, full consideration\\nmust be given to all of the relevant facts in the case in acco rdance with the\\ndefinitions and discuss ions of each factor in the appropriate sections of the\\nregulations, which will provide insig ht into the adjudicative weig ht to be\\naccorded each factor.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, § 200.00(e)(2).\\n11.Even accepting  the ALJ’s finding  that the claima nt was limited to “simple\\ntasks,” vocational testimony  was needed.\\nApplicable law:  An ALJ’s finding  that “all the jobs encompassed by the\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines are unskilled jobs involving  only simple\\ntasks” is not an accurate statement.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a, 416.969a lists\\nthe following  examples of nonexertional limitations:\\n(c) Nonex ertional limitations.\\n87\\n(1) When the limitations and restrictions imposed by your impairment(s)\\nand related symptoms, such as pain, affect only your ability  to meet the\\ndemands of jobs other than the streng th demands, we consider that you\\nhave only nonex ertional limitations or restrictions.   Some examples of\\nnonex ertional limitations or restrictions include the following :\\n(i)You have difficulty  functioning  because you are nervous, anxious,\\nor depressed;\\n(ii)You have difficulty  maintaining  attention or concentrating ;\\n(iii) You have difficulty  understanding  or remembering  detailed            \\n     instructions;\\n(iv) You have difficulty  in seeing  or hearing ;\\n(v)You have difficulty  tolerating  some physical feature(s) of certain\\nwork setting s, e.g ., you cannot tolerate dust or fumes; or\\n(vi)You have difficulty  performing  the manipulative or postural\\nfunctions of some work such as reaching , handling, stooping ,\\nclimbing , crawling , or crouching .\\nId. The ALJ’s limitation of “simple tasks, ” by definition, means that the\\nclaimant has “difficulty  understanding  or remembering  detailed\\ninstructions,” such that vocational expert testimony  is needed.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1569a(c)(1)(iii), 416.969a(c)(1)(iii).\\nThe Dictionary of Occupati onal Titles (DOT)  discusses these types of\\nlimitations as the “reasoning ” function of a job.  See DOT, Appendix  C. \\nThis is part of the General Educational Development (“GED”) of jobs,\\nwhich “embraces those aspects of educ ation (formal and informal) which\\nare required of the worker for satisfactory  job performance.” According  to\\nthe DOT, reasoning  level “1” jobs can be performed by an individual who\\ncan understand and carry out “simple” instructions; level “2” jobs can be\\nperformed by an individual who can understand and carry  out “detailed\\nbut uninvolved written  or oral instructions;” and level “3” jobs entail even\\ngreater abilities.20  Id.  Furthermore, as set forth in the DOT, unski lled jobs\\neither have reason ing levels of 1, 2 or 3, depending  on the job.  For\\nexample,  the unskilled sedentary  job of a surveillance system monitor has\\n20 Reasoning scales range from a low of “1” to a high of “6,”  with levels 1 to 3 de fined as follows: \\nLEVEL 3: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out instructions furnished in written, oral,\\nor diagrammatic form. Deal with problems involving several concrete variables in or from\\nstandardized situations.\\nLEVEL 2: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out detailed but uninvolved written or oral\\ninstructions. Deal with problems involving a few concrete variables in or from standardized\\nsituations.\\nLEVEL 1: Apply  commonsense unde rstanding to carry out simple one- or two-step instructions.\\nDeal with standardized situations with occasional or no variables in or from these situations\\nencountered on the job.\\nDOT, Appendi x C.\\n88\\na reasoning  level of “3,” which requires much greater ability than the\\nability  to carry  out simple instructions.  An ALJ’s finding  that a claimant\\nis limited to work which entails “simple tasks” requires the testimony of a\\nvocational expert to determine what jobs could be performed by an\\nindividual with this specific limitation.\\n12.The claimant’s need for limited public contact is a significant nonex ertional\\nlimitation which required consideration by  a vocational ex pert.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-14 recog nizes that limited public contact is a\\nsignificant restriction which may well impact one’s ability  to perform\\nunskilled work.  This Ruling  discusses dealing  with the public and provides:\\nMenta l activities are also nonex ertional. Jobs at various levels of\\ncomplex ity require mental functions such as intellectual competence and\\nability  to function in terms of behavior, affect, thought, memory ,\\norientation and contac t with reality .  Exposure to particular work stresses\\nmay not be medically  sustainable for some persons with mental\\nimpairments, as would be the case with some persons who have physical\\nimpairments (e.g., certain cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disorders). \\nDepending  on the nature and extent of a person’s mental impairment\\nwhich does not meet or equal the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments,\\nrelativ ely broad or narrow types of work may be precluded (e.g., dealing\\nwith a variety of abstract and concrete variables with\\nnonverbal–sy mbolism--a highly skilled level of work--or dealing\\nfrequently with members of the public--a particular type of work at any\\nlevel of complexity ). Althoug h ment al impairments such as considered to\\nbe nonex ertional, some conditions (e.g., depression or a conversion\\nreaction) may  also affect a person’s ex ertional capacity .\\nId. (emphasis added).  \\nAdditionally , SSR 85-15 provides specific examples of nonex ertional\\nlimitations which impact the occupational base.  One ex ample cited is:\\nExample 3:  Someone who is closely  approaching retirement age, has a\\nlimited education or less, worked for 30 years in a cafeteria doing an\\nunskilled job as a “server,” almost constantly  dealing  with the public, and\\nnow cannot, because of a severe mental impairment, frequently deal  with\\nthe public.  In light of the narrowed voca tional opportunity  in conjunction\\nwith the person’s age, education, lack of skills, and long commitment to\\nthe particular ty pe of work, a finding  of disabled would be appropriate. . . .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant was limited to a “low-stress” job,\\ns/he erred by  not obtaining  the testimony  of a VE.\\n89\\n14.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant suffers from a severe mental\\nimpairment of *** [list impairment(s)]  and that s/he is limited to work with\\n“low stress demands,” vocational ex pert testimony  was required.\\nApplicable law: SSR 85-15 recog nizes that “the mentally  impaired may have\\ndifficulty  meeting  the requirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.”\\n15.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant requires a sit/stand option, a\\nlimitation which by itself affects the occupational base, vocational expert\\ntestimony  was required.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 83-12, “[u]nskilled types of jobs are\\nparticularly  structured so that a person cannot ordinarily  sit or stand at will.” \\nA sit/stand limitation affects a claimant’s ability  to perform  the full range of\\nwork and reduces the occupational base of work s/he can perform.  Id.  Under\\nsuch circumstances, vocational expert testimony  is needed to “clarify  the\\nimplications for the occupational base.”  Similarly , SSR 96-9p specifically\\nprovides:\\nAn individual may need to alternate the required sitting  of sedentary  work\\nby standing  (and,  possibly, walking ) periodically .  Where this need cannot\\nbe accommodated by scheduled breaks and a lunch period, the\\noccupational base for a full range of unskilled sedentary  work will be\\neroded.  The extent of the erosion will depen d on the facts in the case\\nrecord, such as the frequency  of the need to alternate sitting  and standing\\nand the length of time needed to stand.  The RFC assessment must be\\nspecific as to the frequency  of the individual’s need to alternate sitting  and\\nstanding.   It may be especially  useful in these situations to consult a\\nvocational resource in order to determine whether the individual is able to\\nmake an adjustment to other work.\\n16.Since the evidence from examining  physicians’ documents that, at the most,\\nthe claimant can perform sedentary  work, s/he is disabled under Rule *** [list\\nrule]  of the Grids.\\nL.SPECIAL  RUL ES FOR CE RTAIN O LDER WORKERS \\n1.The ALJ failed to consider whether the claimant may meet  one of the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles set forth in SSR 24-1p, which applies to this case.\\nApplicable law:   Effective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  24-1p, How\\nWe Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , rescinds and replaces SSR 82-63,\\nMedical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an Adjustm ent to\\nOther Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 8, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg.\\n48477 (June 6, 2024). This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2) no work\\nprofile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing  disability  under\\ntitles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implem enting\\n90\\nregulations.  “At step five, our adjudicators must consid er these\\nmedical-vocational profiles before referring  to the medical-vocational\\nguidelines.” \\nThese three profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that a claimant who\\nmeets one of them will be found unable to adjust to other work at step five of\\nthe sequential evaluation process withou t reference to the Medical-Vocational\\nGuidelines (“Grids”).  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two\\nprofiles, the lifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but\\nonly as it pertained to claimants with visual impairments.21  This profile was \\nincorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the requirements\\nand is not limited to claim ants with visual impairments.  The lifetime\\ncommitment  profile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .      \\nA claimant can only be found disabled based on a medical- vocational profile\\nif a finding  at step four has been made that they do not have or are unable to\\nperform PRW .  At step five, an adjudicator must consider wheth er a medical-\\nvocational profile applies before using  the Medical-Vocational g uidelines.\\nSSA will apply  SSR 24-1p on and after its applicable date in any case in\\nwhich the agency  makes a determination or decision.  If a court reverses a\\nfinal decisio n and remands a case for further administrative proceeding s after\\nthe applicable date of  SSR 24-1p, SSA will apply  this ruling  to the entire\\nperiod at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. \\n      2.The ALJ erred by not finding the claimant disabled under the “arduous\\nunskilled worker” profile described in SSR 24-1p.\\n3.The ALJ applied an incorrect definition of “arduo us work” in finding  that the \\n“arduous unskilled worker” profile was not met.  \\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-1p seeks to ensure effectuation of the regulatory\\nprovisions presently  contained in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1562, 416.9 62.  The\\narduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform  this past arduous work because of a severe\\nimpairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\nTherefore, this policy  must be consulted at step 4, before the Grids are\\n21 SSR 85-15 provides that “a finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in\\nwhich the claimant’s vocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited\\neducation or less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.”\\n91\\napplied, as a different result may  otherwise be directed.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as “phy sical work requiring  a high level of\\nstreng th or endurance.”  Id.  It elaborates:\\nArduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or\\nexertional level, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical\\ndemands that we would classify  as heavy  or very heavy  based on the\\nindividual’s description of their past work.  Work that we would not\\nclassify as heavy  or very heavy  may still be considered arduous if, for\\nexample , it demands a great deal of stamina or if it involves activity  such\\nas repetitive bend ing and lifting  at a very fast pace. An adjudicator must\\nevaluate the record to make  the ultimate finding  as to whether an\\nindividual’s work meets this criterion.\\nId. See also, POMS DI 25010.001B .1. (Arduous Unskilled Work); POMS DI\\n22001.025(C). (Arduous Unskilled W ork).  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also applied to an individual whose\\nwork experience includes very short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work,\\nas long as the individual did not acquire any trans ferable skills from those\\nperiod s of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968. SSA considers\\noccupations with specific vocational preparation (SVP ) levels one and two to\\nbe unskilled; three and four to be semi-skilled, and five or greater to be\\nskilled.  This profile is also used for a claimant whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired\\nis not readily  transferable to lig hter work. \\nSSR 24-1p also notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning ,\\narithmetic, and language skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types\\nof jobs, and that generally  SSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade\\nlevel or less is a marg inal education.

Thus, regardless of any contrary  direction by\\nthe Grids, claimants who meet the profile described above are disabled.\\nGeneral ly, lack of recent and relevant work experience is demonstrated by\\neither (1) a complete absence of work activity  during  the previous 5 years or\\n(2) the presence of only work activity  that “does not (on the basis of job\\ncontent, recency , or duration) enhance present work capability .”  Id. \\nSSR 24-1p notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA considers any\\nmedically  determinable physical or mental impairment (s) that meets the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairm ent, citing to SSR 03-3p:  Policy\\nInterpreta-tion Ruling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and\\nBlindness in Initial Claims for Individuals 65 or Older ; and citing  to SSR 23-\\n1p: Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement for Disability , discus sed infra at\\npages 120-21, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p addresses “limited education” and notes that it means ability  in\\nreasoning , arithmetic, and language skills, but not enoug h to allow an\\nindividual with these educational qualification s to do most of the more\\ncomplex  job duties needed in semi -skilled or skilled jobs and that generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal educati on is\\na limited education.

The\\njobs must have been in one field of work, meaning  that the types of work the\\nindividual performed must have been very similar to one another.

EVALUATIO N OF DISABILITY ISSUES\\nA. WEIGHT OF TREATING PHYSICIAN OPINIO N - CLAIMS\\nFILED PRIO R TO MARCH  27, 2017\\n1.The ALJ did not properly  consider 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927 by not\\nproviding  adequate weig ht to the claimant’s treating  physician opinion.\\nApplicable law: The regulations provide that more weig ht should be granted\\nto the opinions of a treating  source because:\\n[t]hese [treating ] sources are likely  to be the medical professionals most\\nable to provide a detailed, longitudin al picture of your medical\\nimpairment(s) and may bring  a unique perspective to the medical evidence\\nthat cannot be obtained from the objective medical finding s alone or from\\nreports of individual examinations.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2) , 416.927(c)(2)(2017).  An ALJ must give the\\nopinion of a treating  source controlling  weig ht if s/he finds the opinion “well-\\nsupported by medically  accepted clinical and laboratory  diagnostic\\ntechniques” and “not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the]\\ncase record.”  Id.  If the opinion of a treating  source is not accorded\\ncontrolling  weig ht, an ALJ must apply  certain factors – namel y, the length of\\nthe treatment relationship and the frequency  of examination, the nature and\\nextent of the treatment relationship , supportability  of the opinion, consistency\\nof the opinion with the record as a whole, and the specializ ation of the treating\\nsource - in determining  what weig ht to g ive the opinion.  Id.\\n94\\n2.While the ALJ referenced the treating  physician opinion of [Dr. ***] , s/he did\\nnot comply  with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527, 416.927 by not providing  rationale\\nfor rejecting  that opinion.\\n3.While the ALJ relied on the claimant’s treati ng physician opinion [Dr. ***] ,\\nthe ALJ relied on portions of the opinion without explaining  why parts were\\nrejected. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that “[w]e will always give good\\nreasons in our notice of determination or decision for the weight we give your\\ntreating  source’s opinion.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c)(2), 416.927(c)(2)\\n(2017).\\n4.The ALJ did not obtain information from the claimant ’s treating  provider as\\nrequired by  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(e), 416.912(e).\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(e), 416.912(e)(2017) address the\\nneed for an ALJ to obtain information from a claimant’s own medical sources\\nand possibly  to order at least one consultative examination.  The provisions\\nstate:\\nWe may ask you to attend one or more consultative examinations at our\\nexpense.  See §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t for the rules governing  the\\nconsultative examination process.  Generally , we will not request a\\nconsultative examination until we have made every  reasonable effort to\\nobtain evidence from your own medical sources.  However, in some\\ninstances, such as when a source is known to be unable to provide certain\\ntests or procedures or is known to be nonproductive or uncooperative, we\\nmay order a consultative examination while awaiting  recei pt of medical\\nsource evidence. We will not evaluate this evidence until we have made\\nevery  reasonable effort to obtain evidence from y our medical sources.\\n5.The ALJ did not consider the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15257( c),\\n416.927(c) in evaluating  the opinion of the treating  physician.\\n6.The AL J did not specify  the weig ht given to the treating  physician opinion.\\nApplicable law:  Even if the ALJ does not find that a treating  physician’s\\nopinion is entitled to controlling  weig ht, s/he must consider the factors set\\nforth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(c), 416.927(c)(2017) in evaluating  any\\nmedical  source opinion and specify ing what lesser weig ht is being  assig ned. \\nThese factors are the length of treatment, frequ ency of examination, nature\\nand extent of the treatment relationship, support of opinion afforded  by\\nmedical evidence, consistency  of opinion  with the record as a whole, and\\nspecializ ation of the treating  physician.  Id.  Indeed, when evaluating  any\\nmedical source opinion – treating  or other wise, the ALJ is required to\\nconsider the factors listed in the reg ulations.  Id.\\n95\\n7.The AL J did not consider Dr. *** to be the claimant’s treating  physician.\\nApplicable law : 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1502, 416.902 (2017) provide:\\nGenerally , we will consider that you have an ongoing  treatment\\nrelationship with an acceptable medical source when the medical evidence\\nestablishes that you see, or have  seen, the source with a frequency\\nconsistent with accepted medical practice for the type of treatment and/or\\nevaluation required for your medical condition(s).  We may consider  an\\nacceptable medical  source who has treated or evaluated you only a few\\ntimes or only after long  intervals (e.g., twice a year) to be your treating\\nsource if the nature and frequency  of the treatment or evaluation is typical\\nfor y our condition(s).\\n8.The ALJ The ALJ did not provide proper weig ht to the opinio n of Dr. ***,\\nwho is a specialist in the impairment of which the claimant suffers.\\n9.The ALJ improperly  rejected the opinion of Dr. ***, the claimant’s primary\\ncare phy sician or treating  physician, because s/he is  not a specialist.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations specifically  provide that more weight  is\\ngenerally  accorded to speciali sts than to non-specialists.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1527(c)( 5), 416.927(c)(5) (2017) (“[w]e generally  give more weig ht to\\nthe opinion of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her area of\\nspecialty  than to the opinion of a source who is not a specialist”). However,\\nwhile the regulations recog nize that enhanced weig ht is accorded to\\nspeci alists, the fact that an individual is not a specialist is not a basis to\\ndiscredit a doctor’s opinions. Id.\\n10.The ALJ’s stated reason for rejecting the opinion of the claimant’s treating\\nphysician – that it was on an “issue reserved to the Comm issioner” – is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law: The regulations define an issue which is “reserved to the\\nCommissioner”  as an opinion that a claimant is “‘disabled’ or ‘unable to\\nwork.’”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15 27(d)(1), 416.927(d)(1) (2017).  The regulations\\ncertainly  envision treating sources providing  opinions on such issues as\\nwhether a claimant’s impairments meet or equal a listed impairment or a\\nclaimant’s functional limitations.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527(d )(2), 416.927(d)(2)\\n(2017). Indeed, the regulations specifically  provide that medical reports\\nshould contain, among  other thing s, a “statement about what you can still do\\ndespite your impairment(s) . . . .”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(b)(6), 416.913(b)(6)\\n(2017).\\n11.The ALJ erred in according  more weight to the consultative examining\\nopinion than that of the claimant’s treating  physician.\\nApplicable law: In the supplementary  material published with the regulations,\\n96\\nthe Commissioner expressly  stated that the treating  physician’s opinion will\\ngenerally  be g iven g reater weig ht than the opinion of a consultative phy sician:\\nAll thing s being  equal, when a treating  source has seen a claimant long\\nenoug h to have obtained a detailed long itudinal picture of the claimant’s\\nimpairment(s), we will alway s give greater weig ht to the treating  source’s\\nopinion than to the opinions of nontreating  sources even if the other\\nopinions are also reasonable or even if the treating  source’s opinion is\\ninconsistent with other substantial evidence of record.\\n56 F ed.

EVALUATION OF MEDICAL  EVIDENCE - CLAIMS FILED\\nON OR AFT ER MARCH  27, 2017\\n1.The ALJ erred in according “little, if any,” weig ht to the opinion of the\\nclaimant’s [nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant]  based on the fact that\\nthe source was not an acceptabl e medical source (“AMS”) because the ALJ\\ndid not consider that these providers are now AMSs whose opinions can\\nestablish the ex istence of medical impairments.\\nApplicable law:  Evidence from “acceptable medical sources” is used to\\nestablish the existence of a medically  determinable impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1521, 416.921.  SSA requires objective medical evidence from an AMS\\nto establish the existence of a medically  determinable impairment(s) at step\\ntwo of the sequential evaluation process and to establish that an individual’s\\nimpairment meets a Listing .  82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5845 (Jan. 18, 2017).  The\\nlist of acceptable medical sources, discussed  in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1502,\\n416.902, has been expanded and includes, apart from licensed phys icians and\\npsychologists :\\n(1) Licens ed optometrists for impairments of visual disorders, or\\nmeasurement of visual acuity  and visual fields only, depending  on the\\nscope of practice in the State in which the optometrists’ practice;\\n(2) Licensed podiatrists for impairments of the foot, or foot and ankle only,\\ndepending  on whether the State in which the podiatrists practice permits\\nthe practice of podiatry  on the foot only , or the foot and ankle;\\n(3) Qualified speech-language pathologists for speech or language\\nimpairments only. For this source, qualified means that the speech-\\nlanguage patholog ists must be licensed by the State professional\\nlicen sing agency , or be fully  certified by the State education agency  in\\n100\\nthe State in which they practice, or hold a Certif icate of Clinical\\nCompetence in Speech- Language Patholog y from the American Speech -\\nLanguage -Hearing  Association;\\n(4) Licensed audiolo gists for impairments of hearing  loss, auditory\\nprocessing  disorders, and balance  disorders within the licensed scope of\\npractice only ;\\n(5) Licensed Advanced Practice Registered Nurses , or other licensed\\nadvanced practice  nurses with another title, for impairments within their\\nlicensed scope of practice;24 or\\n(6) Licensed Physician Assis tants for impairments within their licensed\\nscope of practice.\\nSee also POMS DI 22505.003, Evidence from an Acceptable Medical Source\\n(AMS).\\n2.The ALJ erred in according  “little, if any,” weight to the opinion of the\\nclaimant’s “other medical sourc es” as such opinions must be considered in\\ndetermining  how the claimant’s impairment affects the ability  to work, in\\naccordance with 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529(a), (c)(3) 416.929(a), (c)(3).\\nApplicable law:  Evidence from “acceptable medical sources” (“AMS”) is\\nused to establish the existence of a medic ally determinable impairment .  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1521, 416.921.  Once an impairment is established,  then SSA\\ncan use evidence from acceptable medical sources, as well as evidence from\\nnon-medical sources, to establish the severity  of the impairment and how it\\naffects a claimant’s ability  to work.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(a)(c)(3)\\n416.929(a)(c)(3).   Which providers are considered AMSs is important because\\nonly AMSs can provide objective medical evidence that establishes the\\nexistence of a medically  determinable impairment.  However, the prefatory\\nmatter to the final rule does state that adjudicators will articulate “how they\\nconsider medical opinions from all medical sources, regardless of whether or\\nnot the medical source is an AMS in final 404.1520c and 416.920c.”  82 Fed.\\nReg. 5844, 5844 (J an. 18, 2017).\\n3.The ALJ erred in not providing  any reasons for his/her rejection of the\\nopinion of Dr. ***, who opined that the claimant [state limitation] , as the\\nregulations require articulation of how this opinion was considered.\\n4.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the opinion of the State Agency  Medical\\nConsultant, who opined that the claimant [state limitation] , as the regulations\\nrequire articulation of how this opinion was considered.\\n24 In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, SSA stated that this includes four types of medical sources –\\nCertified Nurse Midwife, Nurse Practitioner, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, and Clinical Nurse\\nSpecialist.  See  81 Fe d. Re g. 62560, 62568 ( Sept. 9, 2016) .\\n101\\nApplicable law.

Suppor tability: The more relevant the objective medical evidence and suppor ting explanations\\npresented by a medical source are to suppor t his or her medical opinion(s) or prior administrative\\nmedical finding(s), the more persuasive they will be.\\n2. Cons istency: The more consistent a medical opinion(s) or prior administrative medical\\nfinding(s) is with the evidence from other medical sources and nonmedical sources in the claim,\\nthe more persuasive they will be.\\n3. Relationship with the claimant :  Thi s factor combines consideration of these five issues: \\n (i) Length of the treatment relationship: The length of time a medical source has treated a\\nclaimant may help demonstrate whether the medical source has a longitudinal unde rstanding\\nof the claimant’s impairment(s).\\n (ii)Frequency of examinations: The frequency of a claimant’s visits with the medical source\\nmay help demonstrate whether the medical source has a longitudinal understanding of the\\nclaimant’s impairment(s).\\n (iii)Purpose of the treatment relationship: The purpose for treatment a claimant received from\\nthe medical source may help dem onstrate the level of knowledge the medical source has of\\nthe claimant’s impairment(s).  \\n (iv)Extent of the treatment relationship: The kinds and extent of examinations and testing the\\nmedical source has performed or ordered from specialists or independent laboratories may\\nhelp demonstrate the level of knowledge the medical source has of a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s). \\n(v)Examining relationship: A medical source may have a better unde rstanding of a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s) if he or she examines the claimant than if the medical source only reviews\\nevidence in the folder. \\n4. Specialization: The medical opinion or prior administrative medical finding of a medical source\\nwho has received advanced education and training to become a specialist may be more\\npersuasive about medical issues related to his or her area of specialty than the medical opinion\\nor prior administrative medical finding of a medical source who is not a specialist in the relevant\\narea of specialty.\\n5. Other factors: We will consider other factors that tend to suppor t or contradict a medical\\nopinion or prior administrative medical finding.  This includes, but is not limited to, evidence\\nshowing a medical source has familiarity with the other evidence in the claim or an\\nunde rstanding of our disability program’s policies and evidentiary requirements.  Whe n we\\nconsider a medical source’s familiarity with the other evidence in a claim, we will also consider\\nwhether new evidence we receive after the medical source made his or her medical opinion or\\nprior administrative medical finding makes the medical opinion or prior administrative medical\\nfinding more or less persuasive.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c (c), 416.920c (c).  For guidance, see POMS DI 24503.025, Evaluating Medical\\nOpinions and Pr ior Adm inistrative Medical Findings. \\n103\\nIn the comments to the final regulations, SSA explains that the articula tion of\\nsupportability  and consistency  factors:\\ngenerally  includes an assessment of the supporting  objective medical\\nevidence and other medical evidence, and how consistent the medical\\nopinion or prior administrative medical finding s is with the other\\nevidence in the claim.\\n82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5859 (J an. 18, 2017).\\nThe comments also emphasiz e that there is not an inherent persuasiveness to\\nevidence from medical sources , psycholog ical sources, or consultative\\nexaminers over an individual’s own medical sources , and vice versa, and\\n“highlight that we continue to consider a medical source’s long standing\\ntreatment relationship with the individual.”  82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5844 (Jan. 17,\\n2017).  Moreover:\\nthe final rules in 404.1520c(c)(3) and 416.920c(c)(3) retain the\\nrelationship between the medical source and the claimant as one of the\\nfactors we consider as we evaluate the persuasiveness of a medical\\nopinio n.  These final rules also continue to allow an adjudicator to\\nconsider an individual’s own medical source’s medical opinion to be the\\nmost persuasive medical opinion if it is both supported by relevant\\nobjective medical evidence and the source’s explana tion, and is\\nconsistent with other evidence, as described in final 404.1520c  and\\n416.920c.\\n82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5853 (J an. 18, 2017).\\n7.In finding  that the opinion of Dr. ***, the claimant’s longtime treating\\nphysician, was not persuasive, the ALJ improperly  focused on isolated\\nstatements in the prog ress notes indicating  improvement and did not consider\\nthe evidence as a whole.\\nApplicable law.  The final rules recog nize that “evidenc e from a medical\\nsource who has a long standing  treatment relationship with an individual may\\ncontain some inconsistencies over time due to fluctuations in the severity of\\nan individual’s impairments.”  82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5857 (J an. 17, 2017).\\n8.As the medical opinions of record are equally well-supported and consistent\\nwith the record, the ALJ erred in not addressi ng all of the regulatory  factors as\\nrequired.\\n9.As every  medical provider who addressed the issue agreed that [the claimant’s\\nmental impairment is a severe  impairment or the claimant has reaching\\nlimitations, etc.]  the ALJ erred in not addressing  all of the regulatory  factors\\nas required.\\n104\\nApplicable law.  In cases where two or more differing  medical opinions  or\\nprior administrative medical finding s about the same issue are equally  well-\\nsupported and consistent with the record, but are “not exactly  the same, we\\nwill articulate how we considered the othe r most persuasive factors in\\nparag raphs (c)(3) throug h (c)(5) of this section for those medical opinions or\\nprior administrative medical finding s in your determination or decision.”  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(b)(3), 416.920c(b)(3).\\nThe regulatory  factors for assessing  medical opinions and prior adminis trative\\nfinding s(s) are as follows:\\n(1) Supportability .  “The more relevant the objective medical evidence and\\nsupporting  explanations presented by a medical  source are to support his\\nor her medical opinion(s) or prior admi nistrative medical finding (s), the\\nmore persuasive the medical opinions or prior administrative med ical\\nfinding (s) will be.”  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(1), 416.920c(c)(1).\\n(2) Consistency .  “The more consistent a medical opinion(s) or prior\\nadministrative medical finding( s) is with the evidence from other medical\\nsources and non-medical sources in the claim, the more persuasive the\\nmedical opinion(s) or prior administrative medical finding(s) will be.  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(2), 416.920c(c)(2).\\n(3) Relationship with the claimant.  This factor includes the length of the\\ntreatment relationship and the frequency of examination , which both\\n“may  help demonstrate whether the medical source has a long itudinal\\nunderstanding  of your impairment(s)”;  the purpose of the treatment\\nrelati onship which may “help demonstrate the level of knowledg e the\\nmedical source has of your impairment(s)”; the extent of the treatment\\nrelationship , which recog nizes that the “kinds and extent of examinations\\nand testing  the medical sour ce has performed or ordered from specialists\\nor indep endent laboratories may help demonstrate the level of knowledg e\\nthe medical source has of your impairment(s)”; and the examining\\nrelationship , as a “medical source may have a better understanding  of\\nyour impairment(s) if he or she examines you than if the medical sour ce\\nonly  reviews evidence in your folder.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(3)(i)-\\n(v), 416.920c(c)(3)(i)-(v).\\n(4) Specialization .  “The medical opinion or prior administrative medical\\nfinding  of a medical source who has received advanced education and\\ntraining  to become a specialist may be more persuasive about medical\\nissues related to his or her area of specialty  than the medical opinion or\\nprior administrative medical finding  of a medical sourc e who is not a\\nspecialist in the relevant area of specialty .”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520c(c)(4), 416.920c(c)(4).\\n(5) Other factors .  “We will consider other factors that tend to support or\\ncontradic t a medical opinion or prior administrative medical finding . \\n105\\nThis includes, but is not limited to, evidence showing  a medical  source\\nhas familiarity  with the other evidence in the claim or an understanding\\nof our disability  prog ram’s policies and evident iary requirements.  When\\nwe consider a medical source’s familiarity  with the other evidence in a\\nclaim, we will also consider whether new evidence we receive after the\\nmedical source made his or her medical opinion or prior administrative\\nmedical finding  makes the medical opinion or prior administrative\\nmedical finding  more or less persuasive.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c(c)(5),\\n416.920c(c)(5).\\n10.The ALJ’s finding  that the opinion of the State Agency  Medical Consultant, is\\nthe most persuasive is not based on substantial evidence as, in addition to\\nnever having examined or treated the claimant, the consultant never had the\\nopport unity to review over *** pages of medical evidence added to the record\\nsince the case was reviewed, which included key medical evidence such as\\n[MRI  evidence of hospitaliz ation, or an evaluation by  a specialist, etc.] .\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in evaluat ing medical opinions,\\nthe adjudicator can consider “evidence showing  a medical source has\\nfamiliarity  with the other evidence in the claim or an understanding  of our\\ndisability  progr am’s policies and evidentiary  requirements.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1420c(c)(5), 416.920c(c)(5).  The regulations further provide that in\\nconsidering  a “medical source’s familiarity with the other evidence in a claim,\\nwe will also consider whether new evidence we receive after the medical\\nsource made his or her medical opinion or prior administrative medical\\nfinding  makes the medical opinion or prior administrative medica l finding\\nmore or less persuasive.”  Id.\\n11.The ALJ erred in not considering  and addressing  evidence from a nonmedical\\nsource [i.e., a third- party statement from a family  member, friend, etc., an\\nemploy er’s statement, etc.] .\\nApplicable law:  The regulations set forth four categ ories of evidence –(1)\\nobjective medical evidence ; (2) medical opinion; (3) other medical evidence;\\nand (4) evidence from nonmedical sources.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513, 416.9 13. \\nThe last categ ory, “evidence from nonmedical sources,” is “any  information\\nor statement(s) from a nonmedical sources (including  you) about any issue in\\nyour claim” which may come from the “nonmedical sources either directl y”\\nor “indirectly , such as from forms we receive and our administr ative records. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(a)(4), 416.913(a)(4) .  Nonmedical sources are defined\\nas sources that are not medical sources, including  the claimant, educational\\nperson nel (such as teachers, counselors, early  intervention team members,\\ndevelo pmental center workers, and daycare center workers), public and\\nprivate social welfare agency  personnel and family  members, caregi vers,\\nfriends, neig hbors, employ ers, and clerg y.  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1502, 416.902.\\nIn comments to the new rules, SSA explained that “[o]ur adjudicators will\\ncontinue to assess an individual’s ability  to function under these final rules\\n106\\nusing  evidence we receive from all sources, including  nonmedical sources.” \\n82 F ed. Reg . 5844, 5850 (J une 19, 2017).\\n12.The ALJ’s finding  that the opinion of Dr. ***, the claimant’s treating\\nphysician, addressed an “issue reserved to the Commissi oner” is not\\nsupporte d by substantial evidence, as this opinion included a detailed opinion\\nregarding  the claimant’s functional limitations.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that statements on issues reserved\\nto the Commissioner include the followi ng:  (1) statements that a claimant is\\nor is not disabled, blind, able to work or able to perform regular or continuing\\nwork; (2) statements regarding  whether a claimant has a severe impairment;\\n(3) statements regarding  whether or not an impairment meets the duration\\nrequirement; (4) statements regarding  whether an impairment meets or equals\\na listed impairment; (5) statements “about what your [RFC] is using our\\nprog rammatic terms about functio n exertional levels . . .”; (6) statements\\nabout whether the claimant’s RFC preven ts performing  his or her past\\nrelevant work; (7) statements that a claimant does or does not meet a Grid\\nRule; and (8) statements about whether the claimant’s disability  ends or\\ncontinues in termination cases.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(c)(3),\\n416.920b(c)(3).  Adjudicators are no longer required to articulate how they\\nconsider statements on such issues.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(c), 416.920b (c)\\n(“we will not provide any analy sis about how we considered such evidence in\\nour determination or decision . . .).\\nHowever , as noted in the comments to the final regulations, SSA stated that\\nthe agency “will not consider an entire document to be a statement on an issue\\nto the Commissioner simply  because the document contains a statement on an\\nissue that is reserved to the Commissioner.”  82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5831 (Jan.\\n18, 2017).\\nD. EVALUATION OF PAIN AND O THER SUB JECTIVE\\nSYMPTOMS\\n1.While the ALJ cited SSR 16-3p, s/he never actually  explained how the\\nstandard was applied to the facts and circumstances of this case.\\nApplic able law:  SSR 16-3p requires that the ALJ first consider whether there\\nis an underly ing medically  determinable impairment that could reasonably  be\\nexpected to produce the claimant’s symptoms.  The ALJ must then consider\\nwhether the condition could reasonably  be expected to produce the\\nindividual’s symptoms and must evaluate the intensity , persistence, or\\nfunctionally  limiting  effects of these sy mptoms.\\nWith regard to the latter evaluation,  the ALJ must use all of the evidence and\\nmust consid er certain factors, such as daily  activities; the location, frequency ,\\nand intensity  of pain or other symptoms; factors that precipitate and aggravate\\n107\\nsymptoms; treatment; any measures other than treatment taken to relieve\\nsymptoms; and any othe r factors concerning  the individual’s functional\\nlimitations and restrictions.  The Ruling  requires that the ALJ “discuss the\\nfactors pertinen t to the evidence of record” whereas a factor will not be\\ndiscussed “[i]f there is no information in the evidence of record regarding ” it. \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529, 416.929.\\nSSR 16-3p also “explains that we will consider  symptoms and functional\\nlimitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the objective\\nmedical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinable\\nimpairment]  or combination of impairments that meets our duration\\nrequirement.”  Id.  SSR 16-3p also clarifies that an individual’s symptoms\\nalone are not enoug h to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled\\nbased on alleg ed symptoms alone.”  Id.  See also 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1569a,\\n416.969a (symptoms can cause exertional or nonex ertional limitations, or\\nboth).\\n 2.The ALJ improperly  focused on the need for objective evidence in evaluating\\nthe claimant’s subjective complaints.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p does not permit an ALJ to unfavorably  evaluate\\nan individual’s symptoms based solely  on objective medical evidence.  It\\nrecog nizes symptoms cannot alway s be measured objectively , and they may\\nnot be disreg arded solely  because they are not substantiated by objective\\nmedical evidence.  Indeed, “individuals with the same medical impairment s,\\nthe same objective medical evidence, and the same non-medical evidence”\\nmay have different limitations.  Likewise, minimal or negative finding s, or\\ninconsistencies in the objective medical evidence, are just “one of the many\\nfactors” that must be considered.  The Ruling  provides that “[w]e will explain\\nwhich of an individual’s symptoms we found consistent or inconsistent with\\nthe evidence in his or her record and how our evaluation of the individual’s\\nsymptoms led to our conclusions.”\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 16-3p in focusing  on the claimant’s  overall\\ncredibility  instead of his or her sy mptoms, as required.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p, which rescin ded SSR 96-7p and eliminated use\\nof the term “credibility ,” states that the Administration “will more closely\\nfollow our regulatory  lang uage regarding  symptom evaluation.”  Instead of\\nfocusing  on credibili ty, the Ruling  refers to whether symptoms are more or\\nless “likely  to reduce” an individual’s capacities.  SSR 16-3p requires that the\\nALJ first consider whether there is an underly ing medically  determina ble\\nimpairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant’s\\nalleg ed symptoms.  The ALJ must then evaluate the intensity , persistence, or\\nfunctionally  limiting  effects of these sy mptoms.\\n108\\n4.The language of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with SSR 16-3p or\\nHAL LEX I-2-8-25(A) as the ALJ used [emotionally  charged words,\\ndisapproving  or derog atory  terms, or personal judgments or opinions; or used\\nthe decision as a forum to criticiz e the claimant] .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p mandates that adjudicators “must limit their\\nevaluation to the individual statements about his or her symptoms and the\\nevidence in the record that is relevant to an individual’s impairments.”  In\\nperforming  this evaluation, “our adjudicators will not assess an individual’s\\noverall character or truthfulness in the manner typical ly used during  an\\nadversarial court litigation.  The focus of the evaluation of an individual’s\\nsymptoms should not be to determine whether he or she is a truthful person.”\\nHAL LEX I-2-8-25(A) warns that if the record contains “evide nce that is\\npotentially  detrimental to a claimant’s health, the ALJ will take care when\\nwriting  the decision not to unnecessarily  upset or harm the claimant with the\\ndiscussion of this evidence.”  Further, in the written decision, “an ALJ will\\nnot use: Emotionally  charg ed words, disapproving  or derog atory  terms, or\\npersonal judgments or opini ons” or use the “decision as a forum for\\ncriticiz ing… the claimant.”\\n5.The ALJ erred in not considering  the fluctu ation or variance of the claimant’s\\nsymptoms over time.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p recog nizes that symptoms may vary in their\\nintensity , persistence and functional effects and may worsen or improve may\\ntime.  For this reason, “inconsistencies in an individual’s statements made at\\nvarying times does not necessarily  mean they  are inaccurate.”\\n6.The ALJ did not consider all of the factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3) for evaluating  subjective complaints.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations set forth the following factors which are to\\nbe considered in evaluating  a claimant’s subjective complaints:\\n(1) Your daily  activities;\\n(2) The location, duration, frequency , and inten sity of your pain or other\\nsymptoms;\\n(3) Precipitating  and ag gravating  factors;\\n(4) The type, dosag e, effectiven ess, and side effects of any medication you\\ntake or have taken to alleviate y our pain or other sy mptoms;\\n(5) Treatment, other than medication, you receive or have received for relief\\nof your pain or other sy mptoms;\\n(6) Any measures you use or have used to relieve your pain or other\\nsymptoms (e.g., lying flat on your back, standing  for 15 to 20 minutes\\nevery  hour, sleeping  on a board, etc.); and\\n(7) Other factors concerning  your functional limitations and restrictions due\\nto pain or other sy mptoms.\\n109\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3).  However, Social Security  Ruling\\n16-3p requires that the ALJ “discuss the factors pertinent to the evidence of\\nrecord” whereas a factor will not be discussed “[i]f there is no information in\\nthe evidence of record reg arding ” it.\\n7.The ALJ did not discuss the side effects from the claimant’s medicati ons on\\nhis/her ability  to work, as required under SSR 16-3p.\\n8.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant did not alleg e any side effects from\\nhis/her medications is not based on substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 16-3p specifically  requires consideration of the “type,\\ndosag e, effectiveness, and side effects of any medication the individu al takes\\nor has taken to alleviate pain or other symptoms.”  See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1529(c)(3)(iv), 416.929(c)(3)(iv) (same).  Side effects of medications are\\nalso relevant in determining  a claimant’s RFC.  According  to SSR 96-8p, the\\nRFC assessment “must be based on all of the relevant evidence in the case\\nrecord,” including  “the effects of treatment, including  limitations or\\nrestrictions imposed by the mechanics of treatment (e.g., frequency  of\\ntreatment, duration, disruption to routine, side effects of medication).”\\nSocial Security  Ruling  03-2p, addressing  reflex sympathetic dystrophy ,\"\n",

      "  \"context\": \"Social Security  Ruling  03-2p, addressing  reflex sympathetic dystrophy ,\\ndiscusses the side effects of medications taken to treat chronic pain:\\nChronic pain and many  of the medic ations prescribed to treat it may\\naffect an individual’s ability  to maintain attention and concentration, as\\nwell as adversely  affect his or her cognition, mood, and behavior, and\\nmay even reduce motor reaction times.  These factors can interfere with\\nan individual’s ability  to sustain work activity  over time, or preclude\\nsustained work activity  altog ether.  When evaluating  duration and\\nseverity , as well as when evaluating  RFC, the effects of chronic pain and\\nthe use of pain medications must be carefully  considered.\\n9.While the ALJ summariz ed the claimant’s testimony , s/he erred in not\\nproviding  specific ration ale for rejecting  this testimony , as required by SSR\\n16-3p.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 16-3p states that:\\nIn evaluating  an individual’s symptoms, it is not sufficient for our\\nadjudicators to make a single, conclusory  statement that “the individual’s\\nstatements about his or her symptoms have been considered” or that “the\\nstate ments about the individual’s symptoms are (or are not) supported or\\nconsistent.”  It is also not enoug h for our adjudicators simply  to recite the\\nfactors described in the reg ulations for evaluating  symptoms.\\nRather, SSR 16-3p requires that the decision contain “contain specific reasons\\nfor the weight given to the individual’s symptoms, be consistent with and\\n110\\nsupported by the evidence, and be clearly  articulated so the individu al and any\\nsubsequent reviewer can assess how the adjudicator evaluated the individual’s\\nsymptoms.”\\n10.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the State Agency  Medical Consultants’\\nfinding s that the claimant was credible.\\nApplicable law:  The State Agency  Medical Consultant, specifically  opined\\nthat the claimant’s symptoms were “full y credible.”  Social Security  Ruling\\n16-3p requires an ALJ to consider finding s from State agency medical and\\npsycholog ical sources about the existence and severity  of an individual’s\\nimpairment(s), including  the existence and severity of any symptoms and\\nprovides as follows:\\nMedical evidence from medical sources that have not treated or examined\\nthe individual is also important in the adjudicator’s evaluation of an\\nindividual’s statements about pain or other symptom s.  For example,\\nState agency  medical and psycholog ical consultants and other prog ram\\nphysicians and psycholog ists may offer findings about the existence and\\nseverity  of an individual’s symptoms .  We will consider these findings in\\nevaluating  the intensity , persistence, and limiting  effects of the\\nindividual’s symptoms.  Adjudicators at the hearing  level or at the\\nAppe als Council level must consider the finding s from these medical\\nsources even thoug h they  are not bound by  them.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n11.The ALJ did not consider the claimant’s persistent efforts to obtain pain relief\\nfor his/her sy mptoms as addressed in SSR 16-3p.\\nApplicab le law:  Social Security  Ruling  16-3p recog nizes that a claimant’s\\npersistent efforts to obtain relief from his/her pain or other symptoms may\\nsupport the intensity  and persistence of sy mptoms:\\nPersistent attempts to obtain relief of symptoms, such as increasing\\ndosag es and chan ging medications, trying a variety  of treatments,\\nreferrals to specialists, or chang ing treatment sources may be an\\nindication that an individual’s symptoms are a source of distr ess and may\\nshow that they  are intense and persistent.\\n12.The ALJ did not comply  with the regulations in not addressing  various\\nwitness statements in the record describing  the claimant’s limitations.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide for consideration of “all of the\\nevidence presented, including  inform ation about your prior work record, your\\nstatements about your symptoms, evidence submitted by your medical\\nsources, and observations by our employ ees and other persons.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n111\\n404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3).\\n13.The ALJ did not comply  with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529, 416.929 in evaluating\\nthe claimant’s subjective symptoms as s/he did not consider the “observations\\nby our employ ees,” as required.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3)  states that “[w]e\\nwill consider all of the evidence presented, including  information about your\\nprior work record, your statements about your symptoms, evidence submitted\\nby your medical sources, and observations by our employ ees and other\\npersons.”\\nE.EFFECT OF OPINIO NS O F OTHER AG ENCIES REGARDING\\nDISAB ILITY\\n1.The ALJ committed legal error in not consi dering and addressing  the\\nunderly ing and supporting  evidence which supported the [VA’s or workers\\ncompensation or State disability  agency ] finding  of disability .\\nApplicable law:  Determinations by other governmental and non-\\ngovernmental agencies, such as the Departm ent of Veterans Affairs, the\\nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel\\nManag ement, State agencies, and private insurers including workers\\ncompensation providers are not binding  on SSA.  As set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1504, 416.904: “[b]ecause a decision by any other governmental agency\\nor a non-g overnmental entity about whether you are disabled, blind ,\\nemploy able, or entitled to any benefits is based on its rules and is not binding\\non us and is not our decision about whether you are disabled or blind under\\nour rules.”  Thus, SSA will not “provide any analy sis” of such a\\ndetermination.  Id.  Howeve r, SSA “will consider all of the supporting\\nevidence underly ing the other governmental agency  or nong overnmental\\nentity ’s decision that we receive evidence in your claim in accordance with §\\n404.1513(a)(1) throug h (4).”  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1504, 416.904.\\n2.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant’s receipt of unemploy ment benefits\\nautomatically  bars his/her application for Social Security  benefits.\\nApplicable law:  While an ALJ may consider the receipt of unemploy ment\\nbenefits and the surrounding  circumstances, an application for disability  may\\nnot be denied solely  on the ground that the applicant received unemploy ment\\nbenefits.  SSR 00-1c, which was based on the Supreme Court ’s decision in\\nCleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795 (1999), held there was no\\ninherent conflict between claims for disability  insurance benefits and claims\\nunder the American with Disabilities Act.  \\nIn a memorandum from Frank Cristaudo, Chief Administrative Law Judge,\\n112\\ndated August 9, 2010,26 he expressed SSA’s policy  regarding SSR 00-1c’s\\napplication to unemploy ment benefits:\\nThis is a reminder of the polic y concerning receipt of unemploy ment\\ninsurance benefits.  Receipt of unemploy ment benefits does not preclude\\nthe receipt of Social Security  benefits. The receipt of unemploy ment\\nbenefits is only one of many  factors that must be considered in\\ndetermining  whether the claimant is disabled.  See 20 C.F.R. 404.1512(b)\\nand 416.912(b).\\nIn considering  claims of individuals who have applied for unempl oyment\\nbenefits, Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) should be mindful of the\\nprinciples discussed in Social Security  Ruling 00-1c, which incorporates\\nCleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp. , 526 U.S. 795 (1999).  In that\\ncase, the Supreme Court held, in a unanimous decision, that a claim for Social\\nSecurity disability  benefits is often consistent with a claim for relief under the\\nAmerican with Disabilities Act (ADA) even thoug h there must be an inability\\nto work in order to obtain relief under the ADA. . . .\\nIn addition, it is often uncertain whet her we will find a person who applies for\\nunemploy ment benefits ultimately  to be disabled under our rules, and our\\ndecision maki ng process can be quite lengthy.  Therefore, it is SSA’s position\\nthat individuals need not choose between apply ing for unemploy ment\\ninsurance and Social Security  benefits.\\nThe Memorandum goes on to state that an “application for unemploy ment\\nbenefits is evidence that the ALJ must consider together with all of the\\nmedical and other evidence” and that “ALJs should look at the totality  of\\ncircumstances in determining the significance of the application for\\nunemploy ment benefits and related efforts to obtain employ ment.”\\nPursuant to 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(b), 416.912(b) a claimant must prove\\ndisability  by evidence that includes, for ex ample,\\n(3) [s]tatements you or others make about your impairment(s), your\\nrestrictions, your daily  activities, your efforts to work, or any other\\nrelevant statements . . .; or\\n(4) [i]nformation from other sources, as described in §404.1513(d).\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(b)(3) &  (4), 416.912(3) &  (4) (emphasis added).\\nHowever, before  making  such an argument, it is recommended that you verify\\nthat the State at issue does not prohibit the application for or receipt of both\\nSocial Security  benefits and unemploy ment benefits.  It is also recommended\\nthat you verify  the information provided by the claimant in the applicati on for\\nunemploy ment benefits, or the requirements to receive unemploy ment\\n26 A copy of this Memorandum  is in Part II, Document #5, infra. \\n113\\nbenefits.  See also SSR 13-1p, which notes that alleg ations of ALJ bias\\nagainst claimants who receive unemploy ment bene fits, among  other\\nexamples, will be referred by the Appeals Council to the Division of Quality\\nService.\\nF. FAIL URE TO FOLLOW PRESCRIB ED TREATMENT  \\n1.The ALJ erred in evaluating  the claimant’s subjective complaints by focusing\\non his/her failure to obtain treatment without first making  a good cause\\ndetermination about the claimant’s reasons for the lack of treatment or not\\nfollowing  prescribed treatment pursuant to SSR 16-3p and/or SSR 18-3p.\\n2.The ALJ erred in relying on the claimant’s failure to take prescri ption\\nmedication as a basis for rejecting his/her complaints of pain since the\\nclaimant established good cause pursuant to SSR  16-3p and/or 18-3p for not\\ntaking  such medications.\\n3.The ALJ erred in not apply ing SSR 16-3p that requires the ALJ to consider\\n“possibl e reasons he or she may not comply  with treatment or seek treatment\\nconsistent with the deg ree of his or her complaints.”\\n4.The AL J did not comply  with SSR 18-3p in finding  that the claimant was non-\\ncompliant with prescribed treatment.\\n5.The ALJ did not consider if the claimant “is unable to afford prescribed\\ntreatment, which he or she is willing  to follow, but for which affordable or\\nfree community  resources are unavailable,” as ex plained in SSR 18-3p.\\n6.The ALJ failed to consider if the claimant has a psychiatric impairment that\\nprovides good cause for the lack of treatment, as explained in HAL LEX II-5-\\n3-1.\\nApplicable law: SSR 16-3p provides that the ALJ must not draw any\\ninferences about a claimant’s symptoms and their functional effects from a\\nfailure to seek or follow proportional medical treatment without first\\nconsidering  any explanations that the claimant may provide, or other\\ninformation in the record, that may explain the infrequent or irreg ular medical\\nvisits or failure to comply  with recommended medical treatment.  SSR 16-3p\\nfurther provides that the ALJ may need to reconta ct the claimant or question\\nthe claimant at the hearing  to obtain such informat ion.  The Ruling  lists\\nvarious factors that may provide an explanation for the noncompliance or\\nlimited treatment.\\nSSR 16-3p sets forth specific examples of valid reason s for not obtaining\\ntreatment, including  the following :\\n•An individual may have structured his or her activities to minimiz e\\nsymptoms to a tolerable level  by avoiding  physical activities or mental\\n114\\nstressors that ag gravate his or her sy mptoms.\\n•An individual may receive period ic treatment or evaluation for refills\\nof medications because his or her sy mptoms have reached a plateau.\\n•An individual may not agree to take prescription medications because\\nthe side effects are less tolerable than the sy mptoms.\\n•An individual may not be able to afford treatment and may not have\\naccess to free or low-cost medical services.\\n•A medical source may have advised the individual that there is no\\nfurther effective treatment to prescribe or recommend that would\\nbenefit the individual.\\n•An individual’s symptoms may not be severe enoug h to prompt him or\\nher to seek treatment, or the sympto ms may be relieved with over the\\ncounter medications.\\n•An individual’s relig ious beliefs may  prohibit prescribed treatment.\\n•Due to various limitations (such as language or mental limitations), an\\nindividual may not understand the appropriate treatment for or the\\nneed for consistent treatment of his or her impairment.\\n•Due to a mental impairment (for example, individuals with mental\\nimpairments that affect judg ment, reality  testing , or orientation), an\\nindividual may not be aware that s/he has a disorder that requires\\ntreatment.\\n•A child may disreg ard the level and frequency  of treatment needed to\\nmaintain or improve functioning  because it interferes with his or her\\nparticipation in activities typical of other children his or her age\\nwithout impairments.\\nIn addition, a psychiatric impairment may provide good cause for not\\npursuing  treatment. HAL LEX II-5-3-1, Good Cause for Failure to Follow\\nPrescribe’ Treatment, provides that:\\nthe existence of a psychiatric impairme nt may provide good cause for a\\nclaimant’s failure to follow prescribed treatment. For example, we may\\nbe able to find good cause for failure to follow prescribed treatment in a\\ncase where the evidence shows that the claimant has paranoid\\nschiz ophrenia with symptoms including  a highly organized delusional\\nsystem that leads him or her to believe that people are attempting  to\\npoison him or her and that medication prescribed by a physician is part of\\nthe poisoning  ‘plot’ . . . . If a claimant has a psychiatric impairment and\\n115\\nhis or her refusal to follow prescribed treatment is based on that\\nimpairment or that impairment and a combination of other impairments,\\nthe Appeals Council may find that such impairme nt is good cause for not\\nfollowing  prescribed treatment.\\nSSR 16-3p further provides that the ALJ “will consider and address reasons\\nfor not pursui ng treatment that are pertinent to an individual’s case” and “will\\nexplain how” the reasons were considered in the “evaluation of the\\nindividual’s sy mptoms.”\\nThe regulations provide that “[i]n order to get benefits, you must follow\\ntreatment prescribed by your physician if this treatment can restore your\\nability  to work” and “[i]f you do not follow the prescribed treatment without a\\ngood reason, we will not find you disabled or, if you are already  receiving\\nbenefits, we will stop pay ing you benefits.” 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1530, 416.930.  \\nSSR 18-3p replaced SSR 82-59 to provide guidance on how SSA applies the\\nfailure to follow prescribed treatment policy  in disabili ty and blindness\\nclaims.  The policy  applies if three conditions are met: \\n(1) The person would otherwise be entitled to benefits or blindness benefits;\\n(2) There is evidence  that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed\\ntreatment for the medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the\\ndisability  finding  is based; and\\n(3) There is evidence that the individ ual did not follow the prescribed\\ntreatment.\\nIf all three condit ions exist, SSA then determines whether the individual\\nfailed to follow prescribed treatment based on either:\\n(1) Whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would be ex pected to\\nrestore the individual’s ability  to eng age in substantial g ainful activity\\n(SGA); or\\n(2) Whether the individual has good cause for not following the prescribed\\ntreatment. \\nIn adult claims, the individual has the burden to provide evidence showing\\nthat he or she has good cause for failing  to follow prescribed  treatment.  In\\nchild claims, the burden rests with the parent or guardian to show that the\\nchild has good cause.  Examples of acceptable good cause reasons, which\\nclaimants bear the burden of providing  evidence to show, include reasons\\nrelating  to religion, cost, incapacity , medical disag reement, psychiatric\\nimpairment which causes fear of treatment, intense fear of surgery, prior\\nhistory  of unsuccessful surgery, high risk of loss of life or limb, surgeries with\\nrisk of death, some cataract surgeries, amputation of an extremity , and\\naddiction to opioid medication and other reasons, determined on a case-by -\\n116\\ncase basis.27   \\n27 The  following are examples of acceptable good cause reasons for not following prescribed treatment:\\nReligion: The established teaching and tenets of the individual’s religion prohibit him or her from\\nfollowing the prescribed treatment. The individual must identify the religion, provide evidence of the\\nindividual’s membership in or affiliation to his or her religion, and provide evidence that the\\nreligion’s teachings do not permit the individual to follow the prescribed treatment.\\nCost: The individual is unable to afford prescribed treatment, which he or she is willing to follow,\\nbut for which affordable or free community resources are unav ailable. Some individuals can obtain\\nfree or subsidized health insurance plans or healthcare from a clinic or other provider. In these\\ninstances, the individual must demonstrate why he or she does not have health insurance that pays\\nfor the prescribed treatment or why he or she failed to obtain treatment at the free or subsidized\\nhealthcare provider.\\nIncapaci ty: The individual is unable to unde rstand the consequences of failing to follow prescribed\\ntreatment.\\nMedical disagreement: Whe n the individual’s own medical sources disagree about whether the\\nindividual should follow a prescribed treatment, the individual has good cause to not follow the\\nprescribed treatment. Similarly, when an individual chooses to follow one kind of treatment\\nprescribed by one medical source to the simultaneous exclusion of an alternate treatment prescribed\\nby another medical source, the individual has good cause not to follow the alternate treatment.\\nIntense fear of surgery: The individual’s fear of surgery is so intense that it is a contraindication\\nto having the surgery. We require a written statemen t from an individual’s own medical source\\naffirming that the individual’s intense fear of surgery is in fact a contraindication to having the\\nsurgery. We will not consider an individual’s refusal of surgery as good cause for failing to follow\\nprescribed treatment if it is based on the individual’s assertion that success is not guaranteed or that\\nthe individual knows of someone else for whom the treatment was not successful.\\nPrior history: The individual previously had major surgery for the same impairment with\\nunsuccessful results and the same or similar additional major surgery is now prescribed.\\nHigh risk of loss of life or limb: The treatmen t involves a high risk for loss of life or limb.\\nTreatments in this category include:\\nSurgeries with a ri sk of death, such as open-heart surgery or organ transplant.\\nCataract surgery in one eye with a documented, unus ually high-risk of serious surgical\\ncomplications when the individual also has a severe visual impairment of the other eye that cannot\\nbe improved through treatment.\\nAmputation o f an extremity or a major part of an extremity.\\nRisk of addi ction to opioid medication: The  prescribed treatment is for opioid medication.\\nOther: If the individual offers another reason for failing to follow prescribed treatment, we will\\ndetermine whether it is reasonably justified on a case-by- case basis.”\\nSSR 18- 3p.\\n117\\n7.The AL J erred in deny ing the claim based on the claimant’s failure to follow\\ntreatment as a listing  was satisfied in this case. \\nApplicable law:  With regard to step 3 of the sequential evaluation process,\\nSSR 18-3p explains that there  are two situations where no failure to follow\\nprescribed treatment determination will be made even if there is evidence that\\nan individual failed to follow prescribed treatment.  First, “when we find the\\nindividual disabled based on a listing  that requires only the presence of\\nlaboratory  finding s” and second, where  “the individual is disabled based on a\\nlisted impairment(s) which requires” consideration of “whether the individua l\\nwas following  that specific treatment as part of the required listing  analysis.” \\nThe Rulin g also discusses how child claims are handled in cases where there\\nis a potential failure to follow prescribed treatment, and explains that the same\\nexceptions just described apply  equally  to these claims. \\n8.The ALJ improperly  discredited the claimant based on lifest yle recommenda-\\ntions, such as dieting , exercise, or smoking  cessation. \\nSSR 18-3p defines prescribed treatment means any medication, surgery,\\ntherapy , use of durable medical equipmen t, or use of assistive devices. \\nPrescribed treatment does not include lifesty le modifications, such as dieting,\\nexercise, or smoking  cessation. \\n9.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 18-3p in relying on the opinion  of a\\ncons ultative physician as a basis for the finding  that the claimant did not\\nfollow prescribed treatment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 18-3p provides that the treatme nt must have been\\nprescrib ed by one of the claimant’s own medical sources.  Therefore, the\\nRuling  explains, the agency  will not find a failure “to follow prescribed\\ntreatment if the treatment was prescribed only by a consultative examiner\\n(CE), medical consultant (MC), psycholog ical consultant (PC),  medical expert\\n(ME), or by a medical source during  an evaluation conducted solely  to\\ndetermine elig ibility  to any  State or F ederal benefit.”  \\nG.ONSET DAT E\\n1.In light of the new evidence documenting  that SSA found the claimant\\ndisabled based on a subsequent application, the Appeals Council  should\\nremand this case with instructions to consider the onset date of his/her\\ndisability .\\n2.The ALJ committed reversible error in not providing  weig ht to a physician’s\\nretrospective opinion of the onset of the claimant’s condition.\\nApplicab le law:  Social Security  Ruling  18-01p, which along  with SSR 18-\\n02p replaced SSR 83-20, sets forth the Commissioner’s policy  for establishing\\n118\\nthe onset date of disability  for disabilities of traumatic origin, explainin g that\\nit must be considered whether the evidence supports a findi ng of disability\\nbeginning on the date of the traumatic event.  If a claimant has both a\\ntraumatic impairment and another type of impairment, all impairments must\\nbe considered in combination to determine onset date.  \\nSSR 18-01p states that for impairments did not result from a traumatic event,\\nthe SSA uses three classifications:  (1) static impairments, whose severity  is\\nnot expected to chang e over an extended  period; (2) impairments expected to\\nimprove with time; and (3) exacerbating  and remitting  impairments, which\\ndiminish and intensify  over time.  The onset date must be supported by the\\nevidence and also “be consistent with the nature of the impairment(s).” \\nConsideration is to be given to the date that the claimant alleged disability\\nbegan.   \\nSSR 18-01p acknowledg es that the date disability  is found to have\\ncommenced “may  predate the claimant’s earliest recorded medical\\nexamination or the date of the claimant’s earliest medical records[ .]”  This is\\nconsistent  with the superseded Ruling , SSR 83-20, which also recog nized that\\nit may be possible to reasonably  infer from the medical evidence that the\\nonset occurred prior to the date of the first recorded medical examination, for\\nexample, when the claimant stopped working .  \\nIf any information of record suggests that additional relevant medical\\nevidence is available, SSR 18-01p notes that the Commissioner is required to\\n“assist with developing  the record and may request existing  evidence  directly\\nfrom a medical source or entity  that maintains the evidence.” \\n3.The lay eviden ce of onset is key evidence, supporting  the medical evidence,\\nwarranting  remand for consideration. \\nApplicable law:  Under SSR 18-01p, SSA “may  consider evidence from other\\nnon-medical sources such as the claimant’s family , friends, or former\\nemployers, if we cannot obtain additional medical evidence or it does not\\nexist (e.g., the evidence was never created or was destroy ed), and we cannot\\nreasonably  infer the date that the claimant first met the statutory  definit ion of\\ndisability  based on the medical evidence in the file.”\\nSSR 18-02p explains the determination of disability  onset date in blindness\\ncases.  The Ruling  notes that some claimants meet all requirements for\\nentitlement for SSI based on blindness and also based on another impairment. \\nThe Ruling  explains that as to these claimants the agency  will establis h two\\nonset dates: one “for the first date the claimant meets all the requiremen ts for\\nentitlement to benefits or eligibilit y for SSI payments based on blindness, and\\nthe other will be for the first date the claimant meets all the requirements\\nbased on the other impairment.”\\n119\\n4.The substantial evidence of record showed that the claimant’s disability  began\\non the date of the traumat ic event causing  the disabling  impairment(s), and the\\nALJ erred in finding  a later onset date.\\nApplicable law: SSR 18-2p explains that with disabilities of a traumatic\\norigin, it must be consider ed whether the evidence supports a finding  of\\ndisability  beginning  on the date of the traumatic event.  If a claimant has both\\na traumatic impairment and another type of impairment, all impairments must\\nbe considered in combination to determine the onset date.  \\nH.THE DURAT ION REQUIRE MENT\\n1.The ALJ erred by failing  to combine the claimant’s related severe\\nimpairments to meet the 12 months duration requirement and by failing  to\\ndetermine that their combined effects could be expected to continue to be\\nsevere for 12 months, as shown by  the substantial evidence of record.\\n2.The ALJ erred by failing  to find that both the claimant’s relevant medically\\ndeterminable impairment(s) (MDI ) and inability  to perform substantial gainful\\nactivity  (SGA) because of the MDI(s) lasted or were expected to last for a\\ncontinuous, uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, as shown by the\\nsubstantial evidence of record.\\nApplicable Law :  The impairment must last, or be expected to last for at least\\n12 months, or result in death. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1509, 416.909. Unrelated\\nsevere impairments cannot be combined to meet the duration requirement. 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1523(a), 416.923(a). However, if the impairments are related\\nand are severe, SSA must determine whether the combined effect  of the\\nimpairments can be expected to continue to be severe for 12 months. 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1523(b), 416.923(b). \\nSSR 23-1p28 provides that to satisfy  the duration requirement for disability ,\\nboth the claimant’s relevant medically  determinable impairment(s) (MDI ) and\\ninability  to perform substantial gainful activity  (SGA) because of the MDI (s)\\nmust have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous, uninterrupted period\\nof at least 12 months, unless expected to result in death within 12 months of\\nthe onset of disability .  SSR 23-1p addre sses what SSA will do if it finds that\\nthe claimant’s MDI (s) meets the duration requirement based on an\\nexpectation of continued severity , but the claima nt returns to SGA within 12\\nmonths. The Ruling explains how an actual return to work that is SGA is\\nevaluated and that whether the determination will be reopened and reversed\\ndepends, in part, on whether SSA has already  approved an award of benefits. \\n28SSR 23-1p rescinded and replaced SSR 82-52, regarding the duration of the impairment. SSR 23-1p was\\neffective November 7, 2023, and is applicable to new applications filed on or after the applicable date of the\\nSSR a nd to claims that are pending on and af ter the applicable date. \\n120\\n3.The ALJ’s error in finding  the duration requirement was not met, resulted in\\nfurther error  in not addressing  the claimant’s functional limitations from\\nsevere impairments in the RFC assessment, warranting  remand for such\\nconsideration.\\n.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 23-1p addresses how the duration requirement affects\\nsteps 1 throug h 3 of the five-step disability  evaluation process for initial\\nclaims under Title II, age 18 redeter minations, and adult claims under Title\\nXVI. Because of the duration requireme nt, SSA will not include limitations in\\nthe RFC assessment for impairments that do not meet the duration\\nrequirement. The Ruling  explains that the duration requirement also applie s at\\neach of the 3 steps of the three-step sequential evaluation process for child’s\\nSSI claims. SSR 23- 1p provides that for child’s SSI cases, duration is the\\nperiod of time during  which the claimant is not performing  SGA and\\nexperiences marked and severe functional limitations because of MDI (s).\\nSuccessive, unrelated MDI s which individually  do not meet the duration\\nrequirement will not be combined to meet the 12 month requirement. \\n4.The ALJ erred in establishing  a new period of disability  using the rules for\\ninitial claims, because the substantial evidence shows claimant’s new\\ndisabling  MDI  began in, or before, the month in which the previously\\nestablished MDI  is no long er disabling .\\nApplicable law: SSR 23-1p addresses continuing  disability  review (CDR)\\nclaims and explains that if the new disabling  MDI(s) begins in, or before, the\\nmonth in which the previously  established MDI (s) is no longer disabling , SSA\\ndoes not consider duration and will find that disability  continues. However, if\\nthe new disabl ing MDI (s) begins after the month in which the last\\nimpairment(s) was no longer disabling , SSA considers the duratio n\\nrequirement and determines whether to establish a new period of disability\\nusing  the rules for initial claims.\\n \\n5. The ALJ did not develop a complete medical history  of at least 12 months\\nprior to deny ing the disability  claim, requiring  remand for develop ment of the\\nrecord.\\nApplicable law: The Social Securit y Act, 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(B ), requires\\nSSA to develop a complete medical history  of at least the preceding  12\\nmonths prior to deny ing a claim. The regulations provide that prior to making\\na determination that a claimant is not disabled, SSA will develop the\\nclaimant’s complete medical history for at least the 12 months preceding  the\\nmonth in which the application is filed “unless there is a reason to believe that\\ndevelopment of an earlier period is necessary  or unless you say that your\\ndisability  bega n less than 12 months before you filed your application.” 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1512(b)(1), 416.912( b)(1). Further, SSA “will make every\\nreasonable effort to help [the claimant]  get medical evidence from your own\\nmedical sources . . . when you give us permission to request the reports.” Id.\\nThe reg ulations define what constitutes every  reasonable effort. Id. \\n121\\nI. VOCATIONAL EXPERT TESTIMONY\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 83-14 and/or SSR 85-15 by not citing\\nexamples of specific occupations that the claimant can perform and the\\nincidence of such work in the national economy .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 83-14, entitled “Title II and XVI: The Medical-\\nVocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating  a Combina tion of Exertional\\nand Nonexertional I mpairments” states that:\\nWhenever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disable d, the determination or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/jobs the person  can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several regions of the\\ncountry .\\nSimilarly , SSR 85-15, entitl ed “Title II and XVI: Capability  to Do Other\\nWork– the Medic al-Vocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating  Solely\\nNonex ertional Impairments” also states that whenever vocational resources\\nare used and the decision is adverse to the claimant, the decision will include: \\n“(1) citatio ns of examples of occupations/jobs the person can do functionally\\nand vocationally, and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .”\\n2.The ALJ relied on vocational expert testimony  which listed solely  semi-\\nskilled jobs but did not identify  the claimant’s  acquired work skills and the\\nspecific jobs to which they  transfer, as required by  SSR 82-41.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  82-41 specifically  provides that the\\nALJ set forth finding s of facts regarding  the issue of the transferability  of\\nskills.  SSR 82-41 states: \\nFindings of fact in determinations or decisions involving transferabili ty\\nof skills. When the issue of skills and their transferability  must be\\ndecided, the adjudicator or ALJ is required to make certain finding s of\\nfact and include them in the written decision.  Findin gs should be\\nsupported with appropriate documentation.\\nWhen a finding  is made that a claima nt has transferable skills, the\\nacquired work skills must be identified, and specific occupations to which\\nthe acquired work skills are transferable must be cited in the State\\nagency’s determination or ALJ’s decision .  Evidence  that these specific\\nskilled or semiskilled jobs exist in significant numbers in the national\\neconomy  should be included (the regulations take administrative notice\\nonly of the existence of unskilled sedent ary, light, and medium jobs in\\nthe national economy ).\\n122\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 00-4p by not asking  the VE if his/her\\ntestimony  was consistent with the DOT.\\nApplicable law:  Most decisions contain the statement: “Pursuant to SSR 00-\\n4p, the vocational expert’s testimony  is consistent with the informati on\\ncontained in the Dictionary  of Occupa tional Titles.”  However, in some cases\\nthe transcript does not document that the ALJ asked the VE whether his or her\\ntestimony  was consistent with the DOT, as required by SSR 00-4p.  Social\\nSecurity  Ruling 00-4p unambig uously  sets out the ALJ’s affirmative duty to\\nboth “ask about any possible conflict between that [vocational expert or\\nvocational specialist]  evidence and information provided in the DOT” and if\\nthe vocational evide nce appears to conflict with the DOT, to obtain a\\nreasonable explanation for the apparent conflict before relying on the VE’s\\ntestimony .  This stems from the ALJ’s duty to “fully  develop the record” and\\nrequires the ALJ to inquire, on the record, as to whether or not the VE’s\\ntestimony  is consistent with the DOT.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ violated SSR 00-4p by not resolving  the conflict between the VE’s\\ntestimony  and the DOT.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  00-4p clarifies the standards for the\\nuse of vocational experts, and discusses the circumstances when the\\noccupational evidence provided by a VE is not consistent with the DOT.  The\\nRuling  states that when there is an apparent unresolved  conflict between the\\ntestimony  of the VE and the DOT, the ALJ is required to elicit a reasonable\\nexplanation for the conflict before relying on the VE’s testimony .  As part of\\nthe ALJ’s duty to “fully  develop the record,” the ALJ is required to inquire,\\non the record, as to whether or not the VE’s testimony  is consiste nt with the\\nDOT.  The Ruling  speci fically states that neither the DOT nor the vocational\\nexpert testimony  “automatically  ‘trumps’ when there is a conflict.”  Id.\\nSSR 00-4p also contains documentation requirements, stating :\\nWhen vocational evidence provided by a VE . . . is not consistent with\\ninform ation in the DOT, the [ALJ] must resolve this conflict before\\nrelying on the VE . . . evidence to support a determination or decision\\nthat the individual is or is not disabled.  The [ALJ] will explain in the\\ndetermination or decision how he or she resolved the conflict.  The ALJ\\nmust explain the resolution of the conflict irrespective of how the conflict\\nwas identified.\\nAdditionally , HAL LEX I -2-6-74(E) instructs:\\nBefore the ALJ may rely on a VE’s testimony to support a disability\\ndecision, the ALJ must inquire on the record whether there are any\\n123\\nconflicts between occupational evidence the VE provided and\\ninformation contained in the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT),\\nincluding  its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of\\nOccupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary  of Occupationa l Titles\\n(SCO), published by the U. S. Department of Labor.  The ALJ must\\nidentify  and obtain a reasonable explanation for any such conflict. The\\nALJ also must explain in the decision how he or she resolved any\\nidentified conflict.  See SSR 00-4p.\\n5.The VE’s testimony  that the claimant, who require s a sit/stand option, could\\nperform lig ht jobs as a [ state jobs]  is not consistent with the DOT.\\nApplicable  law:  The DOT specifies that “standing ” is defined as “being  on\\none’s feet in an uprig ht position without moving  abo  t.” DOT, Appendix\\nC(IV)(a).  Thus, according  to the DOT, jobs defined as “light work” entail\\nstanding  for up to six hours a day in “an upright position without moving\\nabout” and would not allow for a sit/stand option.\\n6.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant is limited to “simple, repetitive\\ntasks,” the VE’s testimony  that the claimant can perform jobs as an office\\nclerk (DOT #209.562-010) [or cashier (DOT #211.462-0 14) or sales attendant\\n(DOT #299.677-010) or surveillance system monitor (DOT #379.367-010),\\netc.] conflicts with the DOT because, according  to the DOT, an individual\\nwho “is limited to simple, unskilled tasks” could not perform any of these\\nfour jobs.\\nApplicable law:  According  to the DOT, work as an office clerk, cashier,\\nsales attendant, and surveillance system monitor all entail a reasoning  at a\\nlevel of “3.”  These functions are part of the General Educational\\nDevelopment (“GED”) of the job, which “embraces those aspects of\\neducation (formal and informal) which are required of the worker for\\nsatisfactory  job performance.”  According  to the DOT, reasoni ng level “1”\\njobs can be performed by an individual who can understand and carry  out\\n“simple” instructions; level “2” jobs can be performed by an individual who\\ncan understand and carry out “detailed but uninvolved written or oral\\ninstructio ns;” and level “3” jobs entail even greater abilities.29  Id.  Thus, jobs\\n29 The reasoning scales range from a low of “1” to a high of “6,”  which are defined as follows: \\nLEVEL 6 - Apply  principles of logical or scientific thinking to a wide range of intellectual and practical\\nproblems. Deal with nonverbal symbolism (formulas, scientific equations, graphs, musical notes, etc.) in its\\nmost difficult phases. Deal with a variety of abstract and concrete variables.

Interpret a variety of instructions\\n124\\nat a reasoning  level of “3,” like those of the office clerk, cashier, sales\\nattendant, and surveillance system monitor entail even more complex  abilities\\nthan perform ing detailed instructions, and certainly  could not be performed by\\nthe claimant, who is limited to simple, unskilled tasks.\\nSocial Security  Ruling  00-4p provides:\\nOccupational evidence provided by a [vocational expert or vocational\\nspecialist]  generally should be consistent with the occupational\\ninformation supplied by the DOT.  When there is an apparent unresolved\\nconflict between VE or VS evidence and the DOT, the adjudicator must\\nelicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict before relying on the VE\\nor VS evidence to support a determination or decision about whether the\\nclaimant is disabled.  At the hearings level, as part of the adjudicator’s\\nduty to fully develop the record, the adjudicator will inquire, on the\\nrecord, as to whether or not there is such consistency .\\nNeither the DOT nor the VE or VS evidence automat ically “trumps”\\nwhen there is a conflict.

MEDICAL  EXPERT TESTIMONY \\n         \\n1.Given the ambig uity in the medical evidence , the ALJ was required to obtain\\nME testimony .  \\n2.Given the evidence suggesting  that the claimant’s impairment(s) medically\\nequal a listing , the AL J was required to obtain ME testimony .\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5- 34(A)(1) provides that the ALJ must obtain\\nan ME opinion, either in testimony  at a hearing  or in responses to written\\ninterrog atories in the following  circumstances:  (1) The Appeals Council or\\nFederal court ordered an ME opinion; (2) There is a question about the\\naccuracy  of medical test results reported, requiring  evaluation  of backg round\\nmedical test data; (3) The ALJ is considering  finding  that the claimant’s\\nimpairment(s) medically  equals a listing . Id.  The regulations provide that\\nALJs “may  also ask for medical eviden ce from expert medical sources” and to\\nconsider such evidence under 20 C.F.R. §§  404.1520b, 404.1520c, 404.1527,\\n416.920b, 416.920c, 416.927.; see also  20 C.F.R. §§  404.1513a(b)(2),\\n416.913a(b)(2).\\n3.The ALJ committed legal error by not notify ing the claimant in advance of the\\nhearing  that a ME was testify ing at the hearing .\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-6-70(A)(Note 1) states that when an ME is\\nscheduled to testify  at a hearing , the hearing  office “staff must notify  the\\n126\\nclaimant of this appearance in the ‘REMARKS ’ section of the Notice of\\nHearing ” and must also specify  the “manner in which the ME will appear.”\\n4.The ALJ committed legal error by not notify ing the claimant that a ME was to\\ntestify  by telephone as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.938(b), 416.1438(b) and\\nthe claimant was prejudiced as the ALJ relied on the ME testimon y and the\\nME never had the opportunity  to hear the claimant’s testimony .\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  regulations provide that the claimant will\\n“be told if [the]  appearance . . . of any other party or witness is scheduled to\\nbe made by video teleconferencing  rather than in person.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.938(b), 416.1438(b).

A determination  that there has\\nbeen a decrease in medical severity must be based on chang es\\n(improvement) in the symptoms, signs and/or laboratory  finding s\\nassociated with y our impairment(s).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(1), 416.994(b)(1)(i). To apply the medical\\nimprovement standard, the ALJ must first compare the medical severity  of the\\ncurrent impairment(s) to the severity  of the impairme nt(s) which was present\\nat the time of the most recent favorable medical decision finding  the claimant\\ndisabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(7), 416.994(b)(1)(vii).  In order to\\ndetermine whether disability  continues or ends, the ALJ must determine if\\nthere has been any medical improvement in a claimant’s impairment(s) and, if\\n129\\nso, whether this medical improvement is related to the claimant’s ability to\\nwork.  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1594(a), 416.994(b).\\nThe regulations provide that medical improvement is not related to the\\nclaimant ’s ability to work if there has been a decrease in the severity  of the\\nimpairment(s), but no increas e in the claimant’s functional capacity  to do\\nbasic work activities. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(2), 416.994(b)(1)(ii).  If there\\nhas been any medical improvement in a claimant’s impairment(s), but it is not\\nrelated to the claimant’s ability  to do work and none of the exceptions applies,\\nthe claimant’s benefits will be continued.  Id.\\nThe regulations include the following  example that can be cited to\\ndemonstrate that the claimant’s condition has not, in fact, improved:\\nExample 1: You were awarded disability  benefits due to a herniated\\nnucleus pulposus.  At the time of our prior decision granting  you benefits\\nyou had had a laminectomy .  Postoperatively , a myelogram still shows\\nevidence of a persistent deficit in your lumbar spine.  You had pain in\\nyour back, and pain and a burning  sensati on in your right foot and leg. \\nThere were no muscle weakness or neurolog ical chang es and a modest\\ndecrease in motion in your back and leg.  When we reviewed your claim\\nyour treating  physician reported that he had seen you regularly every  2 to\\n3 months for the past 2 years. No further myelograms had been done,\\ncomplaints of pain in the back and right leg continued especially  on\\nsitting  or standing  for more than a short period of time.  Your doctor\\nfurther reported a moderately  decreased range of motion in your back and\\nright leg, but again no muscle atrophy  or neurolog ical chang es were\\nreported.  Medic al improvement has not occurred because there has been\\nno decrease in the severity  of your back impairment as shown by chang es\\nin sy mptoms, sig ns or laboratory  finding s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1594(b)(1), 416.994(b)(1)(i).\\n2.As the ALJ failed to exhibit [or cite] to the records from the comparison point\\ndecision, the basis for the medical improvement finding  is unclear, warranting\\nremand  for further consideration.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations require that in a termination case, the ALJ\\nmust  have the prior case file “with the supporting  medical evidence\\npreviously  used to establish or continue your entitlement.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1593(a), 416.993(a).  The reg ulations further provide that:\\nthe medical evidence we will need for a continuing  disability  review will\\nbe that required to make a current determination or decision as to wheth er\\nyou are still disabled, as defined under the medi cal improvement review\\nstandard. See §§ 404.1579 and 404.1594.\\n130\\nId.; see also HAL LEX 1-2-1-13 (B)(1) (stating  that the hearing  staff “will\\nrequest a prior claim(s) file, without needing  to consult with the ALJ” when\\nthe  “pending  claim is before the ALJ based on a continuing  disability\\nreview”) ( citing  20 C.F .R.  §§ 404.1593 and 416.993).\\n3.The ALJ did not follo w the eight-step medical improvement standard\\napplicable in cessation cases as mandated under the reg ulations.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations require the ALJ to follow an eight-step\\nsequential evaluation process in determining  whether a claimant’s medical\\ncondition has improved such that his/her disability has ceased.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1594(f), 416.994(b)(5).  The steps are as follows:\\nStep one:  The ALJ must first determine whether the claimant is engaged\\nin substantial g ainful activity .\\nStep two:  If the claimant is not engaged in “substantial gainful activity ,”\\nthe ALJ must determine whether the claimant suffers from  an impairment\\nwhich meets or equals the severity  of an impairment listed in Appendix  1\\nof the reg ulations.\\nStep three :  If there is no impairment which meets or equals a listing , the\\nALJ must determi ne whether there has been medical improvement. If\\nthere is no decrease in the medical severity , there is no medical\\nimprovement.\\nStep four :  If there has been medical improvement, the ALJ must\\ndetermin e whether such improvement is related to the ability  to work, or\\nwhether there has been an increase in the claimant’ s residual functional\\ncapacity  based on the impairment that was present at the time of the most\\nrecent favorable medical determination.\\nStep five:  If there has been no medical improvement found at step 3 or if\\nat step 4, the medical improveme nt was not related to the ability  to work,\\nthe ALJ must determin e whether any exceptions to the medical\\nimprovement standard exist.  If no exceptions apply , the ALJ will find\\nthat the disability  continues.  If the first group of exceptions applies,\\ncontin ue to step 6.  If an exception from the second group of exceptions\\napplies, the AL J will find that the disability  ended.\\nStep six:  If there has been medica l improvement related to the\\nclaimant’s ability  to work or if one of the first group of exceptions to\\nmedic al improvement applies, the ALJ must determine whether the\\nclaimant currently  has a severe impairment or combination of\\nimpairments.  I f not, the claimant is no long er disabled.\\nStep seven :  If the impairment is severe, the ALJ assesses the claimant’s\\n131\\nRFC based on the claimant’s current impairments, and whether the\\nclaimant can still do the work s/he has performed in the past.  If the\\nclaimant is still capable of doing  such work, the ALJ will find that the\\nclaimant is no long er disabled.\\nStep eight:  If the claimant cannot do the kind of work that s/he\\nperformed in the past, the ALJ must review the claimant’s RFC and\\nhis/her age, education, and work experience to determine whether the\\nclaimant is capable of performing any other work which exists in the\\nnational economy .  If the claima nt can, the ALJ will find that the\\ndisability  ended.  I f not, the disability  continues.\\n4.The ALJ erred by not considering  whether the claimant, whose disability  had\\nalleg edly ceased, was disabled at any time throug h the date of the ALJ’s\\ndecision as required under SSR 13-3p.\\nApplicable law :  Throug h SSR 13-3p, the SSA adopted the holding  in Difford\\nv. Sec’y of Health and Human Servs. , 910 F.2d 1316 (6th Cir. 1990) as its\\nnationwide policy regarding administrative review of cessation\\ndeterminations, interpreting  the Social Security  Act’s references to “now” and\\n“current” to require consideration of whether the claimant was disabled at any\\ntime throug h the date of the adjud icator’s final determination or decision,\\nincluding  the date of the Appeal s Council’s action where it grants review and\\nissues a decision.  The Ruling  also provides that a timely  request to review a\\ncessation decision constitutes a protective filing  and eliminates the need for a\\nnew application with reg ard to the period throug h the final decision.  Id.\\nIn all cases other than those wherein the claimant is found disabled during  the\\nentire period under consideration, “the adjudicator must fully  explain the basis\\nfor the conclusion reached in the determination or decision.”  Id.  This\\nincludes specify ing the month the disability  ended, and, if applicable, the\\nmonth in which a new period of disability  began. Id.  The decision must\\nspecifically  address the initial cessation determination and the claimant’s\\neligibility  or inelig ibility  for a new a period of disability .  Id.\\nK.CHILDREN’S SSI CL AIMS30\\n1.The ALJ erred in not finding  that the child’s [state areas of functioning ] was\\nnot markedly  limited because the medical evidence showed [descri be the\\nevidence] .\\n30 More detailed information about the 2009 Rulings pertaining to children’s SSI claims as well as a chart\\noutlining the various domains and the norms expected for different age groups is contained in the author’s\\npubl ication, Sarah Bohr’ s Pocket Guide to Key Social Security Rulings - 16th Edition. An order form for this\\npubl ication as well as other publ ications is at the back of this book.\\n132\\n2.The ALJ erred in determining  the child claimant’s impairments did not meet\\nor medically  equal Listing *** [state applicable listing ] because [describe the\\nmedical evidence that supports the listing ].\\nApplicable law :  The Social Security  Act provides: \\nAn individual under the age of 18 shall be considered disabled for the\\npurposes of this title if that individual has a medically  determinable\\nphysical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe\\nfunctional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or\\nwhich has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not\\nless than 12 months.\\n42 U.S.C. § 1382c(a) (3)(C)(1).  The regulations provide that a child is\\n“disabled” if the child is not engaged in substantial gainful activity  and has a\\nmedically  determinable physical or mental impairment or com bination of\\nimpairments that results in “marked and severe functional limitations.”  20\\nC.F.R. 416.906.  The “impairment(s) must meet, medically  equal, or\\nfunctionally  equal the  listings” 20 C.F.R. § 416.924(d).  “An impairment\\ncauses marked and severe functional limitations if it meets or medically\\nequals the severity  of a set of criteria for an impairment in the listing s or if it\\nfunctionally  equals a listing .”  Id.  See also 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (defining\\n“functional equivalence”). \\nThe regulations set forth a three-step sequential evaluation process to\\ndetermine whether a child is disabled.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.924 (a)-(d).  First,\\nif a child is engaged in substantial gainful activity , s/he is not disabled.\\nSecond, the child’s impairments must be “severe.”  Finally , the child’s\\nimpairment s must either meet, medically  equal, or functionally  equal in\\nseverity  a listed impairment contained in the L isting  of Impairments.  Id.  \\nAn impai rment is functionally  equal to a listed impairment when it results in\\n“marked” limitations in two domains of functioni ng or an “extreme”\\nlimitation in one domain.  20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(b).  The adjudicator must\\nassess the functional limitations caused by the impairment, that is what the\\nchild cannot do, has difficulty  doing , needs help doing , or is restricted from\\ndoing  because of the impairm ent. In making  this assessment, the “interactive\\nand cumulative effects of all of the impairments” for which there is evidence,\\nincluding  any impairments that are not “severe” are considered.  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.926a(a).  \\nThe reg ulations set forth the following  six domains of function which apply  to\\nall ag e groups: \\n(1)acquiring  and using  information;31\\n31 This domain includes the ability to think, to acquire and use information, visual and verbal reasoning,\\nproblem solving, and idea development. It also includes perceptual, sensorimotor, language and memory\\n133\\n(2)attending  and completing  tasks; 32\\n(3)interacting  and relating  with others;33 \\n(4)moving  about and manipulating  objects;34\\n(5)caring  for y ourself;35 and  \\n(6)health and phy sical well-being .36\\n20 C.F .R. § 416.926a(b)(1).37\\nprocesses necessary to learn.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (g), SSR 09- 3p.\\n32 This domain considers the child’s level of alertness, ability to work at an appro priate pace, allay impulses,\\nand initiate, sustain and change focus. It also includes the capacity to focus on certain stimuli and ignore\\nothers.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (h), SSR 09- 4p.\\n33 This domain assesses all aspects of social interaction and relationships with groups and individuals. This\\nincorporates speech and language skills necessary to communicate effectively. It also includes the ability to\\nrespond to emotional and behavioral cues and form intimate relationships and externalized maladaptive\\nbehaviors.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (i), SSR 09- 5p.\\n34 This domain looks at the child’s ability to perform physical functions like sitting, standing, balancing,\\nshifting weight, bending, crawling, runni ng, and transferring. It also includes the ability to hold, carry, and\\nmanipulate objects, as well as the capacity to plan, remember and execute movements. Also considered are\\nthe child’s coordination, dexterity, and integration of sensory input .  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (j), SSR 09-6p.\\n35 This domain measures the child’s ability to care for his or her physical needs and to maintain a healthy\\nemotional state. It includes the ability to care for one’s own health and safety and to cooperate with others\\nto meet one’s needs. It also incorporates the concept that the child should be developing an increasing sense\\nof independence and co mpetence.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (k), SSR 09- 7p.\\n36 This domain looks at the cumulative physical effects of physical and/or mental impairments. It includes\\nthe effects of chronic illness, including shortness of breath, reduced stamina, pain, and poor growth as well\\nas the impact of therapies, medications, and exa cerbations.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (l), SSR 09- 8p.\\n37 In assessing a child’s functioning in these domains, the adjudicator must request and consider information\\non the following ques tions:\\n  \\n• Wha t activities is the child is able to perform? \\n• Which of the child’s activities are restricted or limited compared to other children the same\\nage who do not have impairments?\\n• Whe re does the child have difficulty with activities - at home, in childcare, at school, or in\\nthe community?\\n• Does the child hav e difficulty independently initiating, sustaining or completing activities?\\n• Wha t kind of help does the child need to do his or her activities, how much help, and how\\noften is it needed?\\n20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (b)(2).\\n134\\nThe regulations define a “marked” limitation as “seriously  interfering ” with\\nthe child’s ability  to inde pendently  initiate, sustain or complete activities.  20\\nC.F.R. § 416.926a(e)(2). A standardized test score between two and three\\nstandard deviations below the norm for the test is one way to meet this\\nstandard. Id. The definition of “extreme ” is “interferes very  seriously ” with\\nthe ability  to function.  20 C.F.R. § 416.926 a(e)(3). A test score at or below\\nthree standard deviations below the norm for the test is one way to meet this\\nstand ard. Id. In addition, the regulations state that SSA will not consider any\\npiece of evidence  in isolation, including  test scores.  20 C.F.R. §\\n416. 926a(e)(4). Instead, the totality  of the evidence must be considered in\\ndetermining  whether the child has marked or ex treme limitations. Id.\\n3.The ALJ erred in the evaluation of the child claimant’s [marked or extreme]\\nlimitations in cognition and speech, and did not apply  SSR 98-1p in\\ncons idering whether the impairments were medically  equal to Listing  2.09,\\neven if not meeting  or equaling  Listing  112.05.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 98-1p describes when a child’s impairment will be\\ndeemed medically  equivalent to L isting  2.09.  \\nA child whose impairment does not meet the capsule definition in Listing\\n112.05 may still be disabled by having  limitations that are medically\\nequivalent to Listing  2.09.  The child may still have a “marked” limitation in\\ncognitive functioning , along  with an impairment that causes a “marked ”\\nspeech limitation, and this combination of limitations “will be found\\nmedically  equivalent to L isting  2.09 in part A of the listing s.”\\nAs explained in SSR 98-1p states that evidence of the severity  of cognitive\\nlimitation “should” include: \\n(1)the results of psycholog ical testing  (which “must” be sufficiently\\ncurrent), with subtest scores, and the psycholog ist’s interpretation of\\nthe results, including  a conclusion reg arding  validity ; and \\n(2)information about learning  achievement and descriptions from medical\\nand lay  sources of the child’s ability  to perform ag e-appropriate,\\ncognitively  related tasks and activities at home and school.\\nEvidence of speech limitation severity  should also include both medical and\\nlay information: \\n(1)comprehensive examinatio n results concerning  the child’s speech\\n(articulation, voice, fluency ); and \\n(2)descriptions of the child’s speech in daily  circumstances from lay  and\\nprofessional sources who have opportunities to listen to the child. \\nA “marked” cognitive limitation can be shown with or without standardized\\n135\\ntest scores.  SSR 98-1p states that, usually , a “marked” cognitive limitation is\\nidentified when standardized intelligence tests yield a valid score two\\nstandard deviations below the norm. In the absence of valid standardized\\nscores, such a limitation is usually  present when  the impairment(s) of a child\\nunder age 3 results in cognitive functioning  at a level that is more than one-\\nhalf but not more than two-thirds of the child’s chronolog ical age; or when the\\nimpairment(s) of a child 3 to 18 interfere(s) seriously  with cognitive\\nfunctioning  (“more than moderate” but “less than extreme” interference).  The\\nrating  given “must be based on all of the relevant evidence in the case\\nrecord.”\\nSSR 98-1p observes that if the evidence available does not use the descriptors\\nemploy ed in the table, or if it is unclear “how the terms are used, it may be\\nnecessary  to contact the source to clarify  the information.”  The Ruling\\nacknowledg es:\\nTerms such as “poor,” “severe,” “mild,” or “marked” may be used in the\\nevidence to describ e a child’s functioning . These terms have different\\nmeaning  to different people. Therefore, when such terms are not\\nillustrated or explained by the evidence, it may be necessary  to contact the\\nsource for an ex planation of their meaning .\\nSSR 98-1p notes that, in order to assure recency  of the evidence, “it may be\\nnecessary  to obtain a consultative ex amination[ .]”\\n4.The ALJ erred in not considering  the “whole child” in evaluating  whether the\\nchild claimant’s impairment(s) were functionally  equivalent to a listed\\nimpairment as required under SSR 09-1p: Determining  Childhood Disability\\nUnder the F unctional Equivalence Rule — The “W hole Child” Approach.\\n5.The ALJ did not “provide sufficient detail” in evaluating  the “whole child” as\\nrequired by  SSR 09-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-1p provides that functional equivalence is measured\\nby considering  the child’ s functioning  as a “whole” first, not by considering\\nthe domain s or individual impairments. “When we evaluate your functioning\\nand decide which domains may be affected by your impairment(s), we will\\nlook first at your activities and limitations and restrictions.” 20 C.F.R.\\n416.926a(c).\\nSSR 09-1p further directs the adjudicator to consider first all of the child’s\\nactual functioning  in all activities and settings while considering  all domains\\nthat are involved in doing  those activities. The following  questions are to be\\nasked:\\n1.How does the child function?\\n2.Which domains are involved in performing  the activities?\\n136\\n3.Could the child’s medically  determinable  impairment(s) account for\\nlimitations in the child’s activities?\\n4.To what degree does the impairment(s) limit the child’s ability  to function\\nage-appropriately  in each domain?  \\nThe adjudicator is directed to rate limitations in a domain based on the\\nanswers to the following  questions:\\n1.How many  of the child’s activities in the domain are limited (for example,\\none, few, several, many , or all)?\\n2.How important are the limited activities to the child’s age-appropriate\\nfunctioning  (for ex ample, basis, marg inally  important, or essential)?\\n3.Where do the limitations occur (for example, only  at home or in all\\nsetting s)?\\n4.What factors are involved in the limited activities (for example, does the\\nchild receive support from a person, medication, treatment, deice, or\\nstructured/supportive setting )?\\nSSR 09-1p. The Ruling  further states, “we do not require our adjudicators to\\ndiscuss all of the considerations in [SSR 09-1p]  in their determinations and\\ndecisions, only  to provide sufficient detail so that any subsequent reviewers\\ncan understand how they  made their finding s.”\\n6.The ALJ committed reversible error in assuming  that because the child\\nsuffered from a combination of impairments, the resulting  limitations must be\\nspread among  several domains when, in fact, they resulted in an “extreme”\\nlimitation in one domain.\\n7.The ALJ erred by only  considering the child’s impairment in a single domain\\nwhen the child’s limitations were demonstrated to have been applicable to\\nmore than one domain.\\nApplicable law :  As set forth in SSR 09-1p:\\nA single impairment, as well as a combination of impairments, may result\\nin limitations that require evaluation in more than one domain. \\nConve rsely, a combination of impairments, as well as a single impairment,\\nmay result in limitations that we rate in only  one domain.\\nThis Ruling  further states that rating  the limitations caused by a child’s\\nimpairment(s) in each and every  domain that is affected is not “double\\nweig hting ” of either the impairment(s) or its effects.  Rather, it recog nizes the\\nparticular effects of the child’s impairment(s) in all domains involved in the\\nchild’s limited activities.\\n137\\n8.In rating  the severity  of the child’s limitations, the ALJ did not take into\\nconsideration the extensiv e help that the child requires to get him/her throug h\\nhis/her school day and be as independent as s/he appears next to his/her peers,\\nas required by  SSR 09-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-1p directs consideration of the type of help or\\nsupp ort a child needs in order to function.  See also 20 C.F.R. 416.924a.  The\\nRuling  explains:\\n[i]f a child needs a person, medica tion, treatment, device, or structured,\\nsupportive setting  to make his functioning  possible or to improve the\\nfunctioning , the child will not be as independent as same-age peers who\\ndo not have impairments. Such a child will have a limitation, even if he is\\nfunctioning  well with the help or support.\\nThe more help or support of any kind that a child receives beyond what\\nwould be expected f or children the same age without impairments, the less\\nindependent the child is in functioning , and the more severe we will find\\nthe limitation to be.\\nSSR 09-1p.\\n9.The ALJ erred in not examining  the child’s limitations “long itudinally ,” as\\nrequired by SSR 09-1p and 20 C.F.R. 416.924a(b)(8) which require SSA to\\nconsider functioning  over time.\\nApplicabl e law:  In evaluating  the severity  of the child’s limitations, the\\neffects of the impairment(s) should be considered “long itudinally  (that is over\\ntime).”  SSR 09-1p.  F or ex ample,\\nIf you have a chronic impairment(s) that is characteriz ed by episodes of\\nexacerbation (worse ning) and remission (improvement), we will consider\\nthe frequency  and severi ty of your episodes of exacerbation as factors that\\nmay be limiting  your functioning .  Your level of functi oning may vary\\nconsiderably  over time.  Proper evaluation of your ability  to function in\\nany domain requires us to take into account any variations in your level of\\nfunctioning  to determine the impac t of your chronic illness on your ability\\nto function over time.\\n20 C.F .R. 416.924a(b)(8).\\n10.The ALJ committed reversible error in according  “little, if any,” weig ht to the\\nopinion of the child claimant’s [treating  nurse practitioner or treating\\nchiropractor or mental health therapist]  as such opinions must be conside red\\nin determining  how the claimant’ s impairment affects functioning , in\\naccordance with SSR 09-2p.\\n138\\n11.The ALJ did not properly  consider to the opinion of the child’s physical\\ntherapist regarding  the child’s physical development, muscle streng th and\\nresulting  severity  of limitation in being  able to engage in age- appro priate\\nphysical activities.\\n12.The opinions of the workers at the child’s care center were improperly\\ndismissed by the adjudicator in violation of SSR 09-2p as they offer a clear\\npicture of how the child functions in his/her day-to-day  environment and\\nshould have been accepted to show the severity  of the child’s impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-2p provides that evidence from “other medical\\nsources,”  such as nurse-practitioners, physicians’ assistants, naturopaths,\\nchiropractors, audiolog ists, occupational therapists, physical therapi sts, and\\npsychiatric social workers, may not be used to establish that a child has a\\nmedi cally determinable impairment. However, such evidence may be used “to\\ndetermine the severity  of the impairment(s) and how it affects the child’s\\nability to function compared to children of the same age who do not have\\nimpairments.”\\nAlso, evidence from non-medical sources, such as “parents and careg ivers,\\neducational personnel (for example, teachers, early  intervention team\\nmembers, counselors, developmental center workers, and daycare center\\nworkers), public and private social welfare agency  personnel, and others (for\\nexample, sibling s, friends, neighbors, and clerg y),” will be considered “to\\ndetermine the severity  of the child’s impai rment(s) and how the child\\ntypically  functions compared to children of the same age who do not have\\nimpairments.”  SSR 09-2p.\\n13.The ALJ committed reversib le error in evaluating  whether the child\\nclaimant’s impairment is medically  equivalent to a listed impairment.\\nApplicable Law :  Medical equivalence in children’s SSI claims is determined\\nby comparing  the symptoms, signs, and laboratory  findings about an\\nimpairment, including , where appropriate, any functional limitation s resulting\\nfrom the impairment, with the corresponding  criteria shown for any listing . \\n20 C.F.R. § 416.926(a).  Equivalence in children can be found in cases where\\nthe child has an impairm ent described in the listing , but either (a) one or more\\nof the medical finding s specified in the particular listing  is not specifi ed or (b)\\none or more of the findings is not as severe as that specified in the listing .  20\\nC.F.R. § 416.926(a)(1)(i). Medical equivalence can be found when the\\nmedical finding s relating  to the impairment are at least of equal medical\\nsignificance and (1) a child does not exhibit one or more of the medical\\nfinding s specified in the particular listing , or (2) the child exhibits all of the\\nmedical finding s, but one or more of the findings is not as severe as specified\\nin the listing .  20 C.F.R. § 416.926(a)(1)(i).  Additionally , where a child has\\nan impairment that is not described in the listing, or a combination of\\nimpairments not one of which meets or is medically  equivalent to a listing , the\\nclosest analog ous listed impairment will be used. If the medical finding s are\\n139\\nof “equal medical significan ce” to those in a listed impairment, medical\\nequivalence to the closest listing  will be found.  Id.\\n14.The ALJ committed reversible error in failing  to develop the record by\\nobtainin g any of [child claimant’s]  school records and/or reports from his/her\\nteachers.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in determining  whether a child\\nis disabled, information from nonmedic al sources, such as “parents, teachers,\\nand other people” must be considered.  20 C.F.R. § 416.924a(a).  The\\nregulations specifically  address the importance of school records:\\n(iii) School.  If you go to school, we will ask for information from your\\nteachers and other school personnel about how you are functioning  there\\non a day-to-day  basis compared to other children your age who do not\\nhave impairmen ts.  We will ask for any reports that the school may have\\nthat show the results of formal testing  or that describe any special\\neducation instruction or services, including  home-based instruction, or any\\naccommodations provided in a reg ular classroom.\\n20 C.F.R. § 416.924a(a)(2)(iii).  The regulations further provide that if the\\nchild attends school, including  preschool, “we will ask your teacher(s ) about\\nyour performance in your activities throughout your school day” and will\\nconsider evidence from your school, “including  teacher questionnaires ,\\nteacher checklists, group achievement testing , and report cards.”  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.924a(b)(7)(ii).  SSR 09-2p states:\\nWe require adjudicators to try to get school records wheneve r they are\\nneeded to make a determination or decision regarding  a child’s disability . \\nWe do not require information from school personnel in every case\\nbecause sometimes we can decide that a child is disabled without it, such\\nas when the child’s impairment(s) meets the requirements of a listing .  We\\nmay also have to make a determination or decision without all or school\\nevidence when we are unable to obtain it.\\n15.The ALJ erred when s/he did not find that the child claimant’s diabetes\\nmellitus, which required daily  insulin, meets the requirements of Listing\\n109.08.38\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p states that children with DM who require daily\\ninsulin and are under age 6 are to be found disabled under  Listing 109.08. \\nThis is because such children are presumed not to have “developed the\\ncognitive ability  for recog nizing and responding  to hypoglycemia symptoms;\\nthat is, they have hypoglycemia unawareness .”  Due to this lack of awaren ess\\n38 Additional arguments pertaining to SSR 14-2p as it relates to children are addressed unde r “Spe cific\\nImpairments,” Section III, Section D, addressing “Endo crine Disorders (Other than Diabetes Mellitus), infra,\\nat pages 150- 54.\\n140\\nand the life-thr eatening  conditions that can result, these children need near-\\nconstant visual contact from parents or caregivers.  Therefore, they have\\nimpairments that meet listing  109.08.”  After attainment of age 6, however, no\\nsuch presumption exists because ordinarily  “children develop the cognitive\\nability  for recog nizing and responding  to their hypoglycemia symptoms by\\nage 6.”\\nM.YOUNG  ADUL TS’ CL AIMS\\n1.The ALJ erred by not adhering  to the rules for the evaluation of the young\\nadult claimant’s case pursuant to SSR 11-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 11-2p addresses the adjudication of disability  claims\\nwhere the claimant is a young  adult— an individu al between 18 and\\napprox imately  25 years of age.  Whereas the same definition of disability  is\\nused for young  adults and other adults, the Ruling  notes that the evidence SSA\\nconsiders when it makes “disability  determinations for young  adults is\\ngenerally  the same as, or similar to, the evidence [it] consider[ s] for making\\ndisabili ty determinations for older adolescents under title XVI.”  Id.  The\\nRuling  recog nizes that often, young  adults have the same types of\\nimpairments as children, such as attention deficit/hy peractivity  disorder.  The\\nRuling  confirm s SSA will consider all medically  determinable impairments\\n“the y oung  adult has, including  [those]  that are usually  found in children.”  Id.\\nAcknowledg ing that work “requires a person to be able to do the tasks of a job\\nindependently , appropriately , effectively , and on a sustained basis[ ,]”  SSR\\n11-2p also states “the analy sis for adult disability  determin ation purposes is\\nsimilar to our ‘extra help’ rules for children.” Id.; see 20 C.F.R. §\\n416.924a(b)(5)(ii).  So long as the young  adult would need “greater\\nsupervision or assistance, or some other type of accommodation, because of”\\nan impairment “than an employ ee who does not have an impairment, the adult\\nhas a work-related limitation.” Id.  The more support needed, the more severe\\nthe limitation.  Id.\\n2.The ALJ did not properly  consider the evidence from the young  adult\\nclaimant’s former teachers or community  experiences as required by SSR 11-\\n2p.\\n3.The ALJ erred by ignoring the extra help and accommodations the young\\nadult claimant requires, as set forth in SSR 11-2p.\\nApplicable law:  Concerni ng sources of information bearing  on a young\\nadult’s ability to work, SSR 11-2p acknowledg es that evidence from medical\\nsources other than “acceptable medical sources” can prove valuable for\\ndetermining  the severity  of an impairment established throug h an acceptab le\\nmedical source.  The Ruling  discusses in detail various cons iderations for\\nevaluating impairment-related functional limitations, including  1) evidence\\n141\\nfrom  educational prog rams; 2) community  experiences; 3) psychosocial\\nsupports and special setting s; 4) extra help and accommodations; and 5) work-\\nrelated stress.\\nN. GENETIC TESTING\\n1.The ALJ abrog ated his/her legal responsibility  to consider genetic test\\nevidence supportive of disability  as described in SSR 16-4p.\\nAppli cable Law:  SSR 16-4p addresses genetic test evidence and explains\\nthat such evidence can be part of the objecti ve medical evidence used to\\nestablish an impairment.  Specifically , so long  as the results come from an\\nacceptable medical source and are not derived from direct to consumer tests,\\ngenetic testing  can be used to establis h the existence of a medically\\ndeterminable impairment.\\nThe Ruling  also notes that in addition to aiding  diagnosis of particular\\ndiseases or disord ers, genetic tests “assist in predicting  the extent of disease\\nfeatures or risk of developing  a certain disorder [and]  aid in therapy [.]” Id. \\nThere are now tens of thousands of genetic tests available, allowing for the\\nidentification of thousands of genetic disorders.  With the “exception of non-\\nmosaic Down syndrome, genetic test results alone are not sufficient to make a\\ndisability  determination or decision.”  Id.  In other cases, althoug h the SSA\\nwill not specifi cally order genetic testing  as part of a consultative\\nexamination, genetic test results may supply  part of the evidence of disability .\\nConformation of genetic abnormalities can help in assessing  the consistency\\nor supportability  of alleg ed sy mptoms and limitations.\\n2.The ALJ mistakenly  disreg arded genetic test evidence supportive of the\\nmedically  determinable impairment of *** as required under SSR 16-4p.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 16-4p addresses genetic test evidence and explains\\nthat such evidence can be part of the objective medical  evidence used to\\nestablis h an impairment.  Specifically , so long  as the results come from an\\nacceptable medical source and are not derived  from direct-to consumer tests,\\ngenetic testing  can be used to establish the existence of a medically\\ndeterminable impairment.\\nIII. SPECIFIC IM PAIRM ENT ISSUE S39\\nA. DRUG  ADDICT ION AND AL COHOLISM (DAA) (SSR 13-2p)\\n1.The ALJ committed reversible error in findi ng that alcoholism is a\\n“contributi ng factor material” to an otherwise favorable disability\\ndetermination.\\n39 This section focuses on the discussion of specific impairmen ts in the Rulings and does not addre ss the\\nspecific Listings of Impairments (Adult  and Chi ldren).\\n142\\nApplicable law:  The Senior Citiz en’s Right to Work Act of 1996 (“Rig ht to\\nWork Act”), Pub. L. No. 104-1 21, 110 Stat. 847-57 (1996) (amending  § 42\\nU.S.C. §§ 423(d)(2) & 1382(c) eliminated alcoholism as a basis for obtaining\\nSocial Security  disability  insurance and SSI benefits.  Section 105(a)(1)(c) of\\nthe Act provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]n individual shall not be\\nconsidered to be disabled for purposes of this title if alcoholism or drug\\naddiction would (but for this subp aragraph) be a contributing  factor to the\\nALJ’s determination that the individual is disabled.”\\nFollowing  the enactm ent of the Right to Work Act, the Office of Disability  of\\nthe Social Security  Administration issued a telety pe entitled “Questions and\\nAnswers Concerning  DAA from July 2, 1996 Teleconference – Medical\\nAdjudicators--ACTI ON,” dated August 30, 1996 (the “Emerg ency Telety pe”). \\nThe Emerg ency Telety pe states that if mental impairments cannot be\\nseparated from alcohol or drug addiction, a finding  of “not material” is\\nappropriate when making the materiality  determination.  Id.  This rationale\\nextended to SSR 13-2p, in Question 7, “If the evidence in the case record does\\nnot demonstrate the separate effects of the treatment for DAA and for the co-\\noccurring  mental disorder(s), we will find that DAA is not material . . . .”  \\nThe Social Securi ty regulations provide that the key factor to examine in\\nmaking this determination is whether SSA would still find a claimant disabled\\nif the claimant stopped using  drugs or alcohol.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1535,\\n416.935.  SSA is required to evaluate which of the claimant’s current physical\\nand mental limitations, upon which it based the curre nt disability\\ndetermination, would remain if the claimant stopped using  drugs or alcohol. \\nSSA will then determine whether any or all of the claimant’s remaining\\nlimitations would be disabling . Only  if the remaining  limitations would not be\\ndisabling , will SSA find that drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing\\nfactor material to the determination of disability .  Id.\\nSSR 13-2p emphasiz es that DAA  is not material where the claimant would\\nstill be disabled in the absence of drug or alcohol use.  Where a history  of\\nDAA exists that is not relevant to the period under consideration, there  is not\\neven a need for a materiality  determination.  Id.  Similarly , where the claimant\\nhas a disabling  impairment(s) unrelated to, and not exacerbated by DAA, or\\nthat is irreversible, DAA is not material and no further development of DAA\\nevidence is appropriate.  Id.\\nPursuant to SSR 13-2p, the best evidence  for determining  the effect of\\nabstaini ng is ordinarily  evidence from a relevant period of abstinence. Indeed,\\nthe Ruling  cautions:\\nAdjudicators should generally  not rely on a medical opinion to find that\\nDAA is material if the case record contains credible evidence from an\\nacceptable medical source from a relevant period of abstinence indica ting\\nthat the impairment(s) would still be disabling  in the absence of DAA.  In\\ncases in which it is appropriate to rely on a medic al opinion to find that\\n143\\nDAA is material despite evidence indicating  the impairment(s) may not\\nimprove, adjudi cators must provide an appropriate rationale to resolve the\\napparent conflict in the evidence.\\nId.  Further, DAA is not to be deemed material where the fully  developed\\nrecord fails to establish that abstinence would improve the claimant’s physical\\nimpairment(s) to the point of nondisability .  Id.\\n2.The ALJ committed legal error in not first determining  whether the claimant\\nis disabled before finding  that alcoholism is a “contributing  factor material” to\\nan otherwise favorable disability  determination.\\nApplicable law:  In determining  whether alcoholism is a “contributing  factor\\nmaterial” to an otherwise favorable disability  determination, the ALJ is\\nrequired to first determine whether the claimant is disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1535, 416.935.  This is done by using  the five-step sequential evalua tion\\nprocess, without segregating out any effects that might be due to substance\\nuse disorders, and the determination must be based on the claimant’s medical\\nlimitations without deductions for the assumed effects of substance use\\ndisorders.  Only  after determining  what limitations would remain in the\\nabsence of alcoholism or drug  addiction, may the ALJ then reach a conclusion\\non whether the claimant’s substance abuse is a contributing  material factor to\\nthe disability  determination.  Id.\\n3.The ALJ erred by determining  that the claimant has [a drug addiction]\\n[alcoholism] .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p observes that drug  addiction and alcoholism\\n(DAA) is diagnosed in part by the presence of maladaptive use of alcohol,\\nilleg al drug s, prescription medications, or toxic substance s.  DAA thus does\\nnot include (1) fetal alcohol syndrome; (2) fetal cocaine exposure; or (3)\\naddiction  to, or use of, prescription medications taken as prescribed.  Id.  The\\nRuling  clarifies that occasional maladaptive use, or a history  of occasional\\nprior maladaptive use does not establish a medically  determinabl e Substance\\nUse Disorder.  Id.  A claimant has DAA only where s/he has a medically\\ndeterminable Substance Use Disorder, which is decided using  the same rules\\nas for any  other medically  determinable impairment.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ reversibly  erred by assuming  the claimant’s mental disorder would\\nimprove in the absence of drug  or alcohol use.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p differentiates between physical impairments and\\nmental impairments for the purpose of assessing  materiality .  Certain physical\\nimpai rments are recog nized as likely  to improve with abstinence, such as\\nalcoholic hepatitis,  fatty liver, and alcoholic cardiomy opathy . Id. Where the\\nclaimant has another impairment(s) that is mental in natur e, the situation is\\ndifferent. SSR 13-2p concedes “[w]e do not know of any research data that we\\ncan use to predict reliably  that any given claimant’s co-occurring  mental\\n144\\ndisorder would improve, or the extent to which it would improve, if the\\nclaimant were to stop using drugs or alcohol.”  Id.  Therefore, “[u]nlike cases\\ninvolving  physical impairments, we do not permit adjudicators to rely\\nexclusively  on medical expertise and the nature of a claimant’s mental\\ndisorder.”  Id.  To support a finding  that DAA is material in cases involving\\nmental impairment(s), there must be other evidence in the case record\\nestablishing  the claimant would not be disabled in the absence of DAA.  Id.\\n5.The ALJ erred by assuming  improvement of a mental disorder during  a period\\nof abstinence from [ drug s] [alcohol]  indicates materiality .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p cautions that improvement of a co-occurring\\nmental disorder that occurs “in a highly structured treatment setting, such as a\\nhospital or substance abuse rehabilitation center, may be due at least in part to\\ntreatment for the co-occurring  mental disorder, not (or not entirely ) the\\ncessation of substance use.”  The Ruling  states:\\nA co-occurring  mental disorder may appear to improve because of the\\nstructur e and support provided in a highly structured treatment setting .  As\\nfor any mental disorder,  we may find that a claimant’s co-occurring\\nmental disorder(s) is still disabling  even if increased support or a highly\\nstructured setting  reduce the overt sy mptoms and sig ns of the disorder.\\nId.  Unless the evidence demonstrates “the separate effects of the treatment\\nfor DAA and for the co-occurring  mental disorder(s), we will find that DAA\\nis not material[ .]”  The Ruling  concludes:\\nGiven the foreg oing principles, a single hospital ization or other inpatient\\nintervention is not sufficient to establish that DAA is material when there\\nis evidence that a claima nt has a disabling  co- occurring  mental\\ndisorder(s).  We need evidence from outside of such highly structured\\ntreatment setting s demonstrating  that the claimant’s co-occurring  menta l\\ndisorder(s) has improved, or would  improve, with abstinence. In addition,\\na record of multiple hospitaliz ations, emergency  department visits, or\\nother treatmen t for the co-occurring  mental disorder — with or without\\ntreatment for DAA — is an indication that DAA may not be material even\\nif the claimant is discharg ed in improved condition after each intervention.\\n6.The ALJ did not recog nize the importance of evidence from “other” sources\\nin assessing  the severity  and materiality  of the claimant’s drug addiction or\\nalcoholism.\\nAppl icable law:  SSR 13-2p acknowledg es that many  claimants receive care\\nfrom sources that are not acceptable medical sources, and that evidence from\\nthese sources can be helpful in determining  the severity  of DAA and whether\\nDAA is material to the finding  of disabilit y.  This information can describe a\\nclaimant’s function ing over time and be especially  helpful in documenting  the\\nseverity  of DAA and can assist in the determination of materiality  by\\n145\\ndocumenting how well the claimant performs daily  living  activities in the\\npresence of a comorbid impairment.  Id.  The Ruling  recog nizes that “[i]n\\nmany cases, evidence from ‘other’ sources may be the most impor tant\\ninformation in the case record for these documentation issues.”  Id.\\n7.The ALJ did not ident ify substantial evidence to support the finding s made as\\nto the claimant’s [ drug  addiction]  [alcoholism]  as required by  SSR 13-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p requires adjudica tors to provide sufficient\\ninformation that a subsequent reviewer considering  the evidence of record can\\nunderstand the reasons for: (1) the finding  that the claimant has DAA; (2) the\\nfinding  that the claimant is disabled at step 3 or step 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process considering  all of his or her impairments, including  DAA;\\nand (3) the finding  that the claimant would still be disabled at step 3 or 5 of\\nthe sequential evaluation process in the absence of DAA, or the finding  that\\nthe claimant would not be disabled at step 2, 4, or 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process in the absence of DAA. This information must be provided\\nby the ALJ, or by the Appeals Council (when the Appeals Council makes a\\ndecision), in the decision rationale.  Id.\\nB.CHRONIC FAT IGUE SYNDRO ME (CFS) (SSR 14-1p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 14-1p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s chronic fatig ue sy ndrome.\\n2.The Appeals Council should remand this case with instructions to evaluate the\\nclaimant’s CF S in accordance with SSR 14-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-1p restates and clarifies the ALJ’s policies for\\nevaluating  disability  based on CFS.  CFS is defined as a “systemic disord er\\nconsisting  of a complex  of symptoms that may vary in incidence, duration,\\nand severity” which is characteriz ed in part by “prolong ed fatigue lasting  6\\nmonths or more, resulting  in a substantial reduction in previous levels of\\noccupational, educational, social, or personal activities.”  It is diagnosed “only\\nafter alternative medical and psychiatric causes of chronic fatig uing  illness\\nhave been ex cluded.”  Id.\\nThe Ruling  explains that CFS, when accompanied by appropriate medical\\nsigns or laboratory  finding s, is a medical ly determinable impairment that can\\nbe the basis for a finding  of “disability .”  In evaluating  a claim of CFS, the\\nexistence of one or more of the following  medical signs, clinically\\ndocumented over a period of at least 6 consecutive months, help establish a\\nmedically  determinable impairment:\\n•Palpably  swollen or tender lymph nodes on physical examination;\\nNonex udative phary ngitis;\\n146\\n•Persistent, reproducible muscle tenderness on repea ted examinations,\\nincluding  the presence of positive tender points; or\\n•Any other medical signs that are consistent with medically  accepted\\nclinical practice and are consistent with the other evidence in the case\\nrecord. For example, an acute infectious inflammatory  event preceding\\nonset of CFS, or signs such as frequent viral infections with prolong ed\\nrecovery , sinusitis, ataxia, extreme pallor, and pronounced weig ht\\nchang e.\\nSSR 14-1p  further provides that an individual with CFS can also exhibit a\\nwide rang e of other manifestations, including :\\nmuscle weakness, sleep disturbances, visual difficu lties (trouble focusing\\nor severe photosensitivity ), orthostatic intolerance (e.g., lightheadedness,\\nfainting , dizziness, or increased  fatigue with prolong ed standing ),\\nrespiratory  difficulties, cardiovascular abnormalities, gastrointestinal\\ndiscomfort, and urinary  or bladder problems.\\nSSR 14-1p contains examples of laboratory  finding s that establish the\\nexistence of a medically  determinable  impairment of CFS, recog nizing that\\n“there are no specific laboratory  finding s that are widely accepted as being\\nassociated with CFS.”  Id.  Thus, “the absence of a definitive test does not\\npreclude . . . reliance upon certain laboratory  finding s to establish the\\nexistence of a [ medically  determinable impairment]  in people with CF S.”  Id.\\nThis Ruling  also acknowledg es that “[s]ome with CFS report ongoing\\nproblems with short-term memory , information processing , visual-spatial\\ndifficulties, comprehension, concentra tion, speech, word-finding , calculation,\",\n",

Did the ALJ fail to adequately assess the cumulative impact of the claimant's impairments on their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-8p and SSR 85-15?\\n\\n4. Is there substantial evidence to support the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform other work in the national economy, given the limitations outlined in the record?\\n\\n5. Did the ALJ err by failing to consider the vocational expert's testimony regarding job availability that accommodates the claimant's specific limitations?\\n\\n6. Was the ALJ's reliance on the Grids to determine the claimant's disability status inappropriate given the unique circumstances of the case?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ adequately explain the rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and limitations, as required by SSR 16-3p?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the medical opinions provided by the claimant's treating physician, in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1527 and 416.927?\\n\\n9. Is the ALJ's decision to deny benefits inconsistent with the medical evidence presented, which supports the claimant's allegations of disability?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ fail to consider the impact of the claimant's mental health conditions on their ability to perform work-related activities, as outlined in SSR 85-15?\\n\\n11. Is the ALJ's finding that the claimant can perform light work supported by the evidence, given the claimant's documented physical limitations?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ adequately address the claimant's need for breaks and how this impacts their ability to perform work, as required by SSR 96-9p?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ's decision lack clarity regarding the specific jobs the claimant can perform, as required by SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14?\\n\\n14. Is the ALJ's conclusion that the claimant can perform other work undermined by the lack of vocational expert testimony addressing the claimant's specific limitations?\\n\\n15. Should the Appeals Council remand the case for further consideration of the claimant's limitations and their impact on the ability to perform work, given the substantial evidence supporting the claim of disability?\\n\\n16. Did the ALJ err in finding the claimant not disabled based on the ability to perform jobs listed in the DOT that SSA has determined to be \\\"isolated\\\" occupations?\\n\\n17. Did the ALJ fail to consider the claimant's educational background, including any special education received, in determining the claimant's education category?\\n\\n18. Did the ALJ err in applying a Grid rule that applies to individuals with a high school education or more, given the evidence that the claimant has a remote education?\\n\\n19. Did the ALJ commit reversible error by mechanically applying the age criteria of the Grids in borderline situations regarding the claimant's age?\\n\\n20. Did the ALJ err in not considering the claimant's illiteracy and its implications for the disability determination in accordance with Vocational Rules 201.17 and/or 202.09?\\n\\nThis refined set of questions incorporates the relevant legal context and rulings while ensuring clarity and specificity in addressing potential errors made by the ALJ.. Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: Social Security  Ruling  03-2p, addressing  reflex sympathetic dystrophy ,\\ndiscusses the side effects of medications taken to treat chronic pain:\\nChronic pain and many  of the medic ations prescribed to treat it may\\naffect an individual’s ability  to maintain attention and concentration, as\\nwell as adversely  affect his or her cognition, mood, and behavior, and\\nmay even reduce motor reaction times.  These factors can interfere with\\nan individual’s ability  to sustain work activity  over time, or preclude\\nsustained work activity  altog ether.  When evaluating  duration and\\nseverity , as well as when evaluating  RFC, the effects of chronic pain and\\nthe use of pain medications must be carefully  considered.\\n9.While the ALJ summariz ed the claimant’s testimony , s/he erred in not\\nproviding  specific ration ale for rejecting  this testimony , as required by SSR\\n16-3p.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 16-3p states that:\\nIn evaluating  an individual’s symptoms, it is not sufficient for our\\nadjudicators to make a single, conclusory  statement that “the individual’s\\nstatements about his or her symptoms have been considered” or that “the\\nstate ments about the individual’s symptoms are (or are not) supported or\\nconsistent.”  It is also not enoug h for our adjudicators simply  to recite the\\nfactors described in the reg ulations for evaluating  symptoms.\\nRather, SSR 16-3p requires that the decision contain “contain specific reasons\\nfor the weight given to the individual’s symptoms, be consistent with and\\n110\\nsupported by the evidence, and be clearly  articulated so the individu al and any\\nsubsequent reviewer can assess how the adjudicator evaluated the individual’s\\nsymptoms.”\\n10.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the State Agency  Medical Consultants’\\nfinding s that the claimant was credible.\\nApplicable law:  The State Agency  Medical Consultant, specifically  opined\\nthat the claimant’s symptoms were “full y credible.”  Social Security  Ruling\\n16-3p requires an ALJ to consider finding s from State agency medical and\\npsycholog ical sources about the existence and severity  of an individual’s\\nimpairment(s), including  the existence and severity of any symptoms and\\nprovides as follows:\\nMedical evidence from medical sources that have not treated or examined\\nthe individual is also important in the adjudicator’s evaluation of an\\nindividual’s statements about pain or other symptom s.  For example,\\nState agency  medical and psycholog ical consultants and other prog ram\\nphysicians and psycholog ists may offer findings about the existence and\\nseverity  of an individual’s symptoms .  We will consider these findings in\\nevaluating  the intensity , persistence, and limiting  effects of the\\nindividual’s symptoms.  Adjudicators at the hearing  level or at the\\nAppe als Council level must consider the finding s from these medical\\nsources even thoug h they  are not bound by  them.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n11.The ALJ did not consider the claimant’s persistent efforts to obtain pain relief\\nfor his/her sy mptoms as addressed in SSR 16-3p.\\nApplicab le law:  Social Security  Ruling  16-3p recog nizes that a claimant’s\\npersistent efforts to obtain relief from his/her pain or other symptoms may\\nsupport the intensity  and persistence of sy mptoms:\\nPersistent attempts to obtain relief of symptoms, such as increasing\\ndosag es and chan ging medications, trying a variety  of treatments,\\nreferrals to specialists, or chang ing treatment sources may be an\\nindication that an individual’s symptoms are a source of distr ess and may\\nshow that they  are intense and persistent.\\n12.The ALJ did not comply  with the regulations in not addressing  various\\nwitness statements in the record describing  the claimant’s limitations.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide for consideration of “all of the\\nevidence presented, including  inform ation about your prior work record, your\\nstatements about your symptoms, evidence submitted by your medical\\nsources, and observations by our employ ees and other persons.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n111\\n404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3).\\n13.The ALJ did not comply  with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529, 416.929 in evaluating\\nthe claimant’s subjective symptoms as s/he did not consider the “observations\\nby our employ ees,” as required.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1529(c)(3), 416.929(c)(3)  states that “[w]e\\nwill consider all of the evidence presented, including  information about your\\nprior work record, your statements about your symptoms, evidence submitted\\nby your medical sources, and observations by our employ ees and other\\npersons.”\\nE.EFFECT OF OPINIO NS O F OTHER AG ENCIES REGARDING\\nDISAB ILITY\\n1.The ALJ committed legal error in not consi dering and addressing  the\\nunderly ing and supporting  evidence which supported the [VA’s or workers\\ncompensation or State disability  agency ] finding  of disability .\\nApplicable law:  Determinations by other governmental and non-\\ngovernmental agencies, such as the Departm ent of Veterans Affairs, the\\nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel\\nManag ement, State agencies, and private insurers including workers\\ncompensation providers are not binding  on SSA.  As set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1504, 416.904: “[b]ecause a decision by any other governmental agency\\nor a non-g overnmental entity about whether you are disabled, blind ,\\nemploy able, or entitled to any benefits is based on its rules and is not binding\\non us and is not our decision about whether you are disabled or blind under\\nour rules.”  Thus, SSA will not “provide any analy sis” of such a\\ndetermination.  Id.  Howeve r, SSA “will consider all of the supporting\\nevidence underly ing the other governmental agency  or nong overnmental\\nentity ’s decision that we receive evidence in your claim in accordance with §\\n404.1513(a)(1) throug h (4).”  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1504, 416.904.\\n2.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant’s receipt of unemploy ment benefits\\nautomatically  bars his/her application for Social Security  benefits.\\nApplicable law:  While an ALJ may consider the receipt of unemploy ment\\nbenefits and the surrounding  circumstances, an application for disability  may\\nnot be denied solely  on the ground that the applicant received unemploy ment\\nbenefits.  SSR 00-1c, which was based on the Supreme Court ’s decision in\\nCleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795 (1999), held there was no\\ninherent conflict between claims for disability  insurance benefits and claims\\nunder the American with Disabilities Act.  \\nIn a memorandum from Frank Cristaudo, Chief Administrative Law Judge,\\n112\\ndated August 9, 2010,26 he expressed SSA’s policy  regarding SSR 00-1c’s\\napplication to unemploy ment benefits:\\nThis is a reminder of the polic y concerning receipt of unemploy ment\\ninsurance benefits.  Receipt of unemploy ment benefits does not preclude\\nthe receipt of Social Security  benefits. The receipt of unemploy ment\\nbenefits is only one of many  factors that must be considered in\\ndetermining  whether the claimant is disabled.  See 20 C.F.R. 404.1512(b)\\nand 416.912(b).\\nIn considering  claims of individuals who have applied for unempl oyment\\nbenefits, Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) should be mindful of the\\nprinciples discussed in Social Security  Ruling 00-1c, which incorporates\\nCleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp. , 526 U.S. 795 (1999).  In that\\ncase, the Supreme Court held, in a unanimous decision, that a claim for Social\\nSecurity disability  benefits is often consistent with a claim for relief under the\\nAmerican with Disabilities Act (ADA) even thoug h there must be an inability\\nto work in order to obtain relief under the ADA. . . .\\nIn addition, it is often uncertain whet her we will find a person who applies for\\nunemploy ment benefits ultimately  to be disabled under our rules, and our\\ndecision maki ng process can be quite lengthy.  Therefore, it is SSA’s position\\nthat individuals need not choose between apply ing for unemploy ment\\ninsurance and Social Security  benefits.\\nThe Memorandum goes on to state that an “application for unemploy ment\\nbenefits is evidence that the ALJ must consider together with all of the\\nmedical and other evidence” and that “ALJs should look at the totality  of\\ncircumstances in determining the significance of the application for\\nunemploy ment benefits and related efforts to obtain employ ment.”\\nPursuant to 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(b), 416.912(b) a claimant must prove\\ndisability  by evidence that includes, for ex ample,\\n(3) [s]tatements you or others make about your impairment(s), your\\nrestrictions, your daily  activities, your efforts to work, or any other\\nrelevant statements . . .; or\\n(4) [i]nformation from other sources, as described in §404.1513(d).\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(b)(3) &  (4), 416.912(3) &  (4) (emphasis added).\\nHowever, before  making  such an argument, it is recommended that you verify\\nthat the State at issue does not prohibit the application for or receipt of both\\nSocial Security  benefits and unemploy ment benefits.  It is also recommended\\nthat you verify  the information provided by the claimant in the applicati on for\\nunemploy ment benefits, or the requirements to receive unemploy ment\\n26 A copy of this Memorandum  is in Part II, Document #5, infra. \\n113\\nbenefits.  See also SSR 13-1p, which notes that alleg ations of ALJ bias\\nagainst claimants who receive unemploy ment bene fits, among  other\\nexamples, will be referred by the Appeals Council to the Division of Quality\\nService.\\nF. FAIL URE TO FOLLOW PRESCRIB ED TREATMENT  \\n1.The ALJ erred in evaluating  the claimant’s subjective complaints by focusing\\non his/her failure to obtain treatment without first making  a good cause\\ndetermination about the claimant’s reasons for the lack of treatment or not\\nfollowing  prescribed treatment pursuant to SSR 16-3p and/or SSR 18-3p.\\n2.The ALJ erred in relying on the claimant’s failure to take prescri ption\\nmedication as a basis for rejecting his/her complaints of pain since the\\nclaimant established good cause pursuant to SSR  16-3p and/or 18-3p for not\\ntaking  such medications.\\n3.The ALJ erred in not apply ing SSR 16-3p that requires the ALJ to consider\\n“possibl e reasons he or she may not comply  with treatment or seek treatment\\nconsistent with the deg ree of his or her complaints.”\\n4.The AL J did not comply  with SSR 18-3p in finding  that the claimant was non-\\ncompliant with prescribed treatment.\\n5.The ALJ did not consider if the claimant “is unable to afford prescribed\\ntreatment, which he or she is willing  to follow, but for which affordable or\\nfree community  resources are unavailable,” as ex plained in SSR 18-3p.\\n6.The ALJ failed to consider if the claimant has a psychiatric impairment that\\nprovides good cause for the lack of treatment, as explained in HAL LEX II-5-\\n3-1.\\nApplicable law: SSR 16-3p provides that the ALJ must not draw any\\ninferences about a claimant’s symptoms and their functional effects from a\\nfailure to seek or follow proportional medical treatment without first\\nconsidering  any explanations that the claimant may provide, or other\\ninformation in the record, that may explain the infrequent or irreg ular medical\\nvisits or failure to comply  with recommended medical treatment.  SSR 16-3p\\nfurther provides that the ALJ may need to reconta ct the claimant or question\\nthe claimant at the hearing  to obtain such informat ion.  The Ruling  lists\\nvarious factors that may provide an explanation for the noncompliance or\\nlimited treatment.\\nSSR 16-3p sets forth specific examples of valid reason s for not obtaining\\ntreatment, including  the following :\\n•An individual may have structured his or her activities to minimiz e\\nsymptoms to a tolerable level  by avoiding  physical activities or mental\\n114\\nstressors that ag gravate his or her sy mptoms.\\n•An individual may receive period ic treatment or evaluation for refills\\nof medications because his or her sy mptoms have reached a plateau.\\n•An individual may not agree to take prescription medications because\\nthe side effects are less tolerable than the sy mptoms.\\n•An individual may not be able to afford treatment and may not have\\naccess to free or low-cost medical services.\\n•A medical source may have advised the individual that there is no\\nfurther effective treatment to prescribe or recommend that would\\nbenefit the individual.\\n•An individual’s symptoms may not be severe enoug h to prompt him or\\nher to seek treatment, or the sympto ms may be relieved with over the\\ncounter medications.\\n•An individual’s relig ious beliefs may  prohibit prescribed treatment.\\n•Due to various limitations (such as language or mental limitations), an\\nindividual may not understand the appropriate treatment for or the\\nneed for consistent treatment of his or her impairment.\\n•Due to a mental impairment (for example, individuals with mental\\nimpairments that affect judg ment, reality  testing , or orientation), an\\nindividual may not be aware that s/he has a disorder that requires\\ntreatment.\\n•A child may disreg ard the level and frequency  of treatment needed to\\nmaintain or improve functioning  because it interferes with his or her\\nparticipation in activities typical of other children his or her age\\nwithout impairments.\\nIn addition, a psychiatric impairment may provide good cause for not\\npursuing  treatment. HAL LEX II-5-3-1, Good Cause for Failure to Follow\\nPrescribe’ Treatment, provides that:\\nthe existence of a psychiatric impairme nt may provide good cause for a\\nclaimant’s failure to follow prescribed treatment. For example, we may\\nbe able to find good cause for failure to follow prescribed treatment in a\\ncase where the evidence shows that the claimant has paranoid\\nschiz ophrenia with symptoms including  a highly organized delusional\\nsystem that leads him or her to believe that people are attempting  to\\npoison him or her and that medication prescribed by a physician is part of\\nthe poisoning  ‘plot’ . . . . If a claimant has a psychiatric impairment and\\n115\\nhis or her refusal to follow prescribed treatment is based on that\\nimpairment or that impairment and a combination of other impairments,\\nthe Appeals Council may find that such impairme nt is good cause for not\\nfollowing  prescribed treatment.\\nSSR 16-3p further provides that the ALJ “will consider and address reasons\\nfor not pursui ng treatment that are pertinent to an individual’s case” and “will\\nexplain how” the reasons were considered in the “evaluation of the\\nindividual’s sy mptoms.”\\nThe regulations provide that “[i]n order to get benefits, you must follow\\ntreatment prescribed by your physician if this treatment can restore your\\nability  to work” and “[i]f you do not follow the prescribed treatment without a\\ngood reason, we will not find you disabled or, if you are already  receiving\\nbenefits, we will stop pay ing you benefits.” 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1530, 416.930.  \\nSSR 18-3p replaced SSR 82-59 to provide guidance on how SSA applies the\\nfailure to follow prescribed treatment policy  in disabili ty and blindness\\nclaims.  The policy  applies if three conditions are met: \\n(1) The person would otherwise be entitled to benefits or blindness benefits;\\n(2) There is evidence  that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed\\ntreatment for the medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the\\ndisability  finding  is based; and\\n(3) There is evidence that the individ ual did not follow the prescribed\\ntreatment.\\nIf all three condit ions exist, SSA then determines whether the individual\\nfailed to follow prescribed treatment based on either:\\n(1) Whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would be ex pected to\\nrestore the individual’s ability  to eng age in substantial g ainful activity\\n(SGA); or\\n(2) Whether the individual has good cause for not following the prescribed\\ntreatment. \\nIn adult claims, the individual has the burden to provide evidence showing\\nthat he or she has good cause for failing  to follow prescribed  treatment.  In\\nchild claims, the burden rests with the parent or guardian to show that the\\nchild has good cause.  Examples of acceptable good cause reasons, which\\nclaimants bear the burden of providing  evidence to show, include reasons\\nrelating  to religion, cost, incapacity , medical disag reement, psychiatric\\nimpairment which causes fear of treatment, intense fear of surgery, prior\\nhistory  of unsuccessful surgery, high risk of loss of life or limb, surgeries with\\nrisk of death, some cataract surgeries, amputation of an extremity , and\\naddiction to opioid medication and other reasons, determined on a case-by -\\n116\\ncase basis.27   \\n27 The  following are examples of acceptable good cause reasons for not following prescribed treatment:\\nReligion: The established teaching and tenets of the individual’s religion prohibit him or her from\\nfollowing the prescribed treatment. The individual must identify the religion, provide evidence of the\\nindividual’s membership in or affiliation to his or her religion, and provide evidence that the\\nreligion’s teachings do not permit the individual to follow the prescribed treatment.\\nCost: The individual is unable to afford prescribed treatment, which he or she is willing to follow,\\nbut for which affordable or free community resources are unav ailable. Some individuals can obtain\\nfree or subsidized health insurance plans or healthcare from a clinic or other provider. In these\\ninstances, the individual must demonstrate why he or she does not have health insurance that pays\\nfor the prescribed treatment or why he or she failed to obtain treatment at the free or subsidized\\nhealthcare provider.\\nIncapaci ty: The individual is unable to unde rstand the consequences of failing to follow prescribed\\ntreatment.\\nMedical disagreement: Whe n the individual’s own medical sources disagree about whether the\\nindividual should follow a prescribed treatment, the individual has good cause to not follow the\\nprescribed treatment. Similarly, when an individual chooses to follow one kind of treatment\\nprescribed by one medical source to the simultaneous exclusion of an alternate treatment prescribed\\nby another medical source, the individual has good cause not to follow the alternate treatment.\\nIntense fear of surgery: The individual’s fear of surgery is so intense that it is a contraindication\\nto having the surgery. We require a written statemen t from an individual’s own medical source\\naffirming that the individual’s intense fear of surgery is in fact a contraindication to having the\\nsurgery. We will not consider an individual’s refusal of surgery as good cause for failing to follow\\nprescribed treatment if it is based on the individual’s assertion that success is not guaranteed or that\\nthe individual knows of someone else for whom the treatment was not successful.\\nPrior history: The individual previously had major surgery for the same impairment with\\nunsuccessful results and the same or similar additional major surgery is now prescribed.\\nHigh risk of loss of life or limb: The treatmen t involves a high risk for loss of life or limb.\\nTreatments in this category include:\\nSurgeries with a ri sk of death, such as open-heart surgery or organ transplant.\\nCataract surgery in one eye with a documented, unus ually high-risk of serious surgical\\ncomplications when the individual also has a severe visual impairment of the other eye that cannot\\nbe improved through treatment.\\nAmputation o f an extremity or a major part of an extremity.\\nRisk of addi ction to opioid medication: The  prescribed treatment is for opioid medication.\\nOther: If the individual offers another reason for failing to follow prescribed treatment, we will\\ndetermine whether it is reasonably justified on a case-by- case basis.”\\nSSR 18- 3p.\\n117\\n7.The AL J erred in deny ing the claim based on the claimant’s failure to follow\\ntreatment as a listing  was satisfied in this case. \\nApplicable law:  With regard to step 3 of the sequential evaluation process,\\nSSR 18-3p explains that there  are two situations where no failure to follow\\nprescribed treatment determination will be made even if there is evidence that\\nan individual failed to follow prescribed treatment.  First, “when we find the\\nindividual disabled based on a listing  that requires only the presence of\\nlaboratory  finding s” and second, where  “the individual is disabled based on a\\nlisted impairment(s) which requires” consideration of “whether the individua l\\nwas following  that specific treatment as part of the required listing  analysis.” \\nThe Rulin g also discusses how child claims are handled in cases where there\\nis a potential failure to follow prescribed treatment, and explains that the same\\nexceptions just described apply  equally  to these claims. \\n8.The ALJ improperly  discredited the claimant based on lifest yle recommenda-\\ntions, such as dieting , exercise, or smoking  cessation. \\nSSR 18-3p defines prescribed treatment means any medication, surgery,\\ntherapy , use of durable medical equipmen t, or use of assistive devices. \\nPrescribed treatment does not include lifesty le modifications, such as dieting,\\nexercise, or smoking  cessation. \\n9.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 18-3p in relying on the opinion  of a\\ncons ultative physician as a basis for the finding  that the claimant did not\\nfollow prescribed treatment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 18-3p provides that the treatme nt must have been\\nprescrib ed by one of the claimant’s own medical sources.  Therefore, the\\nRuling  explains, the agency  will not find a failure “to follow prescribed\\ntreatment if the treatment was prescribed only by a consultative examiner\\n(CE), medical consultant (MC), psycholog ical consultant (PC),  medical expert\\n(ME), or by a medical source during  an evaluation conducted solely  to\\ndetermine elig ibility  to any  State or F ederal benefit.”  \\nG.ONSET DAT E\\n1.In light of the new evidence documenting  that SSA found the claimant\\ndisabled based on a subsequent application, the Appeals Council  should\\nremand this case with instructions to consider the onset date of his/her\\ndisability .\\n2.The ALJ committed reversible error in not providing  weig ht to a physician’s\\nretrospective opinion of the onset of the claimant’s condition.\\nApplicab le law:  Social Security  Ruling  18-01p, which along  with SSR 18-\\n02p replaced SSR 83-20, sets forth the Commissioner’s policy  for establishing\\n118\\nthe onset date of disability  for disabilities of traumatic origin, explainin g that\\nit must be considered whether the evidence supports a findi ng of disability\\nbeginning on the date of the traumatic event.  If a claimant has both a\\ntraumatic impairment and another type of impairment, all impairments must\\nbe considered in combination to determine onset date.  \\nSSR 18-01p states that for impairments did not result from a traumatic event,\\nthe SSA uses three classifications:  (1) static impairments, whose severity  is\\nnot expected to chang e over an extended  period; (2) impairments expected to\\nimprove with time; and (3) exacerbating  and remitting  impairments, which\\ndiminish and intensify  over time.  The onset date must be supported by the\\nevidence and also “be consistent with the nature of the impairment(s).” \\nConsideration is to be given to the date that the claimant alleged disability\\nbegan.   \\nSSR 18-01p acknowledg es that the date disability  is found to have\\ncommenced “may  predate the claimant’s earliest recorded medical\\nexamination or the date of the claimant’s earliest medical records[ .]”  This is\\nconsistent  with the superseded Ruling , SSR 83-20, which also recog nized that\\nit may be possible to reasonably  infer from the medical evidence that the\\nonset occurred prior to the date of the first recorded medical examination, for\\nexample, when the claimant stopped working .  \\nIf any information of record suggests that additional relevant medical\\nevidence is available, SSR 18-01p notes that the Commissioner is required to\\n“assist with developing  the record and may request existing  evidence  directly\\nfrom a medical source or entity  that maintains the evidence.” \\n3.The lay eviden ce of onset is key evidence, supporting  the medical evidence,\\nwarranting  remand for consideration. \\nApplicable law:  Under SSR 18-01p, SSA “may  consider evidence from other\\nnon-medical sources such as the claimant’s family , friends, or former\\nemployers, if we cannot obtain additional medical evidence or it does not\\nexist (e.g., the evidence was never created or was destroy ed), and we cannot\\nreasonably  infer the date that the claimant first met the statutory  definit ion of\\ndisability  based on the medical evidence in the file.”\\nSSR 18-02p explains the determination of disability  onset date in blindness\\ncases.  The Ruling  notes that some claimants meet all requirements for\\nentitlement for SSI based on blindness and also based on another impairment. \\nThe Ruling  explains that as to these claimants the agency  will establis h two\\nonset dates: one “for the first date the claimant meets all the requiremen ts for\\nentitlement to benefits or eligibilit y for SSI payments based on blindness, and\\nthe other will be for the first date the claimant meets all the requirements\\nbased on the other impairment.”\\n119\\n4.The substantial evidence of record showed that the claimant’s disability  began\\non the date of the traumat ic event causing  the disabling  impairment(s), and the\\nALJ erred in finding  a later onset date.\\nApplicable law: SSR 18-2p explains that with disabilities of a traumatic\\norigin, it must be consider ed whether the evidence supports a finding  of\\ndisability  beginning  on the date of the traumatic event.  If a claimant has both\\na traumatic impairment and another type of impairment, all impairments must\\nbe considered in combination to determine the onset date.  \\nH.THE DURAT ION REQUIRE MENT\\n1.The ALJ erred by failing  to combine the claimant’s related severe\\nimpairments to meet the 12 months duration requirement and by failing  to\\ndetermine that their combined effects could be expected to continue to be\\nsevere for 12 months, as shown by  the substantial evidence of record.\\n2.The ALJ erred by failing  to find that both the claimant’s relevant medically\\ndeterminable impairment(s) (MDI ) and inability  to perform substantial gainful\\nactivity  (SGA) because of the MDI(s) lasted or were expected to last for a\\ncontinuous, uninterrupted period of at least 12 months, as shown by the\\nsubstantial evidence of record.\\nApplicable Law :  The impairment must last, or be expected to last for at least\\n12 months, or result in death. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1509, 416.909. Unrelated\\nsevere impairments cannot be combined to meet the duration requirement. 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1523(a), 416.923(a). However, if the impairments are related\\nand are severe, SSA must determine whether the combined effect  of the\\nimpairments can be expected to continue to be severe for 12 months. 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1523(b), 416.923(b). \\nSSR 23-1p28 provides that to satisfy  the duration requirement for disability ,\\nboth the claimant’s relevant medically  determinable impairment(s) (MDI ) and\\ninability  to perform substantial gainful activity  (SGA) because of the MDI (s)\\nmust have lasted or be expected to last for a continuous, uninterrupted period\\nof at least 12 months, unless expected to result in death within 12 months of\\nthe onset of disability .  SSR 23-1p addre sses what SSA will do if it finds that\\nthe claimant’s MDI (s) meets the duration requirement based on an\\nexpectation of continued severity , but the claima nt returns to SGA within 12\\nmonths. The Ruling explains how an actual return to work that is SGA is\\nevaluated and that whether the determination will be reopened and reversed\\ndepends, in part, on whether SSA has already  approved an award of benefits. \\n28SSR 23-1p rescinded and replaced SSR 82-52, regarding the duration of the impairment. SSR 23-1p was\\neffective November 7, 2023, and is applicable to new applications filed on or after the applicable date of the\\nSSR a nd to claims that are pending on and af ter the applicable date. \\n120\\n3.The ALJ’s error in finding  the duration requirement was not met, resulted in\\nfurther error  in not addressing  the claimant’s functional limitations from\\nsevere impairments in the RFC assessment, warranting  remand for such\\nconsideration.\\n.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 23-1p addresses how the duration requirement affects\\nsteps 1 throug h 3 of the five-step disability  evaluation process for initial\\nclaims under Title II, age 18 redeter minations, and adult claims under Title\\nXVI. Because of the duration requireme nt, SSA will not include limitations in\\nthe RFC assessment for impairments that do not meet the duration\\nrequirement. The Ruling  explains that the duration requirement also applie s at\\neach of the 3 steps of the three-step sequential evaluation process for child’s\\nSSI claims. SSR 23- 1p provides that for child’s SSI cases, duration is the\\nperiod of time during  which the claimant is not performing  SGA and\\nexperiences marked and severe functional limitations because of MDI (s).\\nSuccessive, unrelated MDI s which individually  do not meet the duration\\nrequirement will not be combined to meet the 12 month requirement. \\n4.The ALJ erred in establishing  a new period of disability  using the rules for\\ninitial claims, because the substantial evidence shows claimant’s new\\ndisabling  MDI  began in, or before, the month in which the previously\\nestablished MDI  is no long er disabling .\\nApplicable law: SSR 23-1p addresses continuing  disability  review (CDR)\\nclaims and explains that if the new disabling  MDI(s) begins in, or before, the\\nmonth in which the previously  established MDI (s) is no longer disabling , SSA\\ndoes not consider duration and will find that disability  continues. However, if\\nthe new disabl ing MDI (s) begins after the month in which the last\\nimpairment(s) was no longer disabling , SSA considers the duratio n\\nrequirement and determines whether to establish a new period of disability\\nusing  the rules for initial claims.\\n \\n5. The ALJ did not develop a complete medical history  of at least 12 months\\nprior to deny ing the disability  claim, requiring  remand for develop ment of the\\nrecord.\\nApplicable law: The Social Securit y Act, 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(B ), requires\\nSSA to develop a complete medical history  of at least the preceding  12\\nmonths prior to deny ing a claim. The regulations provide that prior to making\\na determination that a claimant is not disabled, SSA will develop the\\nclaimant’s complete medical history for at least the 12 months preceding  the\\nmonth in which the application is filed “unless there is a reason to believe that\\ndevelopment of an earlier period is necessary  or unless you say that your\\ndisability  bega n less than 12 months before you filed your application.” 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1512(b)(1), 416.912( b)(1). Further, SSA “will make every\\nreasonable effort to help [the claimant]  get medical evidence from your own\\nmedical sources . . . when you give us permission to request the reports.” Id.\\nThe reg ulations define what constitutes every  reasonable effort. Id. \\n121\\nI. VOCATIONAL EXPERT TESTIMONY\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 83-14 and/or SSR 85-15 by not citing\\nexamples of specific occupations that the claimant can perform and the\\nincidence of such work in the national economy .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 83-14, entitled “Title II and XVI: The Medical-\\nVocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating  a Combina tion of Exertional\\nand Nonexertional I mpairments” states that:\\nWhenever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disable d, the determination or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/jobs the person  can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several regions of the\\ncountry .\\nSimilarly , SSR 85-15, entitl ed “Title II and XVI: Capability  to Do Other\\nWork– the Medic al-Vocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating  Solely\\nNonex ertional Impairments” also states that whenever vocational resources\\nare used and the decision is adverse to the claimant, the decision will include: \\n“(1) citatio ns of examples of occupations/jobs the person can do functionally\\nand vocationally, and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .”\\n2.The ALJ relied on vocational expert testimony  which listed solely  semi-\\nskilled jobs but did not identify  the claimant’s  acquired work skills and the\\nspecific jobs to which they  transfer, as required by  SSR 82-41.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  82-41 specifically  provides that the\\nALJ set forth finding s of facts regarding  the issue of the transferability  of\\nskills.  SSR 82-41 states: \\nFindings of fact in determinations or decisions involving transferabili ty\\nof skills. When the issue of skills and their transferability  must be\\ndecided, the adjudicator or ALJ is required to make certain finding s of\\nfact and include them in the written decision.  Findin gs should be\\nsupported with appropriate documentation.\\nWhen a finding  is made that a claima nt has transferable skills, the\\nacquired work skills must be identified, and specific occupations to which\\nthe acquired work skills are transferable must be cited in the State\\nagency’s determination or ALJ’s decision .  Evidence  that these specific\\nskilled or semiskilled jobs exist in significant numbers in the national\\neconomy  should be included (the regulations take administrative notice\\nonly of the existence of unskilled sedent ary, light, and medium jobs in\\nthe national economy ).\\n122\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 00-4p by not asking  the VE if his/her\\ntestimony  was consistent with the DOT.\\nApplicable law:  Most decisions contain the statement: “Pursuant to SSR 00-\\n4p, the vocational expert’s testimony  is consistent with the informati on\\ncontained in the Dictionary  of Occupa tional Titles.”  However, in some cases\\nthe transcript does not document that the ALJ asked the VE whether his or her\\ntestimony  was consistent with the DOT, as required by SSR 00-4p.  Social\\nSecurity  Ruling 00-4p unambig uously  sets out the ALJ’s affirmative duty to\\nboth “ask about any possible conflict between that [vocational expert or\\nvocational specialist]  evidence and information provided in the DOT” and if\\nthe vocational evide nce appears to conflict with the DOT, to obtain a\\nreasonable explanation for the apparent conflict before relying on the VE’s\\ntestimony .  This stems from the ALJ’s duty to “fully  develop the record” and\\nrequires the ALJ to inquire, on the record, as to whether or not the VE’s\\ntestimony  is consistent with the DOT.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ violated SSR 00-4p by not resolving  the conflict between the VE’s\\ntestimony  and the DOT.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  00-4p clarifies the standards for the\\nuse of vocational experts, and discusses the circumstances when the\\noccupational evidence provided by a VE is not consistent with the DOT.  The\\nRuling  states that when there is an apparent unresolved  conflict between the\\ntestimony  of the VE and the DOT, the ALJ is required to elicit a reasonable\\nexplanation for the conflict before relying on the VE’s testimony .  As part of\\nthe ALJ’s duty to “fully  develop the record,” the ALJ is required to inquire,\\non the record, as to whether or not the VE’s testimony  is consiste nt with the\\nDOT.  The Ruling  speci fically states that neither the DOT nor the vocational\\nexpert testimony  “automatically  ‘trumps’ when there is a conflict.”  Id.\\nSSR 00-4p also contains documentation requirements, stating :\\nWhen vocational evidence provided by a VE . . . is not consistent with\\ninform ation in the DOT, the [ALJ] must resolve this conflict before\\nrelying on the VE . . . evidence to support a determination or decision\\nthat the individual is or is not disabled.  The [ALJ] will explain in the\\ndetermination or decision how he or she resolved the conflict.  The ALJ\\nmust explain the resolution of the conflict irrespective of how the conflict\\nwas identified.\\nAdditionally , HAL LEX I -2-6-74(E) instructs:\\nBefore the ALJ may rely on a VE’s testimony to support a disability\\ndecision, the ALJ must inquire on the record whether there are any\\n123\\nconflicts between occupational evidence the VE provided and\\ninformation contained in the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT),\\nincluding  its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of\\nOccupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary  of Occupationa l Titles\\n(SCO), published by the U. S. Department of Labor.  The ALJ must\\nidentify  and obtain a reasonable explanation for any such conflict. The\\nALJ also must explain in the decision how he or she resolved any\\nidentified conflict.  See SSR 00-4p.\\n5.The VE’s testimony  that the claimant, who require s a sit/stand option, could\\nperform lig ht jobs as a [ state jobs]  is not consistent with the DOT.\\nApplicable  law:  The DOT specifies that “standing ” is defined as “being  on\\none’s feet in an uprig ht position without moving  abo  t.” DOT, Appendix\\nC(IV)(a).  Thus, according  to the DOT, jobs defined as “light work” entail\\nstanding  for up to six hours a day in “an upright position without moving\\nabout” and would not allow for a sit/stand option.\\n6.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant is limited to “simple, repetitive\\ntasks,” the VE’s testimony  that the claimant can perform jobs as an office\\nclerk (DOT #209.562-010) [or cashier (DOT #211.462-0 14) or sales attendant\\n(DOT #299.677-010) or surveillance system monitor (DOT #379.367-010),\\netc.] conflicts with the DOT because, according  to the DOT, an individual\\nwho “is limited to simple, unskilled tasks” could not perform any of these\\nfour jobs.\\nApplicable law:  According  to the DOT, work as an office clerk, cashier,\\nsales attendant, and surveillance system monitor all entail a reasoning  at a\\nlevel of “3.”  These functions are part of the General Educational\\nDevelopment (“GED”) of the job, which “embraces those aspects of\\neducation (formal and informal) which are required of the worker for\\nsatisfactory  job performance.”  According  to the DOT, reasoni ng level “1”\\njobs can be performed by an individual who can understand and carry  out\\n“simple” instructions; level “2” jobs can be performed by an individual who\\ncan understand and carry out “detailed but uninvolved written or oral\\ninstructio ns;” and level “3” jobs entail even greater abilities.29  Id.  Thus, jobs\\n29 The reasoning scales range from a low of “1” to a high of “6,”  which are defined as follows: \\nLEVEL 6 - Apply  principles of logical or scientific thinking to a wide range of intellectual and practical\\nproblems. Deal with nonverbal symbolism (formulas, scientific equations, graphs, musical notes, etc.) in its\\nmost difficult phases. Deal with a variety of abstract and concrete variables.

Interpret a variety of instructions\\n124\\nat a reasoning  level of “3,” like those of the office clerk, cashier, sales\\nattendant, and surveillance system monitor entail even more complex  abilities\\nthan perform ing detailed instructions, and certainly  could not be performed by\\nthe claimant, who is limited to simple, unskilled tasks.\\nSocial Security  Ruling  00-4p provides:\\nOccupational evidence provided by a [vocational expert or vocational\\nspecialist]  generally should be consistent with the occupational\\ninformation supplied by the DOT.  When there is an apparent unresolved\\nconflict between VE or VS evidence and the DOT, the adjudicator must\\nelicit a reasonable explanation for the conflict before relying on the VE\\nor VS evidence to support a determination or decision about whether the\\nclaimant is disabled.  At the hearings level, as part of the adjudicator’s\\nduty to fully develop the record, the adjudicator will inquire, on the\\nrecord, as to whether or not there is such consistency .\\nNeither the DOT nor the VE or VS evidence automat ically “trumps”\\nwhen there is a conflict.

MEDICAL  EXPERT TESTIMONY \\n         \\n1.Given the ambig uity in the medical evidence , the ALJ was required to obtain\\nME testimony .  \\n2.Given the evidence suggesting  that the claimant’s impairment(s) medically\\nequal a listing , the AL J was required to obtain ME testimony .\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5- 34(A)(1) provides that the ALJ must obtain\\nan ME opinion, either in testimony  at a hearing  or in responses to written\\ninterrog atories in the following  circumstances:  (1) The Appeals Council or\\nFederal court ordered an ME opinion; (2) There is a question about the\\naccuracy  of medical test results reported, requiring  evaluation  of backg round\\nmedical test data; (3) The ALJ is considering  finding  that the claimant’s\\nimpairment(s) medically  equals a listing . Id.  The regulations provide that\\nALJs “may  also ask for medical eviden ce from expert medical sources” and to\\nconsider such evidence under 20 C.F.R. §§  404.1520b, 404.1520c, 404.1527,\\n416.920b, 416.920c, 416.927.; see also  20 C.F.R. §§  404.1513a(b)(2),\\n416.913a(b)(2).\\n3.The ALJ committed legal error by not notify ing the claimant in advance of the\\nhearing  that a ME was testify ing at the hearing .\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-6-70(A)(Note 1) states that when an ME is\\nscheduled to testify  at a hearing , the hearing  office “staff must notify  the\\n126\\nclaimant of this appearance in the ‘REMARKS ’ section of the Notice of\\nHearing ” and must also specify  the “manner in which the ME will appear.”\\n4.The ALJ committed legal error by not notify ing the claimant that a ME was to\\ntestify  by telephone as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.938(b), 416.1438(b) and\\nthe claimant was prejudiced as the ALJ relied on the ME testimon y and the\\nME never had the opportunity  to hear the claimant’s testimony .\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  regulations provide that the claimant will\\n“be told if [the]  appearance . . . of any other party or witness is scheduled to\\nbe made by video teleconferencing  rather than in person.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.938(b), 416.1438(b).

However, the ME may  respond to questions about the effects\\nof the claimant’s medical treatment on the claimant’s ability  to\\nengage in work related activities.\\nK.CESSAT ION CASE S\\n1.The ALJ erred by not apply ing the “medical improvemen t” standard, prior to\\nconcluding  that “there has been improvement” in the claimant’s medical\\ncondition, as required by  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1594, 416.994.\\nApplicable law :  The reg ulations define “medical improvement” as:\\nany decrease in the medical severity  of your impairment(s) which was\\npresent at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that you\\nwere disabled or continued to be disabled.  A determination  that there has\\nbeen a decrease in medical severity must be based on chang es\\n(improvement) in the symptoms, signs and/or laboratory  finding s\\nassociated with y our impairment(s).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(1), 416.994(b)(1)(i). To apply the medical\\nimprovement standard, the ALJ must first compare the medical severity  of the\\ncurrent impairment(s) to the severity  of the impairme nt(s) which was present\\nat the time of the most recent favorable medical decision finding  the claimant\\ndisabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(7), 416.994(b)(1)(vii).  In order to\\ndetermine whether disability  continues or ends, the ALJ must determine if\\nthere has been any medical improvement in a claimant’s impairment(s) and, if\\n129\\nso, whether this medical improvement is related to the claimant’s ability to\\nwork.  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1594(a), 416.994(b).\\nThe regulations provide that medical improvement is not related to the\\nclaimant ’s ability to work if there has been a decrease in the severity  of the\\nimpairment(s), but no increas e in the claimant’s functional capacity  to do\\nbasic work activities. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1594(b)(2), 416.994(b)(1)(ii).  If there\\nhas been any medical improvement in a claimant’s impairment(s), but it is not\\nrelated to the claimant’s ability  to do work and none of the exceptions applies,\\nthe claimant’s benefits will be continued.  Id.\\nThe regulations include the following  example that can be cited to\\ndemonstrate that the claimant’s condition has not, in fact, improved:\\nExample 1: You were awarded disability  benefits due to a herniated\\nnucleus pulposus.  At the time of our prior decision granting  you benefits\\nyou had had a laminectomy .  Postoperatively , a myelogram still shows\\nevidence of a persistent deficit in your lumbar spine.  You had pain in\\nyour back, and pain and a burning  sensati on in your right foot and leg. \\nThere were no muscle weakness or neurolog ical chang es and a modest\\ndecrease in motion in your back and leg.  When we reviewed your claim\\nyour treating  physician reported that he had seen you regularly every  2 to\\n3 months for the past 2 years. No further myelograms had been done,\\ncomplaints of pain in the back and right leg continued especially  on\\nsitting  or standing  for more than a short period of time.  Your doctor\\nfurther reported a moderately  decreased range of motion in your back and\\nright leg, but again no muscle atrophy  or neurolog ical chang es were\\nreported.  Medic al improvement has not occurred because there has been\\nno decrease in the severity  of your back impairment as shown by chang es\\nin sy mptoms, sig ns or laboratory  finding s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1594(b)(1), 416.994(b)(1)(i).\\n2.As the ALJ failed to exhibit [or cite] to the records from the comparison point\\ndecision, the basis for the medical improvement finding  is unclear, warranting\\nremand  for further consideration.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations require that in a termination case, the ALJ\\nmust  have the prior case file “with the supporting  medical evidence\\npreviously  used to establish or continue your entitlement.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1593(a), 416.993(a).  The reg ulations further provide that:\\nthe medical evidence we will need for a continuing  disability  review will\\nbe that required to make a current determination or decision as to wheth er\\nyou are still disabled, as defined under the medi cal improvement review\\nstandard. See §§ 404.1579 and 404.1594.\\n130\\nId.; see also HAL LEX 1-2-1-13 (B)(1) (stating  that the hearing  staff “will\\nrequest a prior claim(s) file, without needing  to consult with the ALJ” when\\nthe  “pending  claim is before the ALJ based on a continuing  disability\\nreview”) ( citing  20 C.F .R.  §§ 404.1593 and 416.993).\\n3.The ALJ did not follo w the eight-step medical improvement standard\\napplicable in cessation cases as mandated under the reg ulations.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations require the ALJ to follow an eight-step\\nsequential evaluation process in determining  whether a claimant’s medical\\ncondition has improved such that his/her disability has ceased.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1594(f), 416.994(b)(5).  The steps are as follows:\\nStep one:  The ALJ must first determine whether the claimant is engaged\\nin substantial g ainful activity .\\nStep two:  If the claimant is not engaged in “substantial gainful activity ,”\\nthe ALJ must determine whether the claimant suffers from  an impairment\\nwhich meets or equals the severity  of an impairment listed in Appendix  1\\nof the reg ulations.\\nStep three :  If there is no impairment which meets or equals a listing , the\\nALJ must determi ne whether there has been medical improvement. If\\nthere is no decrease in the medical severity , there is no medical\\nimprovement.\\nStep four :  If there has been medical improvement, the ALJ must\\ndetermin e whether such improvement is related to the ability  to work, or\\nwhether there has been an increase in the claimant’ s residual functional\\ncapacity  based on the impairment that was present at the time of the most\\nrecent favorable medical determination.\\nStep five:  If there has been no medical improvement found at step 3 or if\\nat step 4, the medical improveme nt was not related to the ability  to work,\\nthe ALJ must determin e whether any exceptions to the medical\\nimprovement standard exist.  If no exceptions apply , the ALJ will find\\nthat the disability  continues.  If the first group of exceptions applies,\\ncontin ue to step 6.  If an exception from the second group of exceptions\\napplies, the AL J will find that the disability  ended.\\nStep six:  If there has been medica l improvement related to the\\nclaimant’s ability  to work or if one of the first group of exceptions to\\nmedic al improvement applies, the ALJ must determine whether the\\nclaimant currently  has a severe impairment or combination of\\nimpairments.  I f not, the claimant is no long er disabled.\\nStep seven :  If the impairment is severe, the ALJ assesses the claimant’s\\n131\\nRFC based on the claimant’s current impairments, and whether the\\nclaimant can still do the work s/he has performed in the past.  If the\\nclaimant is still capable of doing  such work, the ALJ will find that the\\nclaimant is no long er disabled.\\nStep eight:  If the claimant cannot do the kind of work that s/he\\nperformed in the past, the ALJ must review the claimant’s RFC and\\nhis/her age, education, and work experience to determine whether the\\nclaimant is capable of performing any other work which exists in the\\nnational economy .  If the claima nt can, the ALJ will find that the\\ndisability  ended.  I f not, the disability  continues.\\n4.The ALJ erred by not considering  whether the claimant, whose disability  had\\nalleg edly ceased, was disabled at any time throug h the date of the ALJ’s\\ndecision as required under SSR 13-3p.\\nApplicable law :  Throug h SSR 13-3p, the SSA adopted the holding  in Difford\\nv. Sec’y of Health and Human Servs. , 910 F.2d 1316 (6th Cir. 1990) as its\\nnationwide policy regarding administrative review of cessation\\ndeterminations, interpreting  the Social Security  Act’s references to “now” and\\n“current” to require consideration of whether the claimant was disabled at any\\ntime throug h the date of the adjud icator’s final determination or decision,\\nincluding  the date of the Appeal s Council’s action where it grants review and\\nissues a decision.  The Ruling  also provides that a timely  request to review a\\ncessation decision constitutes a protective filing  and eliminates the need for a\\nnew application with reg ard to the period throug h the final decision.  Id.\\nIn all cases other than those wherein the claimant is found disabled during  the\\nentire period under consideration, “the adjudicator must fully  explain the basis\\nfor the conclusion reached in the determination or decision.”  Id.  This\\nincludes specify ing the month the disability  ended, and, if applicable, the\\nmonth in which a new period of disability  began. Id.  The decision must\\nspecifically  address the initial cessation determination and the claimant’s\\neligibility  or inelig ibility  for a new a period of disability .  Id.\\nK.CHILDREN’S SSI CL AIMS30\\n1.The ALJ erred in not finding  that the child’s [state areas of functioning ] was\\nnot markedly  limited because the medical evidence showed [descri be the\\nevidence] .\\n30 More detailed information about the 2009 Rulings pertaining to children’s SSI claims as well as a chart\\noutlining the various domains and the norms expected for different age groups is contained in the author’s\\npubl ication, Sarah Bohr’ s Pocket Guide to Key Social Security Rulings - 16th Edition. An order form for this\\npubl ication as well as other publ ications is at the back of this book.\\n132\\n2.The ALJ erred in determining  the child claimant’s impairments did not meet\\nor medically  equal Listing *** [state applicable listing ] because [describe the\\nmedical evidence that supports the listing ].\\nApplicable law :  The Social Security  Act provides: \\nAn individual under the age of 18 shall be considered disabled for the\\npurposes of this title if that individual has a medically  determinable\\nphysical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe\\nfunctional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or\\nwhich has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not\\nless than 12 months.\\n42 U.S.C. § 1382c(a) (3)(C)(1).  The regulations provide that a child is\\n“disabled” if the child is not engaged in substantial gainful activity  and has a\\nmedically  determinable physical or mental impairment or com bination of\\nimpairments that results in “marked and severe functional limitations.”  20\\nC.F.R. 416.906.  The “impairment(s) must meet, medically  equal, or\\nfunctionally  equal the  listings” 20 C.F.R. § 416.924(d).  “An impairment\\ncauses marked and severe functional limitations if it meets or medically\\nequals the severity  of a set of criteria for an impairment in the listing s or if it\\nfunctionally  equals a listing .”  Id.  See also 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (defining\\n“functional equivalence”). \\nThe regulations set forth a three-step sequential evaluation process to\\ndetermine whether a child is disabled.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.924 (a)-(d).  First,\\nif a child is engaged in substantial gainful activity , s/he is not disabled.\\nSecond, the child’s impairments must be “severe.”  Finally , the child’s\\nimpairment s must either meet, medically  equal, or functionally  equal in\\nseverity  a listed impairment contained in the L isting  of Impairments.  Id.  \\nAn impai rment is functionally  equal to a listed impairment when it results in\\n“marked” limitations in two domains of functioni ng or an “extreme”\\nlimitation in one domain.  20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(b).  The adjudicator must\\nassess the functional limitations caused by the impairment, that is what the\\nchild cannot do, has difficulty  doing , needs help doing , or is restricted from\\ndoing  because of the impairm ent. In making  this assessment, the “interactive\\nand cumulative effects of all of the impairments” for which there is evidence,\\nincluding  any impairments that are not “severe” are considered.  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.926a(a).  \\nThe reg ulations set forth the following  six domains of function which apply  to\\nall ag e groups: \\n(1)acquiring  and using  information;31\\n31 This domain includes the ability to think, to acquire and use information, visual and verbal reasoning,\\nproblem solving, and idea development. It also includes perceptual, sensorimotor, language and memory\\n133\\n(2)attending  and completing  tasks; 32\\n(3)interacting  and relating  with others;33 \\n(4)moving  about and manipulating  objects;34\\n(5)caring  for y ourself;35 and  \\n(6)health and phy sical well-being .36\\n20 C.F .R. § 416.926a(b)(1).37\\nprocesses necessary to learn.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (g), SSR 09- 3p.\\n32 This domain considers the child’s level of alertness, ability to work at an appro priate pace, allay impulses,\\nand initiate, sustain and change focus. It also includes the capacity to focus on certain stimuli and ignore\\nothers.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (h), SSR 09- 4p.\\n33 This domain assesses all aspects of social interaction and relationships with groups and individuals. This\\nincorporates speech and language skills necessary to communicate effectively. It also includes the ability to\\nrespond to emotional and behavioral cues and form intimate relationships and externalized maladaptive\\nbehaviors.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (i), SSR 09- 5p.\\n34 This domain looks at the child’s ability to perform physical functions like sitting, standing, balancing,\\nshifting weight, bending, crawling, runni ng, and transferring. It also includes the ability to hold, carry, and\\nmanipulate objects, as well as the capacity to plan, remember and execute movements. Also considered are\\nthe child’s coordination, dexterity, and integration of sensory input .  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (j), SSR 09-6p.\\n35 This domain measures the child’s ability to care for his or her physical needs and to maintain a healthy\\nemotional state. It includes the ability to care for one’s own health and safety and to cooperate with others\\nto meet one’s needs. It also incorporates the concept that the child should be developing an increasing sense\\nof independence and co mpetence.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (k), SSR 09- 7p.\\n36 This domain looks at the cumulative physical effects of physical and/or mental impairments. It includes\\nthe effects of chronic illness, including shortness of breath, reduced stamina, pain, and poor growth as well\\nas the impact of therapies, medications, and exa cerbations.  See 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (l), SSR 09- 8p.\\n37 In assessing a child’s functioning in these domains, the adjudicator must request and consider information\\non the following ques tions:\\n  \\n• Wha t activities is the child is able to perform? \\n• Which of the child’s activities are restricted or limited compared to other children the same\\nage who do not have impairments?\\n• Whe re does the child have difficulty with activities - at home, in childcare, at school, or in\\nthe community?\\n• Does the child hav e difficulty independently initiating, sustaining or completing activities?\\n• Wha t kind of help does the child need to do his or her activities, how much help, and how\\noften is it needed?\\n20 C.F.R. § 416.926a (b)(2).\\n134\\nThe regulations define a “marked” limitation as “seriously  interfering ” with\\nthe child’s ability  to inde pendently  initiate, sustain or complete activities.  20\\nC.F.R. § 416.926a(e)(2). A standardized test score between two and three\\nstandard deviations below the norm for the test is one way to meet this\\nstandard. Id. The definition of “extreme ” is “interferes very  seriously ” with\\nthe ability  to function.  20 C.F.R. § 416.926 a(e)(3). A test score at or below\\nthree standard deviations below the norm for the test is one way to meet this\\nstand ard. Id. In addition, the regulations state that SSA will not consider any\\npiece of evidence  in isolation, including  test scores.  20 C.F.R. §\\n416. 926a(e)(4). Instead, the totality  of the evidence must be considered in\\ndetermining  whether the child has marked or ex treme limitations. Id.\\n3.The ALJ erred in the evaluation of the child claimant’s [marked or extreme]\\nlimitations in cognition and speech, and did not apply  SSR 98-1p in\\ncons idering whether the impairments were medically  equal to Listing  2.09,\\neven if not meeting  or equaling  Listing  112.05.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 98-1p describes when a child’s impairment will be\\ndeemed medically  equivalent to L isting  2.09.  \\nA child whose impairment does not meet the capsule definition in Listing\\n112.05 may still be disabled by having  limitations that are medically\\nequivalent to Listing  2.09.  The child may still have a “marked” limitation in\\ncognitive functioning , along  with an impairment that causes a “marked ”\\nspeech limitation, and this combination of limitations “will be found\\nmedically  equivalent to L isting  2.09 in part A of the listing s.”\\nAs explained in SSR 98-1p states that evidence of the severity  of cognitive\\nlimitation “should” include: \\n(1)the results of psycholog ical testing  (which “must” be sufficiently\\ncurrent), with subtest scores, and the psycholog ist’s interpretation of\\nthe results, including  a conclusion reg arding  validity ; and \\n(2)information about learning  achievement and descriptions from medical\\nand lay  sources of the child’s ability  to perform ag e-appropriate,\\ncognitively  related tasks and activities at home and school.\\nEvidence of speech limitation severity  should also include both medical and\\nlay information: \\n(1)comprehensive examinatio n results concerning  the child’s speech\\n(articulation, voice, fluency ); and \\n(2)descriptions of the child’s speech in daily  circumstances from lay  and\\nprofessional sources who have opportunities to listen to the child. \\nA “marked” cognitive limitation can be shown with or without standardized\\n135\\ntest scores.  SSR 98-1p states that, usually , a “marked” cognitive limitation is\\nidentified when standardized intelligence tests yield a valid score two\\nstandard deviations below the norm. In the absence of valid standardized\\nscores, such a limitation is usually  present when  the impairment(s) of a child\\nunder age 3 results in cognitive functioning  at a level that is more than one-\\nhalf but not more than two-thirds of the child’s chronolog ical age; or when the\\nimpairment(s) of a child 3 to 18 interfere(s) seriously  with cognitive\\nfunctioning  (“more than moderate” but “less than extreme” interference).  The\\nrating  given “must be based on all of the relevant evidence in the case\\nrecord.”\\nSSR 98-1p observes that if the evidence available does not use the descriptors\\nemploy ed in the table, or if it is unclear “how the terms are used, it may be\\nnecessary  to contact the source to clarify  the information.”  The Ruling\\nacknowledg es:\\nTerms such as “poor,” “severe,” “mild,” or “marked” may be used in the\\nevidence to describ e a child’s functioning . These terms have different\\nmeaning  to different people. Therefore, when such terms are not\\nillustrated or explained by the evidence, it may be necessary  to contact the\\nsource for an ex planation of their meaning .\\nSSR 98-1p notes that, in order to assure recency  of the evidence, “it may be\\nnecessary  to obtain a consultative ex amination[ .]”\\n4.The ALJ erred in not considering  the “whole child” in evaluating  whether the\\nchild claimant’s impairment(s) were functionally  equivalent to a listed\\nimpairment as required under SSR 09-1p: Determining  Childhood Disability\\nUnder the F unctional Equivalence Rule — The “W hole Child” Approach.\\n5.The ALJ did not “provide sufficient detail” in evaluating  the “whole child” as\\nrequired by  SSR 09-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-1p provides that functional equivalence is measured\\nby considering  the child’ s functioning  as a “whole” first, not by considering\\nthe domain s or individual impairments. “When we evaluate your functioning\\nand decide which domains may be affected by your impairment(s), we will\\nlook first at your activities and limitations and restrictions.” 20 C.F.R.\\n416.926a(c).\\nSSR 09-1p further directs the adjudicator to consider first all of the child’s\\nactual functioning  in all activities and settings while considering  all domains\\nthat are involved in doing  those activities. The following  questions are to be\\nasked:\\n1.How does the child function?\\n2.Which domains are involved in performing  the activities?\\n136\\n3.Could the child’s medically  determinable  impairment(s) account for\\nlimitations in the child’s activities?\\n4.To what degree does the impairment(s) limit the child’s ability  to function\\nage-appropriately  in each domain?  \\nThe adjudicator is directed to rate limitations in a domain based on the\\nanswers to the following  questions:\\n1.How many  of the child’s activities in the domain are limited (for example,\\none, few, several, many , or all)?\\n2.How important are the limited activities to the child’s age-appropriate\\nfunctioning  (for ex ample, basis, marg inally  important, or essential)?\\n3.Where do the limitations occur (for example, only  at home or in all\\nsetting s)?\\n4.What factors are involved in the limited activities (for example, does the\\nchild receive support from a person, medication, treatment, deice, or\\nstructured/supportive setting )?\\nSSR 09-1p. The Ruling  further states, “we do not require our adjudicators to\\ndiscuss all of the considerations in [SSR 09-1p]  in their determinations and\\ndecisions, only  to provide sufficient detail so that any subsequent reviewers\\ncan understand how they  made their finding s.”\\n6.The ALJ committed reversible error in assuming  that because the child\\nsuffered from a combination of impairments, the resulting  limitations must be\\nspread among  several domains when, in fact, they resulted in an “extreme”\\nlimitation in one domain.\\n7.The ALJ erred by only  considering the child’s impairment in a single domain\\nwhen the child’s limitations were demonstrated to have been applicable to\\nmore than one domain.\\nApplicable law :  As set forth in SSR 09-1p:\\nA single impairment, as well as a combination of impairments, may result\\nin limitations that require evaluation in more than one domain. \\nConve rsely, a combination of impairments, as well as a single impairment,\\nmay result in limitations that we rate in only  one domain.\\nThis Ruling  further states that rating  the limitations caused by a child’s\\nimpairment(s) in each and every  domain that is affected is not “double\\nweig hting ” of either the impairment(s) or its effects.  Rather, it recog nizes the\\nparticular effects of the child’s impairment(s) in all domains involved in the\\nchild’s limited activities.\\n137\\n8.In rating  the severity  of the child’s limitations, the ALJ did not take into\\nconsideration the extensiv e help that the child requires to get him/her throug h\\nhis/her school day and be as independent as s/he appears next to his/her peers,\\nas required by  SSR 09-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-1p directs consideration of the type of help or\\nsupp ort a child needs in order to function.  See also 20 C.F.R. 416.924a.  The\\nRuling  explains:\\n[i]f a child needs a person, medica tion, treatment, device, or structured,\\nsupportive setting  to make his functioning  possible or to improve the\\nfunctioning , the child will not be as independent as same-age peers who\\ndo not have impairments. Such a child will have a limitation, even if he is\\nfunctioning  well with the help or support.\\nThe more help or support of any kind that a child receives beyond what\\nwould be expected f or children the same age without impairments, the less\\nindependent the child is in functioning , and the more severe we will find\\nthe limitation to be.\\nSSR 09-1p.\\n9.The ALJ erred in not examining  the child’s limitations “long itudinally ,” as\\nrequired by SSR 09-1p and 20 C.F.R. 416.924a(b)(8) which require SSA to\\nconsider functioning  over time.\\nApplicabl e law:  In evaluating  the severity  of the child’s limitations, the\\neffects of the impairment(s) should be considered “long itudinally  (that is over\\ntime).”  SSR 09-1p.  F or ex ample,\\nIf you have a chronic impairment(s) that is characteriz ed by episodes of\\nexacerbation (worse ning) and remission (improvement), we will consider\\nthe frequency  and severi ty of your episodes of exacerbation as factors that\\nmay be limiting  your functioning .  Your level of functi oning may vary\\nconsiderably  over time.  Proper evaluation of your ability  to function in\\nany domain requires us to take into account any variations in your level of\\nfunctioning  to determine the impac t of your chronic illness on your ability\\nto function over time.\\n20 C.F .R. 416.924a(b)(8).\\n10.The ALJ committed reversible error in according  “little, if any,” weig ht to the\\nopinion of the child claimant’s [treating  nurse practitioner or treating\\nchiropractor or mental health therapist]  as such opinions must be conside red\\nin determining  how the claimant’ s impairment affects functioning , in\\naccordance with SSR 09-2p.\\n138\\n11.The ALJ did not properly  consider to the opinion of the child’s physical\\ntherapist regarding  the child’s physical development, muscle streng th and\\nresulting  severity  of limitation in being  able to engage in age- appro priate\\nphysical activities.\\n12.The opinions of the workers at the child’s care center were improperly\\ndismissed by the adjudicator in violation of SSR 09-2p as they offer a clear\\npicture of how the child functions in his/her day-to-day  environment and\\nshould have been accepted to show the severity  of the child’s impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 09-2p provides that evidence from “other medical\\nsources,”  such as nurse-practitioners, physicians’ assistants, naturopaths,\\nchiropractors, audiolog ists, occupational therapists, physical therapi sts, and\\npsychiatric social workers, may not be used to establish that a child has a\\nmedi cally determinable impairment. However, such evidence may be used “to\\ndetermine the severity  of the impairment(s) and how it affects the child’s\\nability to function compared to children of the same age who do not have\\nimpairments.”\\nAlso, evidence from non-medical sources, such as “parents and careg ivers,\\neducational personnel (for example, teachers, early  intervention team\\nmembers, counselors, developmental center workers, and daycare center\\nworkers), public and private social welfare agency  personnel, and others (for\\nexample, sibling s, friends, neighbors, and clerg y),” will be considered “to\\ndetermine the severity  of the child’s impai rment(s) and how the child\\ntypically  functions compared to children of the same age who do not have\\nimpairments.”  SSR 09-2p.\\n13.The ALJ committed reversib le error in evaluating  whether the child\\nclaimant’s impairment is medically  equivalent to a listed impairment.\\nApplicable Law :  Medical equivalence in children’s SSI claims is determined\\nby comparing  the symptoms, signs, and laboratory  findings about an\\nimpairment, including , where appropriate, any functional limitation s resulting\\nfrom the impairment, with the corresponding  criteria shown for any listing . \\n20 C.F.R. § 416.926(a).  Equivalence in children can be found in cases where\\nthe child has an impairm ent described in the listing , but either (a) one or more\\nof the medical finding s specified in the particular listing  is not specifi ed or (b)\\none or more of the findings is not as severe as that specified in the listing .  20\\nC.F.R. § 416.926(a)(1)(i). Medical equivalence can be found when the\\nmedical finding s relating  to the impairment are at least of equal medical\\nsignificance and (1) a child does not exhibit one or more of the medical\\nfinding s specified in the particular listing , or (2) the child exhibits all of the\\nmedical finding s, but one or more of the findings is not as severe as specified\\nin the listing .  20 C.F.R. § 416.926(a)(1)(i).  Additionally , where a child has\\nan impairment that is not described in the listing, or a combination of\\nimpairments not one of which meets or is medically  equivalent to a listing , the\\nclosest analog ous listed impairment will be used. If the medical finding s are\\n139\\nof “equal medical significan ce” to those in a listed impairment, medical\\nequivalence to the closest listing  will be found.  Id.\\n14.The ALJ committed reversible error in failing  to develop the record by\\nobtainin g any of [child claimant’s]  school records and/or reports from his/her\\nteachers.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that in determining  whether a child\\nis disabled, information from nonmedic al sources, such as “parents, teachers,\\nand other people” must be considered.  20 C.F.R. § 416.924a(a).  The\\nregulations specifically  address the importance of school records:\\n(iii) School.  If you go to school, we will ask for information from your\\nteachers and other school personnel about how you are functioning  there\\non a day-to-day  basis compared to other children your age who do not\\nhave impairmen ts.  We will ask for any reports that the school may have\\nthat show the results of formal testing  or that describe any special\\neducation instruction or services, including  home-based instruction, or any\\naccommodations provided in a reg ular classroom.\\n20 C.F.R. § 416.924a(a)(2)(iii).  The regulations further provide that if the\\nchild attends school, including  preschool, “we will ask your teacher(s ) about\\nyour performance in your activities throughout your school day” and will\\nconsider evidence from your school, “including  teacher questionnaires ,\\nteacher checklists, group achievement testing , and report cards.”  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.924a(b)(7)(ii).  SSR 09-2p states:\\nWe require adjudicators to try to get school records wheneve r they are\\nneeded to make a determination or decision regarding  a child’s disability . \\nWe do not require information from school personnel in every case\\nbecause sometimes we can decide that a child is disabled without it, such\\nas when the child’s impairment(s) meets the requirements of a listing .  We\\nmay also have to make a determination or decision without all or school\\nevidence when we are unable to obtain it.\\n15.The ALJ erred when s/he did not find that the child claimant’s diabetes\\nmellitus, which required daily  insulin, meets the requirements of Listing\\n109.08.38\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p states that children with DM who require daily\\ninsulin and are under age 6 are to be found disabled under  Listing 109.08. \\nThis is because such children are presumed not to have “developed the\\ncognitive ability  for recog nizing and responding  to hypoglycemia symptoms;\\nthat is, they have hypoglycemia unawareness .”  Due to this lack of awaren ess\\n38 Additional arguments pertaining to SSR 14-2p as it relates to children are addressed unde r “Spe cific\\nImpairments,” Section III, Section D, addressing “Endo crine Disorders (Other than Diabetes Mellitus), infra,\\nat pages 150- 54.\\n140\\nand the life-thr eatening  conditions that can result, these children need near-\\nconstant visual contact from parents or caregivers.  Therefore, they have\\nimpairments that meet listing  109.08.”  After attainment of age 6, however, no\\nsuch presumption exists because ordinarily  “children develop the cognitive\\nability  for recog nizing and responding  to their hypoglycemia symptoms by\\nage 6.”\\nM.YOUNG  ADUL TS’ CL AIMS\\n1.The ALJ erred by not adhering  to the rules for the evaluation of the young\\nadult claimant’s case pursuant to SSR 11-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 11-2p addresses the adjudication of disability  claims\\nwhere the claimant is a young  adult— an individu al between 18 and\\napprox imately  25 years of age.  Whereas the same definition of disability  is\\nused for young  adults and other adults, the Ruling  notes that the evidence SSA\\nconsiders when it makes “disability  determinations for young  adults is\\ngenerally  the same as, or similar to, the evidence [it] consider[ s] for making\\ndisabili ty determinations for older adolescents under title XVI.”  Id.  The\\nRuling  recog nizes that often, young  adults have the same types of\\nimpairments as children, such as attention deficit/hy peractivity  disorder.  The\\nRuling  confirm s SSA will consider all medically  determinable impairments\\n“the y oung  adult has, including  [those]  that are usually  found in children.”  Id.\\nAcknowledg ing that work “requires a person to be able to do the tasks of a job\\nindependently , appropriately , effectively , and on a sustained basis[ ,]”  SSR\\n11-2p also states “the analy sis for adult disability  determin ation purposes is\\nsimilar to our ‘extra help’ rules for children.” Id.; see 20 C.F.R. §\\n416.924a(b)(5)(ii).  So long as the young  adult would need “greater\\nsupervision or assistance, or some other type of accommodation, because of”\\nan impairment “than an employ ee who does not have an impairment, the adult\\nhas a work-related limitation.” Id.  The more support needed, the more severe\\nthe limitation.  Id.\\n2.The ALJ did not properly  consider the evidence from the young  adult\\nclaimant’s former teachers or community  experiences as required by SSR 11-\\n2p.\\n3.The ALJ erred by ignoring the extra help and accommodations the young\\nadult claimant requires, as set forth in SSR 11-2p.\\nApplicable law:  Concerni ng sources of information bearing  on a young\\nadult’s ability to work, SSR 11-2p acknowledg es that evidence from medical\\nsources other than “acceptable medical sources” can prove valuable for\\ndetermining  the severity  of an impairment established throug h an acceptab le\\nmedical source.  The Ruling  discusses in detail various cons iderations for\\nevaluating impairment-related functional limitations, including  1) evidence\\n141\\nfrom  educational prog rams; 2) community  experiences; 3) psychosocial\\nsupports and special setting s; 4) extra help and accommodations; and 5) work-\\nrelated stress.\\nN. GENETIC TESTING\\n1.The ALJ abrog ated his/her legal responsibility  to consider genetic test\\nevidence supportive of disability  as described in SSR 16-4p.\\nAppli cable Law:  SSR 16-4p addresses genetic test evidence and explains\\nthat such evidence can be part of the objecti ve medical evidence used to\\nestablish an impairment.  Specifically , so long  as the results come from an\\nacceptable medical source and are not derived from direct to consumer tests,\\ngenetic testing  can be used to establis h the existence of a medically\\ndeterminable impairment.\\nThe Ruling  also notes that in addition to aiding  diagnosis of particular\\ndiseases or disord ers, genetic tests “assist in predicting  the extent of disease\\nfeatures or risk of developing  a certain disorder [and]  aid in therapy [.]” Id. \\nThere are now tens of thousands of genetic tests available, allowing for the\\nidentification of thousands of genetic disorders.  With the “exception of non-\\nmosaic Down syndrome, genetic test results alone are not sufficient to make a\\ndisability  determination or decision.”  Id.  In other cases, althoug h the SSA\\nwill not specifi cally order genetic testing  as part of a consultative\\nexamination, genetic test results may supply  part of the evidence of disability .\\nConformation of genetic abnormalities can help in assessing  the consistency\\nor supportability  of alleg ed sy mptoms and limitations.\\n2.The ALJ mistakenly  disreg arded genetic test evidence supportive of the\\nmedically  determinable impairment of *** as required under SSR 16-4p.\\nApplicable Law :  SSR 16-4p addresses genetic test evidence and explains\\nthat such evidence can be part of the objective medical  evidence used to\\nestablis h an impairment.  Specifically , so long  as the results come from an\\nacceptable medical source and are not derived  from direct-to consumer tests,\\ngenetic testing  can be used to establish the existence of a medically\\ndeterminable impairment.\\nIII.

Section 105(a)(1)(c) of\\nthe Act provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]n individual shall not be\\nconsidered to be disabled for purposes of this title if alcoholism or drug\\naddiction would (but for this subp aragraph) be a contributing  factor to the\\nALJ’s determination that the individual is disabled.”\\nFollowing  the enactm ent of the Right to Work Act, the Office of Disability  of\\nthe Social Security  Administration issued a telety pe entitled “Questions and\\nAnswers Concerning  DAA from July 2, 1996 Teleconference – Medical\\nAdjudicators--ACTI ON,” dated August 30, 1996 (the “Emerg ency Telety pe”). \\nThe Emerg ency Telety pe states that if mental impairments cannot be\\nseparated from alcohol or drug addiction, a finding  of “not material” is\\nappropriate when making the materiality  determination.  Id.  This rationale\\nextended to SSR 13-2p, in Question 7, “If the evidence in the case record does\\nnot demonstrate the separate effects of the treatment for DAA and for the co-\\noccurring  mental disorder(s), we will find that DAA is not material . . . .”  \\nThe Social Securi ty regulations provide that the key factor to examine in\\nmaking this determination is whether SSA would still find a claimant disabled\\nif the claimant stopped using  drugs or alcohol.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1535,\\n416.935.  SSA is required to evaluate which of the claimant’s current physical\\nand mental limitations, upon which it based the curre nt disability\\ndetermination, would remain if the claimant stopped using  drugs or alcohol. \\nSSA will then determine whether any or all of the claimant’s remaining\\nlimitations would be disabling . Only  if the remaining  limitations would not be\\ndisabling , will SSA find that drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing\\nfactor material to the determination of disability .  Id.\\nSSR 13-2p emphasiz es that DAA  is not material where the claimant would\\nstill be disabled in the absence of drug or alcohol use.  Where a history  of\\nDAA exists that is not relevant to the period under consideration, there  is not\\neven a need for a materiality  determination.  Id.  Similarly , where the claimant\\nhas a disabling  impairment(s) unrelated to, and not exacerbated by DAA, or\\nthat is irreversible, DAA is not material and no further development of DAA\\nevidence is appropriate.  Id.\\nPursuant to SSR 13-2p, the best evidence  for determining  the effect of\\nabstaini ng is ordinarily  evidence from a relevant period of abstinence. Indeed,\\nthe Ruling  cautions:\\nAdjudicators should generally  not rely on a medical opinion to find that\\nDAA is material if the case record contains credible evidence from an\\nacceptable medical source from a relevant period of abstinence indica ting\\nthat the impairment(s) would still be disabling  in the absence of DAA.  In\\ncases in which it is appropriate to rely on a medic al opinion to find that\\n143\\nDAA is material despite evidence indicating  the impairment(s) may not\\nimprove, adjudi cators must provide an appropriate rationale to resolve the\\napparent conflict in the evidence.\\nId.  Further, DAA is not to be deemed material where the fully  developed\\nrecord fails to establish that abstinence would improve the claimant’s physical\\nimpairment(s) to the point of nondisability .  Id.\\n2.The ALJ committed legal error in not first determining  whether the claimant\\nis disabled before finding  that alcoholism is a “contributing  factor material” to\\nan otherwise favorable disability  determination.\\nApplicable law:  In determining  whether alcoholism is a “contributing  factor\\nmaterial” to an otherwise favorable disability  determination, the ALJ is\\nrequired to first determine whether the claimant is disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1535, 416.935.  This is done by using  the five-step sequential evalua tion\\nprocess, without segregating out any effects that might be due to substance\\nuse disorders, and the determination must be based on the claimant’s medical\\nlimitations without deductions for the assumed effects of substance use\\ndisorders.  Only  after determining  what limitations would remain in the\\nabsence of alcoholism or drug  addiction, may the ALJ then reach a conclusion\\non whether the claimant’s substance abuse is a contributing  material factor to\\nthe disability  determination.  Id.\\n3.The ALJ erred by determining  that the claimant has [a drug addiction]\\n[alcoholism] .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p observes that drug  addiction and alcoholism\\n(DAA) is diagnosed in part by the presence of maladaptive use of alcohol,\\nilleg al drug s, prescription medications, or toxic substance s.  DAA thus does\\nnot include (1) fetal alcohol syndrome; (2) fetal cocaine exposure; or (3)\\naddiction  to, or use of, prescription medications taken as prescribed.  Id.  The\\nRuling  clarifies that occasional maladaptive use, or a history  of occasional\\nprior maladaptive use does not establish a medically  determinabl e Substance\\nUse Disorder.  Id.  A claimant has DAA only where s/he has a medically\\ndeterminable Substance Use Disorder, which is decided using  the same rules\\nas for any  other medically  determinable impairment.  Id.\\n4.The ALJ reversibly  erred by assuming  the claimant’s mental disorder would\\nimprove in the absence of drug  or alcohol use.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p differentiates between physical impairments and\\nmental impairments for the purpose of assessing  materiality .  Certain physical\\nimpai rments are recog nized as likely  to improve with abstinence, such as\\nalcoholic hepatitis,  fatty liver, and alcoholic cardiomy opathy . Id. Where the\\nclaimant has another impairment(s) that is mental in natur e, the situation is\\ndifferent. SSR 13-2p concedes “[w]e do not know of any research data that we\\ncan use to predict reliably  that any given claimant’s co-occurring  mental\\n144\\ndisorder would improve, or the extent to which it would improve, if the\\nclaimant were to stop using drugs or alcohol.”  Id.  Therefore, “[u]nlike cases\\ninvolving  physical impairments, we do not permit adjudicators to rely\\nexclusively  on medical expertise and the nature of a claimant’s mental\\ndisorder.”  Id.  To support a finding  that DAA is material in cases involving\\nmental impairment(s), there must be other evidence in the case record\\nestablishing  the claimant would not be disabled in the absence of DAA.  Id.\\n5.The ALJ erred by assuming  improvement of a mental disorder during  a period\\nof abstinence from [ drug s] [alcohol]  indicates materiality .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p cautions that improvement of a co-occurring\\nmental disorder that occurs “in a highly structured treatment setting, such as a\\nhospital or substance abuse rehabilitation center, may be due at least in part to\\ntreatment for the co-occurring  mental disorder, not (or not entirely ) the\\ncessation of substance use.”  The Ruling  states:\\nA co-occurring  mental disorder may appear to improve because of the\\nstructur e and support provided in a highly structured treatment setting .  As\\nfor any mental disorder,  we may find that a claimant’s co-occurring\\nmental disorder(s) is still disabling  even if increased support or a highly\\nstructured setting  reduce the overt sy mptoms and sig ns of the disorder.\\nId.  Unless the evidence demonstrates “the separate effects of the treatment\\nfor DAA and for the co-occurring  mental disorder(s), we will find that DAA\\nis not material[ .]”  The Ruling  concludes:\\nGiven the foreg oing principles, a single hospital ization or other inpatient\\nintervention is not sufficient to establish that DAA is material when there\\nis evidence that a claima nt has a disabling  co- occurring  mental\\ndisorder(s).  We need evidence from outside of such highly structured\\ntreatment setting s demonstrating  that the claimant’s co-occurring  menta l\\ndisorder(s) has improved, or would  improve, with abstinence. In addition,\\na record of multiple hospitaliz ations, emergency  department visits, or\\nother treatmen t for the co-occurring  mental disorder — with or without\\ntreatment for DAA — is an indication that DAA may not be material even\\nif the claimant is discharg ed in improved condition after each intervention.\\n6.The ALJ did not recog nize the importance of evidence from “other” sources\\nin assessing  the severity  and materiality  of the claimant’s drug addiction or\\nalcoholism.\\nAppl icable law:  SSR 13-2p acknowledg es that many  claimants receive care\\nfrom sources that are not acceptable medical sources, and that evidence from\\nthese sources can be helpful in determining  the severity  of DAA and whether\\nDAA is material to the finding  of disabilit y.  This information can describe a\\nclaimant’s function ing over time and be especially  helpful in documenting  the\\nseverity  of DAA and can assist in the determination of materiality  by\\n145\\ndocumenting how well the claimant performs daily  living  activities in the\\npresence of a comorbid impairment.  Id.  The Ruling  recog nizes that “[i]n\\nmany cases, evidence from ‘other’ sources may be the most impor tant\\ninformation in the case record for these documentation issues.”  Id.\\n7.The ALJ did not ident ify substantial evidence to support the finding s made as\\nto the claimant’s [ drug  addiction]  [alcoholism]  as required by  SSR 13-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-2p requires adjudica tors to provide sufficient\\ninformation that a subsequent reviewer considering  the evidence of record can\\nunderstand the reasons for: (1) the finding  that the claimant has DAA; (2) the\\nfinding  that the claimant is disabled at step 3 or step 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process considering  all of his or her impairments, including  DAA;\\nand (3) the finding  that the claimant would still be disabled at step 3 or 5 of\\nthe sequential evaluation process in the absence of DAA, or the finding  that\\nthe claimant would not be disabled at step 2, 4, or 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process in the absence of DAA. This information must be provided\\nby the ALJ, or by the Appeals Council (when the Appeals Council makes a\\ndecision), in the decision rationale.  Id.\\nB.CHRONIC FAT IGUE SYNDRO ME (CFS) (SSR 14-1p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 14-1p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s chronic fatig ue sy ndrome.\\n2.The Appeals Council should remand this case with instructions to evaluate the\\nclaimant’s CF S in accordance with SSR 14-1p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-1p restates and clarifies the ALJ’s policies for\\nevaluating  disability  based on CFS.  CFS is defined as a “systemic disord er\\nconsisting  of a complex  of symptoms that may vary in incidence, duration,\\nand severity” which is characteriz ed in part by “prolong ed fatigue lasting  6\\nmonths or more, resulting  in a substantial reduction in previous levels of\\noccupational, educational, social, or personal activities.”  It is diagnosed “only\\nafter alternative medical and psychiatric causes of chronic fatig uing  illness\\nhave been ex cluded.”  Id.\\nThe Ruling  explains that CFS, when accompanied by appropriate medical\\nsigns or laboratory  finding s, is a medical ly determinable impairment that can\\nbe the basis for a finding  of “disability .”  In evaluating  a claim of CFS, the\\nexistence of one or more of the following  medical signs, clinically\\ndocumented over a period of at least 6 consecutive months, help establish a\\nmedically  determinable impairment:\\n•Palpably  swollen or tender lymph nodes on physical examination;\\nNonex udative phary ngitis;\\n146\\n•Persistent, reproducible muscle tenderness on repea ted examinations,\\nincluding  the presence of positive tender points; or\\n•Any other medical signs that are consistent with medically  accepted\\nclinical practice and are consistent with the other evidence in the case\\nrecord. For example, an acute infectious inflammatory  event preceding\\nonset of CFS, or signs such as frequent viral infections with prolong ed\\nrecovery , sinusitis, ataxia, extreme pallor, and pronounced weig ht\\nchang e.\\nSSR 14-1p  further provides that an individual with CFS can also exhibit a\\nwide rang e of other manifestations, including :\\nmuscle weakness, sleep disturbances, visual difficu lties (trouble focusing\\nor severe photosensitivity ), orthostatic intolerance (e.g., lightheadedness,\\nfainting , dizziness, or increased  fatigue with prolong ed standing ),\\nrespiratory  difficulties, cardiovascular abnormalities, gastrointestinal\\ndiscomfort, and urinary  or bladder problems.\\nSSR 14-1p contains examples of laboratory  finding s that establish the\\nexistence of a medically  determinable  impairment of CFS, recog nizing that\\n“there are no specific laboratory  finding s that are widely accepted as being\\nassociated with CFS.”  Id.  Thus, “the absence of a definitive test does not\\npreclude . . . reliance upon certain laboratory  finding s to establish the\\nexistence of a [ medically  determinable impairment]  in people with CF S.”  Id.\\nThis Ruling  also acknowledg es that “[s]ome with CFS report ongoing\\nproblems with short-term memory , information processing , visual-spatial\\ndifficulties, comprehension, concentra tion, speech, word-finding , calculation,\"\n",

Other symptoms of\\nthis type “include cuts or bruises that are slow to heal, numbness in the hands\\nand feet, or recurrent infections of the skin, gums, or bladder.”  Daily insulin\\nmight be required when diet and weig ht loss alone prove insufficient.\\nSSR 14-2p discusses the symptoms and compli cations of DM, along  with\\nrelated conditions such as obesity that can interact with the disease and cause\\nmore severe problems than each acting  alone.  Occurrences of hyperglycemia\\n(high blood glucose) cause such symptoms as frequent urination, blurred\\nvision, headaches, difficulty  concentrating , and abdominal pain or nausea.\\nSSR 14-2p also discusses hypoglycemia (low blood glucose), which causes\\nsymptoms and signs such as weakness, hung er, sweating , trembling ,\\nnervousness, palpitations, difficulty  with concentration, and additional\\nsymptoms in young  childr en.  The Ruling  acknowledg es that without proper\\ntreatment, the condition can becom e severe and even lead to permanent brain\\ndamag e or death.  An important consideration is whether the individual\\nexperiences hypogl ycemia unawareness, a dangerous condition that\\n“generally  occur s in people who have had DM for a long  time and\\nexperienced many  episod es of hypoglycemia.” Hypoglycemia unawareness\\n“puts a person at risk for severe hy poglycemia-related complications.”\\n2.The ALJ did not consider the impact of the claiman t’s obesity  on his/her\\ndiabetes mellitus on his/her ability  to work as required by SSR 14-2p and SSR\\n19-2p, which addresses the interaction between DM and obesity .\\nApplic able law:  SSR 14-2p recog nizes that “a person with DM and obesity\\nmay have more severe complicati ons than the effects of each of the\\nimpairments considered separately .”  More generally , SSR 14-1p states that\\n“[t]he combined effects of DM and another impairment(s) can be greate r than\\nthe effects of each of the impairments considered separately .”\\n  3.The ALJ did not comply with SSR 14-2 p in not addressing whether the\\nclaimant’s diabetes mellitus equals a listed impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p explains that while DM is not a listed\\nimpairment  for adults or children 6 and older, it may meet or equal a listing .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that chronic hyperg lycemia leads to complications\\nincluding  diabetic retinopathy , cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy ,\\nand diabetic neurop athy.  These complications may lead to the meeting  or\\nequaling of a listed impairment. An acute complication of hyperglycemia is\\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, which can be fatal.\\n148\\n4.The ALJ erred when s/he did not find that the child claimant’s diabetes\\nmellitus, which requires daily  insulin, meets the requirements of Listing\\n109.08.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p states that children with DM who require daily\\ninsulin and are under age 6 are to be found disabled under Listing  109.08. \\nThis is because such children are presumed not to have “developed the\\ncognitive ability  for recog nizing and responding  to hypoglycemia symptoms;\\nthat is, they have hypoglycemia unawareness .”  Due to this lack of awareness\\nand the life-threatening  conditions that can result, these children need near-\\nconstant visual contact from parents or caregivers.  Therefore, they have\\nimpairments that meet listing  109.08.”  After attainment of age 6, however, no\\nsuch presumption exists because ordinarily  “children develop the cognitive\\nability  for recog nizing and responding  to their hypoglycemia symptoms by\\nage 6.”\\n5.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s diabetes mellitus may equal a listed\\nimpairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p explains that while DM is not a listed\\nimpairment for children 6 and older, it may meet or equal a listing . Children 6\\nand older are evaluated on a case-by -case basis to ascertain whether they have\\ndeveloped awareness of their hypoglycemia symptoms.  Adjudicators must\\n“evaluate on an individual case basis whether children age 6 and older have\\ndeveloped cognitive awareness of their hypoglycemia symptoms” because\\nwithout this awareness, children who require daily  insulin require 24-hour-a-\\nday adult  supervision for medical reasons and are to be considered disabled\\nunder the functional equivalence rules.\\nThe current listing  of impairm ents  addresses DM in children 6 and older. \\nListing  109.00(C) provides:  \\nC. How do we evaluate DM in children?  Listing  109.08 is only for\\nchildren with DM who have not attained age 6 and who require daily\\ninsulin. For all other childr en (that is, children with DM who are age 6 or\\nolder and require daily  insulin, and children of any age with DM who do\\nnot require daily  insulin), we follow our rules for determining  whether the\\nDM is severe, alone or in combination with another impairment, whether\\nit meets or medically  equals the criteria of a listing in another body\\nsystem, or functionally  equals the listing s under the criteria in § 416.926a\\nof this chapter, considering  the factors in § 416.924a of this chapter. The\\nmanag ement of DM in children can be compl ex and variable from day to\\nday, and all children with DM require some level of adult supervisio n. For\\nexample, if a child age 6 or older has a medical need for 24-hour-a-day\\nadult supervision of insulin treatment, food intake, and physical activity  to\\nensure survival, we will find that the child’s impairment functionally\\nequals the listing s based on the example in § 416.926a(m)(2) of this\\nchapter.\\n149\\n6.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s diabetes mellitus may affect  a\\nchild’s functioning  in any  domain.\\nApplica ble law:  SSR 14-2p discusses how DM, alone or in combination\\nwith other impairments, may affect a child’s functioning  in any domain. \\nThe Ruling  proceeds to discuss examples  of interference with a child’s\\nabilities within the various domains, including  problem s arising  from\\nfatig ue, lack of concentration, or embarrassment.\\nD. ENDO CRINE  DISO RDE RS (OTHER THAN DIAB ETES\\nMELLITUS) (SSR 14-3p)40\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with the provisions of SSR 14-3p which provides\\nguidance for the proper evaluation of endocrine disorders (other than diabetes\\nmellitus).\\nApplicable law:  As SSR 14-3p notes, in 2011 the listing s for endocrine\\ndisorders were removed as obsolete.  This Rulin g supplies the guidance\\npromised at that time reg arding  the proper evaluation of such disorders.\\nSSR 14-3p notes that either too much or too little of a hormone from an\\nendocrine  gland can cause an endocrine disorder, resulting  in myriad\\ncomplications .  The Ruling  addresses disorders of the pituitary , thyroid,\\nparathy roid, and adrenal glands, as well as noting  pancreatic and gonadal\\ndisorders.  Symptoms, signs and/or treatment are identified for each.  In\\ndiscussing  the evaluation of these disorders during  the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, SSR 14-3p notes that the effects of various endocrine gland disorders\\nare relevant to the assessment of whether a listing  has been met or equaled,\\nand provides eight examples for adults, nine for children.  Howeve r,\\nendocrine disorders are not themselves listed impairments for adults, nor for\\nchildren apart from diabetes in young children (a disorde r addressed in SSR\\n14-2p).\\nSSR 14-3p address es disorders of the pituitary , thyroid, parathy roid, and\\nadrenal glands, in addition to briefly  mentioning  pancreatic and gonadal\\ndisorders.  In relation  to the first four, both hypofunction and hyperfunction\\nare discussed.  For example, hyperpituitarism may result in gigantism in\\nchildren and adults may develop acromeg aly.  Signs and symptoms of\\nacromeg aly can include joint pain or swelling  and vision abnormalities. \\nHypopituitarism , on the other hand, if associated with deficient production of\\nantidiuretic hormo ne may result in diabetes insipidus with excessive\\nurination, dehy dration, and electroly te imbalance.\\nHyperthy roidism, which may abnormally  increase the body’s metabolic rate,\\ncan produce altered mood, tremors1, heart palpitations, hypertension, weigh t\\n40Diabetes mellitus is addre ssed in SSR 14- 2p. \\n150\\nloss, bulging eyes, and goiter. Nevertheless, treatment normally  controls these\\nsymptoms and signs within 12 months.  Hypothyroidism, potentially\\nresponsible for weakness, fatig ue, dry or coarse skin, slow or depressed\\nspeech, and adverse mental chang es, can also generally be treated successfully\\nin less than 12 months.\\nOveractivity  of the parathy roid gland can cause cons tipation, nausea,\\nvomiting , fatig ue, osteoporosis, and kidney  stones.  According  to the Ruling ,\\n“[t]reatment includes surgical removal of the gland(s), which usually  resolves\\nthe problem.”   Hypoparathy roidism, which can “generally ” be controlled by\\nlifelong treatment with supplements and a special diet, can result in muscle\\ncramps, muscle spasms, ex cessive nervousness, and headaches.\\nThe Ruling  states that another group of disorders generally  controlled by\\ntreatm ent are those involving  dysfunction of the adrenal glands. Symptomatic\\nhyperadrenalism is characteriz ed by dysmorphic body chang es, increased\\nfacial and body hair in women, and the reduced ability  to fight infections. \\nHypoadrenalism is characteriz ed by generaliz ed weakness  and fatig ue,\\ndarkening  of skin, muscle wasting , loss of appetite, low blood pressure,\\nelectroly te imbalance, and depression.\\nPancreatic disorders are not discu ssed in detail in this Ruling  as diabetes\\nmellitus is specifically  covered by SSR 14-2p.  Lastly, SSR 14-3p notes that\\ncong enital gonadal dysfunction “is frequently  associated with chromosomal\\ndisorders or other genetic syndromes. Treatment involves lifelong hormone\\nreplacement therapy , which usually  controls this condition.”\\n2.The ALJ did not properly  consider whether the claimant’s endocrine disorder\\n(other than diabetes mellitus) may  equal a listed impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-3p offers examples of the effects of specific\\nendocrine disorders and the body  systems for evaluation:\\nHyperpituitarism :  Compromised use of the extremi ties due to\\ncomplications of boney  structures, under the musculoskeletal system\\nlisting s (1.00).\\nHypopituitarism :  ADH deficie ncy that is untreated or unresponsive to\\ntreatment resulting  in heart  failure or arrhy thmia, under the cardiovascular\\nsystem listings (4.00).\\nHyperthyroidism :  Irregular heartbeat or other cardiac dysfunction, under\\nthe cardiovascular system listing s (4.00);

and\\nintellectual disability  or other cognitive disorders resulting  from\\ninadequately  treated hypothy roidism, under the mental disorders listing s\\n(1200.00).\\n4.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s endocrine disorder (other than \\ndiabetes mellitus) may  affect a child’s functioning  in any  domain.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-3p observes that “[a]n endocrine disorder, alone or\\nin combination with another impairment(s), may affect a child’s functioning\\nin any domain.”  The Ruling  procee ds to discuss examples of interference\\nwith a child’s abilities within the various domains.\\nExamples given are that of a child with: (1) an inadequately  treated thyroid\\ndisorder  who may have limitations in attending  and completing  tasks due to\\n153\\ndifficulty  listening to the teacher, maintaining  focus, staying on task in the\\nclassroom, or excessive fatig ue; (2) panhy popituitarism after surgery for\\ncraniophary ngioma (a benig n tumor near the pituitary  gland), who may\\nexperience partial bilateral loss of visual fields and thus have  difficulty\\nmoving  about and manipulating  objects; (3) inadequately  treated growth\\nhormone deficiency  who may appear much young er than their chron ological\\nage and as a result have difficulty  interacting  and relating  with others, or have\\ndifficulty  shopping  or getting  an after school job because of being mistakenly\\nperceived as a much y oung er child.\\nE.FIBROMYAL GIA (FM ) (SSR 12-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 12-2p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s fibromy algia.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p sets forth three requirements for Fibromy algia\\nitself to be considered a medically  determinable impairment: a physician has\\ndiagnosed fibromy algia; (2) the physician has provided the evidence\\ndescribed either by the 1990 American Colleg e of Rheumatolog y (ACR)\\ncriteria or the 2010 ACR Preliminary  Diagnostic Criteria; and (3) the\\nphysician’s “diag nosis is not inconsistent with the other evidence in the\\nperson’s case record.”  Id.\\nSSR 12-2p recognizes the “considerable overlap” between the symptoms\\npresent in CFS and Fibromyalgia.  It explains that individuals with CFS who\\nhave tender points have a medically  determinable impairment, and that\\nclaimants with “impairments that fulfill the American Colleg e of\\nRheumatol ogy criteria for [Fibromy algia Syndrome]  (which includes a\\nminimum number of tender points) may also fulfill the criteria for CFS.”  Id. \\nThe Ruling  also states that, even in cases where the claimant does not have\\nthe tender points sufficient to establ ish Fibromy algia Syndrome, they “will\\nstill be found to have a medically  determinable impairment.”  Id.\\n2.The ALJ erred in not considering  the long itudinal record in evaluating  the\\nseverity  of the claiman t’s FM as SSR 12-2p recog nizes that FM symptoms\\ncan wax  and wane, with g ood and bad day s. \\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p twice emphasiz es the importance of long itudinal\\ninformation due to its recog nition that fibromy algia can involve varying signs\\nand symptoms.  First, it states that if a consultative examiner is hired, the CE\\nshould have access to long itudinal inform ation, as “the symptoms and signs of\\n[fibromy algia] may vary in severi ty over time and may even be absent on\\nsome days[.]”  Id.  Second, in discussing  the assessment of residual functional\\ncapacity , the Ruling  again stresses the importance of considering  “a\\nlongitudinal record whenever possible because the symptoms of\\n[fibromyalgia] can wax and wane so that a person may have ‘bad days and\\ngood day s.’”  Id.\\n154\\n3.Since fibromy algia is not a listed impairment, the ALJ must determine\\nwhether FM medically  equals a listing  or whether it medically equals a listing\\nin combination with at least one other medically  determinable impairment as\\nmandated under SSR 12-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p observes that while fibromyalgia cannot meet a\\nlisting  since there is no listing  for the condit ion, adjudicators must consider\\nwhether it medically equals a listing .  Id.  The Ruling  points to Listing\\n14.09D, which pertains to inflammatory  arthritis, as an example of a listing\\nthat might be equaled by a claimant suffering  from fibromy algia. Id. Further ,\\nthe Ruling  alludes to the possibility  that fibromy algia might equal a listing\\nwhen considered in combination with one or more other impairments.  Id.\\nF.  HEADACH ES (SSR 19-4p)\\n 1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s primary headaches are not a medically\\ndeterminable impairment is not consistent with SSR 19-4p.\\n2.The ALJ’s finding s regarding  the severity  of the claimant’s primary\\nheadaches do not comply  with SSR 19-4p.\\n3.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s [list type of headache]  are not a severe\\nimpairment is not consistent with SSR 19-4p as the record documents all\\nrequired finding s for this ty pe of headache.\\nApplicab le law:  Applicable to new applications filed on or after August 26,\\n2019, and to cases remanded from federal courts after that date, SSR 19-4p\\ndiscusses the evaluation by SSA of primary  headache disorders, including\\nmigraines, episodic and chronic tension-ty pe headaches, and trigeminal\\nautonomic cephalalg ias.  The Ruling  notes that in 2018 the third edition of the\\nInternational Classification of Heada che Disorders (“ICHD”) was published,\\nand that the Ruling  is based partly  on the criteria identified in this publication. \\nThe information in SSR 19-4p is presented in question and answer format.   \\n  \\nThe Ruling  notes that headaches may invo lve pain the scalp or neck rather\\nthan strictly  the head, and defines prim ary headaches as those occurring\\nindependently  of other medical conditions.  It discusses migraines, which it\\nclassifies as vasc ular headaches with or without aura; episodic and chronic\\ntension-ty pe headaches; and trigeminal autonomic cephalalg ias, which\\ninvolve one-sided pain, the most common being  clust er headaches.  SSR 19-\\n4p then specifies the diagnostic criteria for: migraine with aura, migraine\\nwithout aura, chronic tension-ty pe headaches , and cluster headaches.  This\\ncriteria is as follows:\\nMigraine with aura:  Migraine with aura are headaches not better accounted\\nfor by another ICHD diagnosis, as including  at least two headache attacks\\nwith at least one reversible aura symptom (visual, sensory , speech or\\n155\\nlanguage, motor, brainstem, retinal) and at least three of the following : one or\\nmore aura symptoms spreads gradually  over at least 5 minutes; two or more\\naura symptoms occur in succession; each aura symptom lasts 5 to 60 minutes;\\none or more aura symptoms is unilateral; one or more aura symptoms is\\npositive; or the aura is accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by\\nheadache.\\nMigraine without aura:  The diagnostic criteria for migr aine without aura\\nrequire at least five headache attacks lasting  4 to 72 hours and characteriz ed\\nby at least two of the following : unilateral location; pulsating  quality ;\\nmoderate or severe pain intensity ; or aggravation by or causing  avoidance of\\nroutine physical activity .  In addition, one or more of the following  must be\\npresent during  a heada che: nausea; vomiting ; or photophobia and\\nphonophobia .  SSR 19-4p also explains how to calculate the duration of a\\nmigraine attack, noting  that when the person falls asleep during  a migraine\\nand wakes up without it, the duration of the attack is measured up until the\\ntime of awakening\\nChronic tension-type headaches :  Chronic tension-ty pe headaches must\\noccurr, and have at least two of the following  characteristics: bilateral\\nlocation; pressing or tightening  quality ; mild or moderate intensity ; or not\\naggravated by routine physical activity .  Additionally , there may be “no more\\nthan one of photop hobia, phonophobia, or mild nausea; and [n]either\\nmoderate nor severe nausea nor vomiting .”  (footnote omitted).\\nCluster headaches :  Regarding  cluster headache, at least five headache\\nattacks must be severe or very  severe with unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or\\ntemporal pain lasting  15 to 180 minutes.  Additionally , there must be a sense\\nof restlessness or agitation and/or at least one of the following  occurring  on\\nthe same side of the body  as the headache: conjunctival injection; lacrimation;\\nnasal cong estion or rhinorrhea; eyelid edema; forehead and facial sweating ;\\nmiosis; or ptosis.  Finally , the headaches must occur with a frequency  between\\none every  other day  and eig ht per day .\\nWith regard to any headaches,  primary  headache disorders are diagnosed only\\nafter excluding  alternative causes of the symptoms.  The Ruling  notes that this\\nprocess may be aided by the sufferer’s keeping  of a “headache journal”\\ndetailing  relevant information about the headaches.  Imaging tests may be\\nused to rule out possible caus ative factors.  Secondary  headaches, which are\\nsymptoms of another condition, are not themselves  medically determinable\\nimpairments.  Imaging tests may be used to rule out possible causative\\nfactors.     \\n4.In accordance with SSR 19-4p, the ALJ was required to consider the impact\\nof the claimant’s photophobia on his/her ability  to work, which impacts the\\nclaimant’s ability  to sustain attention and concentration.\\n156\\nApplicable law.  SSR 19-4p provides that the effects of a claimant’s\\nheadaches must be assessed as with other impairments.  Concerning  RFC\\nassessment, the Ruling  provides the example that “symptoms a primary\\nheadache disorder, such as photophobia, may cause a person to have difficulty\\nsustaining  attention and concentration.”\\n5.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 19-4p in not considering  the claimant’s\\nheadache journal which supports his/her testimony  regarding  the severity  of\\nheadaches.\\n  6.The ALJ’s focus on the lack of a headache journal as a reason for rejectin g the\\nseverity  of the claimant’s headaches does not comply  with SSR 19-4p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 19-4p notes that primary  headache disorders are\\ndiagnosed only after excluding  alternative causes of the symptoms.  The\\nRuling  notes that this process may be aided by the sufferer’s keeping of a\\n“headache journal” detailing  relevan t information about the headaches. The\\nRuling  notes that while a headache journal may help with diagnosis, such\\nevidence is not required “in order to establish an MDI  of a headache disorder.\\n. . . We will, however, consi der evidence from a person’s “headache journal\\nwhen it is part of the recor d, either as part of the treatment notes or as separate\\nevidence, along  with all evidence in the record.”\\n7.The ALJ’s focus on the absence of imag ing tests in evaluating  the severity   of\\nthe claimant’s headaches is not consistent with SSR 19-4p.  \\nApplicable law:  SSR 19-4p explains that imag ing tests may be useful with\\ndiagnosis as the tests may help with ruling out other possible causes of\\nheadache symptoms.  However, the Ruling  explicitly  states that such testing\\n“is not required for a primary  headache disorder diag nosis.”\\n8.The ALJ was required to consider whether the claimant’s headaches were\\nmedically  equal to a listed impairment, as set forth in SSR 19-4p.\\nApplicable law. While there is no listed impairment cover primary  headache\\ndisorders,  SSR 19-4p notes that Listing  11.02, for epilepsy , “is the most\\nclosely  analog ous listed impairment for an MDI  of a primary  head ache\\ndisorder.”  Althoug h not comm on, “a person with a primary  headache\\ndisorder may exhibit equivalent signs and limitati ons to those detailed in\\nlisting 11.02 (parag raph B or D for dyscog nitive seizures), and we may find\\nthat his or her MDI (s) medically  equals the listing .”  For such uncommon\\ncases, the Ruling  should be consulted for its detailed discussion of how it can\\nbe established that L isting  11.02 has been equaled. \\n 9.The ALJ did not evaluate the child claimant’s headaches in accor dance with\\nSSR 19-4p, as required. \\n157\\nApplicable law.  SSR 19-4p explains that while it is phrased in terms on\\ninitial adult claims, its policy interpretations also apply  to claims of minors ,\\ncontinuing  disability  reviews of children and adults, and redeterminations\\nmade when a child receiving  payments turns 18.  SSR 19-4p also notes that in\\nchildren  migraine attacks may last 2-72 hours rather than the 4-72 hour period\\nlisted for adults.  \\nG.    INTERSTITIAL CYST ITIS (IC) (SSR 15-1p)\\n1.The ALJ ignored agency  policy  in evaluating  the claimant’s IC in accordance\\nwith SSR 15-1p which addresses interstitial cy stitis.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 15-1p, which rescinded and replaced SSR 02-2p,\\ndefines I C as:\\n[A] complex , chronic bladder disorder characteriz ed by urinary  frequency ,\\nurinary  urgency, and pelvic pain.  IC occurs most frequently  in women\\n(about 10 times more often than in men), and somet imes prior to age 18. \\nIC may be associated with other disorders, such as fibromy algia, chronic\\nfatig ue syndrome, allerg ies, irritable bowe l syndrome, inflammatory\\nbowel disease, endometriosis, and vulvod ynia (vulvar/vag inal pain).  IC\\nalso may  be associated with sy stemic lupus ery thematosus.\\nThe symptoms of IC may vary in incidence, duration, and severity .  The\\ncauses of IC are currently  unknown, and treatments are directed towards\\nrelief of symptoms.  While no treatment is uniformly  effective for\\nevery one, there are many treatments available, and individuals may obtain\\nsome measure of relief.  However, response to treatment is variable, and\\nsome individuals may have symptoms that are intractable to the current\\ntreatments available.  Treatment may include bladder distention; bladder\\ninstillation; oral drug s, such as the prescription drug  Elmiron,\\nantidepressants, antihistamines, and narcotic analg esics; and the use of\\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. \\n2.The ALJ erred by not giving  proper credit to the claimant’s pain related to\\ninterstitial cystitis that resulted in exertional limits on the claimant’s ability  to\\nstand and walk.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 15-1p provides:\\nIC can cause limitation of function.  The functions likely  to be limited\\ndepend on many  factors, including  urinary frequency  and pain.  An\\nindividual may have limitations in any of the exertional functions such as\\nsitting , standing , walking , lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pulling .  It also\\nmay affect ability  to do postural functions, such as climbing , balancing ,\\nstooping , and crouching .  The ability  to tolerate extreme heat, humidity , or\\nhazards also may  be affected.\\n158\\n3.The ALJ did not adequately  evaluate the claimant’s medically determinable\\nimpairment of IC as it related to and supported a mental impairment as\\nprovided for in SSR 15-1p.\\nApplicable law:  A claiman t with IC may share mental impairment symptoms\\nas ex plained in SSR 15-1p:\\nAn individual with IC also may report symptoms suggestive of a mental\\nimpairment (for example, the individual may say that he or she is anxious\\nor depressed, having  difficulties with memory  and concentration, etc.).  If\\nthe evidence supports a possible discrete mental impairment or symptoms\\nsuch as anxiety or depression resulting from the individual’s IC or the side\\neffects of medication,  we will develop the possible mental impairment.  If\\nthe evidence does not establish a medically  determinable mental\\nimpairment but does establish the presence of symptoms such as anxiety\\nor depression resulting  from the individual’s IC or side effects of\\nmedication, we will determine whether there are any work-related\\nfunctional limitations resulting  from the symptoms.  We will address any\\nwork - related functional limitations at steps 4 and 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process.\\nH.  MENTAL IMPAIRM ENTS\\n1.The ALJ erred in not evaluating  the claimant’s mental impairment and\\nresulting  functional limitations as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1 520a,\\n416.920a.\\n2.The ALJ erred in evaluating  the severity  of the claimant’s mental impairment\\nand associated functional limitations.\\nApplic able law:  When there is evidence of a mental impairment that\\nalleg edly prevents a claimant from working , the ALJ must follow the\\nprocedure for evaluating  mental impairments set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520 a, 416.920a.  In evaluating  the severity  of mental impairments, SSA\\n“must follow a special technique at each level in the administrative review\\nprocess” which helps to:\\na.Identify  the need for additional evidence to determine impairment\\nseverity ;\\nb.Consider and evaluate functional consequences of the mental\\ndisorder(s) relevant to y our ability  to work; and\\nc.Organize and present our findings in a clear, concise, and consistent\\nmanner.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(a), 416.920a(a).  SSA requires rating  the degree of\\nfunctional loss resulting  from the mental impairment in four areas:  (1)\\nunderstand, remember, or apply information; (2) inter act with others; (3)\\n159\\nconcentrate, persist, or maintain pace; and (4) adapt or manag e oneself.  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(c)(3), 416.920a(c)(3).\\nThese areas are rated on a scale that ranges from no limitation to a level of\\nseverity  which is “incompatible with the ability  to do any gainful activ ity”\\nusing  a SSA uses a five-point  scale: none, mild, moderate, marked, and\\nextreme.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(c )(4), 416.920a(c)(4). SSA uses these four\\ncriteria to determine whether a claimant suffers from a “severe” mental\\nimpairment and whether the claimant meets or equals a listed mental disorder. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(d)(1) and (d)(2), 416.920a(d)(1), and (d)(2).41  While\\nthe ALJ is no longer required to complete the PRTF, s/he instead, must\\n“document application of the technique in the decision.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520a(e)(2), 416.920a(e)(2).  The reg ulations provide:\\nAt the administrative law judge hearing  and Appeals Council levels, the\\nwritten decision issued by the administrative law judge or Appeals\\nCouncil must incorporate the pertinent finding s and conclusions based on\\nthe technique. The decision must show the significant history , including\\nexamination and laboratory  finding s, and the functional limitations that\\nwere considered in reaching  a conclusion about the severity  of the menta l\\nimpairmen t(s). The decision must include a specific finding  as to the\\ndegree of limitation in each of the functional areas described in parag raph\\n(c) of this section.\\nHAL LEX I-3-7-14(I ) states that the Appe als Council “will grant review and\\nmay remand a case if the ALJ did not properly  evaluate the claimant’s mental\\nimpairment(s) under 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and 416.920a, despite the clear\\npresence of a medically  determinable mental impairment.”\\n3.Remand is warranted given the ALJ’s contradictory  finding s regarding  the\\nseverity  of the claimant’s mental impairment(s).\\nAppl icable law:  An ALJ who finds that the claimant has a severe mental\\nimpairment, but, at the same time, concludes that the claimant’s mental\\nimpairment results in mild or no restriction in the ability  to understand,\\nremember or apply  information; (2) interact with others; (3) concentrate,\\npersist, or maintain pace; and (4) adapt or manag e oneself activities of daily\\nliving , makes internally  contradictory  finding s. The regulations provide that if\\nthe degree of limitation is rated “none” or “mild, “we will generally  conclude\\n41 After evaluating the above categories, the ALJ is required to determine whether a claimant suffers from\\na “severe” mental impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a , 416.920a .  If the degree of limitation is rated “none”\\nor “mild, “we will generally conclude that your impairment is not sever e, unless the evidence otherwise\\nindicates that there is more than a minimal limitation the claimant’s ability to do basic work activities.”  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a (d)(1), 416.920a (d)(1).  If the mental impairment is severe, the next step is to determine\\nif it meets or equals a listed mental disorder.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a (d)(2), 416.920a (d)(2). If the\\nimpairment is not of listing severity, the third step is to determine the claimant’s RFC.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520a (d)(3), 416.920a (d)(3).\\n160\\nthat your impairment is not severe.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(d)(1 ),\\n416.920a(d)(1).\\n4.The ALJ did not properly  explain the extent or scope of limitations recog nized\\nby the finding  of moderate limitations in the ability  to concentrate, persist, or\\nmaintain pace.\\nApplicable law :  “Concentrate, persist, and maintain pace” refers to:\\nthe abilities to focus attention on work activities and stay on task at a\\nsustained rate.  Examples includ e: Initiating  and performing  a task that\\nyou understand and know how to do; working  at an appropriate and\\nconsistent pace; completing  tasks in a timely  manner; ignoring  or avoiding\\ndistractions while working ; chang ing activities or work setting s without\\nbeing  disruptive; working  close to or with others without interrupting  or\\ndistracting  them; sustaining  an ordinary  routine and regular attendance  at\\nwork; and work ing a full day without needing  more than the allotted\\nnumber or length of rest periods during  the day.  These examples illustrate\\nthe nature of this area of mental functioning.  We do not require\\ndocumentation of all of the ex amples.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 12.00(e)(3).\\n5.Despite finding  that the claimant has severe mental impairments  resulting  in\\nmoderate difficulties in interacting  with others, the ALJ erred in not\\nincorporating  any social limitations into the RF C assessment.\\nApplicable law :  “Interact with others” refers to: \\nthe abilities to relate to and work with supervisors, co-workers, and the\\npublic.  Examples include: cooperating  with others; asking  for help when\\nneeded; handling  conflicts with others; stating  own point of view;\\ninitiating  or sustaining  conversation; understanding  and respond ing to\\nsocial cues (phy sical, verbal, emotional); responding  to requests, suggests,\\ncriticism, correction, and challeng es; keeping  social interactions free of\\nexcessive irritability , sensitivity , argumentativeness, or suspiciousness.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, § 12.00(E)(2)\\n6.Given the [State agency ’s/AL J’s] non-compliance with 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1503(e), 416.903(e), the Appeals Council should remand this case with\\ninstructions to [obtain a mental health evaluation in light of evidence\\nindicating  the existence of a mental impairment or obtain the assistance of a\\nqualified psy cholog ist or psy chiatrist.]\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1503(e), 416.903(e) require s the State\\nagency  to have a psycholog ist or psychiatrist review a file when there is\\n161\\nevidence of the existence of a mental impairment.  See also 20 C.F.R. §\\n416.903(e). This regulation, which tracks the provisions of the Social Security\\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 421(h), provides:\\nAn initial determination by a State agency  or the Social Securit y\\nAdministration that you are not disabled (or a Social Security\\nAdmi nistration review of a State agency ’s initial determination), in any\\ncase where there is evidence which indicates the existence of a mental\\nimpairment, will be made only after every  reasonable effort has been\\nmade to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psycholog ist has completed\\nthe medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual\\nfunctional capacity  assessmen t.  (See § 404.1616 the qualifications we\\nconsider necessary  for a psycholog ist to be a psycholog ical consultant and\\n§ 404.1617 for what we consider “reasonable effort”).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1503(e), 416.903(e).  There is some indication the\\nprovisions are relevant to the ALJ level. The statute refers to “[a]n initial\\ndetermination under subsection (a), (c), (g ), or (i) of this section[ ,]”  42 U.S.C.\\n§ 421(h), and subsection (c) of the section  pertains to the review of\\ndeterminations.\\n7.The AL J committed reversible error in rely ing on GAF  scores.\\n8.The AL J erred in equating  the GAF  scores to specific functional limitations.\\nApplicable law.  In the Fifth Editi on of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\nof Mental Disorders (“DSM-5”) (2013), “[i]t was recommended that the GAF\\nbe dropped from DSM-5 for several reasons, includ ing its conceptual lack of\\nclarity  (i.e., including  symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in its\\ndescriptors) and questionable psychometrics in routine practice.” DSM-5 at\\n16.  However, some treatmen t records will still contain GAF  scores, which the\\nALJ is required to evaluate as opinion evidence. SSA Administrative Messag e\\nAM-13066, effective J uly 22, 2013,42 states:\\nAs with other opinion evidence, the extent to which an adjudicator can\\nrely on the GAF rating  as a measure of impairment severity  and mental\\nfunctioning  depends on whether the GAF rating is consistent with other\\nevidence,  how familiar the rater is with the claimant, and the rater’s\\nexpertise.\\nHowever, the GAF  score is “never dispositive of impairment severity ” and a\\nparticular GAF  score should not be equated with a listing -level limiter  or a\\nparticular mental residual functional capacity  assessment.  Id.\\nThe Federal Register provides a historical explanation as to why the\\nCommissioner did not include GAF  rating s in the introductory  parag raphs of\\n42 A copy of this Memorandum  is in Part II, Document #6, infra at pages 283- 90.\\n162\\nthe revised and final mental listing s in 12.00D (56 F ed.

OBESITY (SSR 19-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not properly  apply  SSR 19-2p in evaluating  the severit y and\\nfunctional limitations of the claimant’s extreme obesi ty, as indicated by\\nhis/her weig ht of *** pounds.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  19-2p, effective May 20, 2019,\\nprovides that practitioners diagnose obesity , characteriz ed by excessive body\\nfat, on the basis of “a person’s medical history , physical examinations, and\\nbody  mass index  (BMI).”  However, the condition “is defined  as a BMI of\\n30.0 or higher.”  In addition, practitioners may diagnose obesity , even where\\nBMI is in the normal range, based on waist measurement.  The Ruling\\nrecog nizes that people who store fat in this area may have an increased risk of\\nobesity -related complication s, a risk that increases with a waist size greater\\nthan 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men.  \\nSSR 19-2p clarifies that a diagnosis of obesity  is not used to establish obesity\\nas an MDI .  Rather, finding s from an acceptable medical source “that may\\nestablish an [medically  determinable impairment]  of obesity  include measured\\nheight and weight, measured waist size, and BMI measurements over time.” \\nAlthoug h obesity  can be defined by BMI, the Ruling  acknowledg es that a\\nclaimant “who has a BMI of 30 or above may not have an MDI  of obesity  if a\\nlarge percentag e of the person’s weig ht is from muscle.”  However, the\\nadmini stration is not willing  to purchase tests to measure a claimant’s body\\nfat.  \\nSSR 19-2p explains when obesity  is considered a severe impairment.  The\\nseverity  of obesity  is determined not by the claimant’s particular weig ht or\\nBMI, but by the totality  of evidence including  all symptoms and funct ional\\nlimitations.  The Ruling  also notes that terms used by medical sources\\nseeming ly denotative of severity , like “severe,” “extreme,” or “morbid,” do\\nnot show that obesity  is a severe impairment.    \\n2.The ALJ failed to adequately evaluate the functional impact of the claimant’s\\nsevere medically  determinable impairment of obesiy  on his/her RFC as\\nrequired by  SSR 19-2p.\\n163\\nApplicable law:  When obesity  is a severe impairment, the assessed RFC\\nmust include corresponding  obesity -related limitations.  According  to SSR 19-\\n2p, since obesity increases stress on weig ht-bearing  joints, it may contribute\\nto range of motion limitations of both the skeletal spine and extremities. \\nAddition ally, it may cause manipulative limitations due to fatty  tissue in the\\nhands and fingers; an inability  to tolerate extreme heat, humidity , or hazards;\\nor limitations  in the physical or mental ability  to sustain work activity .  When\\nassessing  RFC, an adjudicator should also consider that the effects of obesity\\ncombined with other impairments may be greater than their individual effects.\\n3.The ALJ erred by not considering  whether the claimant’s obesity  equa ls a\\nlisting  given the claimant’s difficulty  ambulating  without an assistive device\\n[or due to other impairments] .\\nApplicable law: The regulations provide that a claimant is eligible for\\nbenefits if his/her impai rments, or combination of impairments, meets or\\nequals an impairment found in the Listing  of Impairments. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520( d), 416.920(d); 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.  Medical\\nequivalence will be found when the impairment “at least equal in severity  and\\nduration to the criteria of any listed impairment.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15 26(a),\\n416.926(a).43  SSR 02-1p (before May  20, 2019) discussed when obesity  may\\nbe medically  equivalent to a listed impairment:\\nWe may also find that obesity , by itself, is medically  equivalent to a listed\\nimpairment . . . .  For example, if the obesity  is of such a level that it\\nresults in an inability  to ambulate effectively , as defined in sections\\n1.00(B )(2)(b) or 101.00(B )(2)(b) of the listing s, it may substitute for the\\nmajor dysfunction of a joint(s) due to any cause (and its associated\\ncriteria), with the invo lvement of one major peripheral weig ht-bearing\\njoint in listing s 1.02A or 101.02A, and we will then make a finding  of\\nmedical equivalence.\\nId. SSR 19-2p, which rescinded and replaced SSR 02-1p effective May  20,\\n2019, notes that while obesity  is not a listed impairment, the functiona l\\nlimitations it causes may medically  equal a listing .  This may occur with\\nobesity  alone or in combination with other impairments, based on the\\nparticular information in the record.  Id.\\n“Inability  to ambulate effectively ” is defined by  regulation as:\\nInability  to ambulate effectively  means an extreme limitation of , the\\nability  to walk; i.e., an impairment(s) that interferes very seriously  with\\nthe individual’s ability  to independentl y initiate, sustain, or complete\\nactivities. Ineffective ambulation is defined generall y as having\\ninsufficient lower extremity  function . . . to permit independent\\nambulation without the use of a hand-held assistive device(s) that limits\\n43 See page 130, supra for a discussion of medical equivalence in adults and chi ldren.\\n164\\nthe functioning  of both upper ex tremities . . . .\\nTo ambulate effectively , individuals must be capable of sustaining  a\\nreasonable walking  pace  over a sufficient distance to be able to carry  out\\nactivities of daily  living.   They  must have the ability  to travel without\\ncompanion assistance to and from a place of employment or school. \\nTherefore, examples of ineffective ambulation include, but are not limit ed\\nto, the inability to walk without the use of a walker, two crutches or two\\ncanes, the inability to walk a block at a reasonable pace on rough or\\nuneven surfaces, the inability to use standard public transportation, the\\ninability to carry out routine ambulatory activities, such as shopping and\\nbanking, and the inability to climb a few steps at a reasonable pace with\\nthe use of a single hand rail. The ability  to walk independently  about\\none’s home without the use of assistive devices does not, in and of itself,\\nconstitute effective ambulation.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(B )(2)(b) (Emphasis added).\\n4.The ALJ did not consider the impact of the claimant’ s obesity  on his/her\\ndiabetes mellitus on his/her ability to work as required by SSR 14-2p which\\naddresses the interaction between DM and obesity .\\nApplicab le law:  SSR 14-2p recog nizes that “a person with DM and obesity\\nmay have more severe complications than the effects of each of the\\nimpairments considered separately .”  More generally , SSR 14-1p state s that\\n“[t]he combined effects of DM and another impairment(s) can be greater than\\nthe effects of each of the impairments considered separately .”\\nJ. REFLEX SYM PATHETIC DYST ROPHY (RSD) (SSR 03-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 03-2p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s RSD.\\nApplicable law: SSR 03-2p pertains to evaluating  “cases involving  reflex\\nsympathetic dystrophy /complex regional pain syndrome.” SSR 03-2p\\nspeci fically  notes that this impairment can be established in the presence of\\n“persistent complaints of pain that are typically  out of prop ortion to the\\nseverity  of any documented precipitant”  as well as one or more of the\\nfollowing  clinically  documented signs in the affected region at any time:  (1)\\nswelling ; (2) autonomic instability --seen as chang es in skin color or texture,\\nchang es in sweating (decreased or excessive sweating ), chang es in skin\\ntemperature, and abnormal pilomotor erection (gooseflesh); (3) abnormal hair\\nor nail growt h (growth can be either too slow or too fast); (4) osteoporosis; or\\n(5) involuntary  movements of the affected reg ion of the initial injury .\\nThe Ruling  also states that “pain is an expected symptom of this disorder,”\\nand that other sympto ms, such as “extreme sensitivity  to touch or pressure, or\\n165\\nabnormal sensations of heat or cold, can also be associated with this disorder.” \\nId.  This Ruling  recog nizes that persistent clinical prog ression resulting  in\\nmuscle atrophy , despite appropriate diagnosis and treatment, “hallmark a poor\\nprog nosis.”  Id. SSR 03-2p also recog nizes that “[o]pinions from an\\nindividual’s medical sources, especially  treating  sources, concerning  the\\neffect(s) of RSDS/CRPS on the individual’s ability  to function in a sustained\\nmanner in performing  work activities, or in performing  activities of daily\\nliving , are important in enabling  adjudicators to draw conclusions about the\\nseverity of the impairment(s) and the individual’s RFC.”  Id.  Moreover, SSR\\n03-2p provides that the chronic pain and medications prescribed to treat\\nchronic pain may impact a claimant’s ability  to maintain attention and\\nconcentration and the importance of a treating  physician’s opinion  in\\nevaluating  this impairment.\\nSSR 03-2p specifically  addresses the evaluation of younger individuals with\\nRSD, stating  that:\\na finding  of “disabled” is not precluded for those individuals under age 50\\nwho do not meet all of the criteria of a speci fic rule and who do not have\\nthe ability  to perform a full range of sedentary  work.  The conclusion\\nabout whether such individuals are disabled will depend primarily  on the\\nnature and ex tent of their functional limitations or restrictions.\\n2.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 03-2p in not addressing  the impact of the\\nmedications the claimant takes for his/her chronic pain.\\nApplicable law:  Social Secu rity Ruling  03-2p specifically  addresses chronic\\npain, stating :\\nChronic pain and many  of the medications prescribed to treat it may affect\\nan individual’s ability to maintain attention and concentration, as well as\\nadversel y affect his or her cognition, mood, and behavior, and may even\\nreduce motor reaction times.  These factors can interfere with an\\nindiv idual’s ability  to sustain work activity  over time, or preclude\\nsustained work activity  altog ether.  When evaluating  durati on and\\nseverity , as well as when evaluating  RFC, the effects of chronic pain and\\nthe use of pain medications must be carefully  considered.\\nK.SICK LE CELL DISE ASE  (SCD) (SSR 17-3p)\\n1.The ALJ erred by ignoring  the SSR 17-3p requirements for properly\\nevaluating  the claimant’s sickle cell disease.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-3p acknowledg es that sickle cell disease (“SCD”)\\n“is not alway s easy to evaluate due to its varying nature and complications.” \\nThe Ruling  explain s that the inherited disease, which affects the hemog lobin\\nwithin red blood cells, causes blockag es that slow or stop the flow of blood\\n166\\nand oxygen.  People with the disease “are predisposed to pain, infection, and\\nother complications.”  Id. Laboratory  blood tests establish both the existence\\nand variants of SCD.  The Ruling  notes that HbSS is the most common and,\\nusually , most severe  form, whereas sickle cell trait alone is not an impairment\\nunless it results in complications.\\nThe Ruling  recognizes that a common complication of SCD is pain crisis,\\nwhich can be acute or chronic.  Acute pain crises can be intense and “strike\\nalmost anywhere in the body  and in more  than one spot at a time.”  Id.  “It\\nusually  occurs when lack of oxygen to the bone due to vaso-occlusion results\\nin the death of bone tissue (avascular necrosis) at various joints such as the\\nhips, shoulders and ankles.”  Id.  Other complications can include anemia\\ncausing  organ or nerve damag e with symptoms such as fatigue, weak ness,\\nshortness of breath, and dizziness.  Additionally , SCD sufferers can\\nexperience pulmonary  complications, severe bacterial infections, mental\\ndisorders, strokes, and silent strokes.\\nUnless the claimant’s SCD, alone or in combination with other impai rments,\\nmeets or equals the criteria of a listing , the RFC assessment must proceed\\nwith consideratio n of the effects of SCD such as “pain, fatigue, and shortness\\nof breath that may affect [the claima nt’s] ability  to stand and walk.  In\\naddition, a person experiencing  repeated acute pain crises may have difficulty\\nmaintaining  concentration to complete tasks and have frequent absences from\\nwork.”  Id.\\nL.  VISUAL  IMPAIRM ENTS (SSR 85-15)\\n1.The ALJ should have obtain ed vocational expert testimony  considering  the\\nclaimant’s visual impairment resulting  in non-ex ertional limitations.44\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 96-9p, since “[ m]ost sedentar y unskilled\\noccupations require working  with small objects,” if:\\na visual limitation prevents an individual from seeing  the small objects\\ninvolved in most sedentary  unskilled work, or if an individual is not able\\nto avoid ordinary  hazards in the workplace, such as boxes on the floor,\\n44 Note: The ALJ is not required to do so, unless in the Third or Eighth Circuit, or if only non-exertional\\nlimitations are involved.  HAL LEX I-2-5-50(B)  states that  when directed by the Appe als Council or a court\\nor if an Ac quiescence Ruling (AR), such as one of the following, requires VE e vidence: \\nThird Circuit (Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania): AR 01-1(3): Sykes v.

These cases may require the\\nuse of vocational resources.\\n2.The ALJ erred by not comply ing with SSR 83-14 and SSR 85-15 concerning\\nthe limitations resulting  from the claimant’s visual impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR  83-14 provides that a claimant’s remaining\\noccupational base will be significantly  diminished for both light and medium\\nwork where the claimant has –visual impairmen t which, while not of Listing\\nseverity , “causes the person to be a hazard to self and others -- usually  a\\nconstriction of visual fields rather than a loss of acuity  -- the manife stations of\\ntripping  over boxes while walking , inability to detect approaching  persons or\\nobjects, difficulty in walking  up and down stairs, etc.[ .]”  SSR 85-15 also\\nstates that: \\n. . . even if a person’s visual impairment(s) were to eliminate all jobs that\\ninvolve very good vision (such as working  with small objects or reading\\nsmall print), as long  as he or she retains sufficien t visual acuity  to be able\\nto handle and work with rather large objects (and has the visual fields to\\navoid ordinary hazards in a workplace), there would be a substantial\\nnumber of jobs remain ing across all exertional levels.  However, a finding\\nof disability  could be appropriate in the relatively  few instances in whic h\\nthe claim ant’s vocational profile is extremely  adverse, e.g., closely\\napproaching  retirement age, limited education or less,  unskilled or no\\ntransferable skills, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field of\\nwork in which g ood vision is essential.\\nIV. ADM INISTRATIVE PRO CEDURAL ISSUES\\nA. ALJ’S DUT Y TO DEVELOP THE RECORD \\n1.The ALJ did not fulfill his/her duty to develop the claimant’s complete\\nmedical history  as required by the Social Security  Act, regulations, and SSR\\n17-4p.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 17-4p acknowledg es that by  statute SSA: \\nshall consider all evidence available in [an] individual’s case record, and\\nshall develop a complete medical history  of at least the prece ding twelve\\nmonths for any case in which a determination is made that the individual\\nis not under a disability .\\nSSR 17-4p (citing  42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(5)(B ), 1382c(a)(3)(H)(i)).  The statute\\nfurther requires SSA to “make every  reasonable effort to obtain from the\\nindividual’s treati ng physician (or other treating  health care provider) all\\n168\\nmedical evidence, including  diagnostic tests, necessary  in order to properly\\nmake such determination, prior to evaluating  medical eviden ce obtained from\\nany other source on a consultative  basis.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(5)(B ),\\n1382c(a)(3)(H)(i).   \\nThe regulations provide that prior to making  a deter mination that a claimant is\\nnot disabled, SSA will develop the claimant’s complete medical history  for at\\nleast the 12 months preceding  the month in which the application is filed\\n“unless there is a reason to believe that development of an earlier period is\\nnecessary  or unless you say that your disabil ity began less than 12 months\\nbefore you filed your application.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(d) and 416.912(d).\\nFurther, SSA will make “every  reasonable effort to help [the claimant]  get\\nmedical reports from your own medical sources when you give us permission\\nto request the reports.”  Id.   \\nSSR 17-4p defines “every  reasonable effort” to mean that SSA “will make an\\ninitial request for evidence from the medical source or entity  that maintains\\nthe medical evidence, and, at any time between 10 and 20 calendar days after\\nthe initial request, if the eviden ce has not been received,” a follow-up request\\nwill be make “to obtain the medical evidence necessary  to make a\\ndetermination.”  Id.45  \\n2.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the claimant, throu gh his/her representative,\\nto ask witnesses [the VE, the ME, the lay witnesses, etc.] questions material to\\nthe issues.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations unequivocally  provide that at the hearing\\nthe ALJ “may ask the witness any questions material to the issues and will\\nallow the parties or their designated representatives to do so.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.950(e), 416.1450(e) (emphasis added). Permitting  the parties to do so is\\nthus not a matter of discretion. \\n3. The ALJ erred in not ordering  a consultative examination in this case due to\\nthe paucity  of available evidence.   \\n4.As the ALJ rejected all medical opinions of record, the ALJ implicitly  foun d\\nthat the evidence was insufficient and should have further devel oped the\\nrecord by  obtaining  a consultative ex amination.    \\n45 SSR 17-4p states that the agency’s responsibilities do not “reduce the claimant’s responsibilities in any\\nway.”  While SSA has a duty to develop the record, claimants and their representatives have the primary\\nresponsibility to provide suppor ting evidence and are expected “to make good faith efforts to ensure that”\\nSSA receives all evidence known to the claimant that relates to disability or blindne ss.  The claimant or\\nrepresentative will be asked to submit evidence, but “if the individual or representative shows that he or she\\nis unable to obtain the evidence despite good faith efforts or for reasons beyond his or her control,” SSA “may\\nrequest the evidence directly from the medical source or entity that maintains the evidence.”\\n169\\n5.The ALJ erred in not recontacting  the claimant’s treating  medical provider\\ngiven the ALJ’s finding  that the evidence from this provider was insufficient\\nand or inconsistent. \\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court of the United States stated in Sims v.\\nApfel , 530 U.S. 103, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 2085, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000) that “Social\\nSecurity  proceeding s are inquisitorial rather than adversarial” and that the\\nALJ has the duty “to investig ate the facts and develop the arguments both for\\nand against granting  benefits.”  Id. (citing  Richardson v. Perales , 402 U.S.\\n389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).  See also HALLEX I-2-6-56,\\nAdducing  the Evidence) (states that an “ALJ has a duty to ensure that the\\nadministrative record is fully  and fairly  developed”).\\nThe reg ulations provide for ordering  consultative ex aminations:\\nWe may ask you to attend one or more consultative examinations at our\\nexpense.  See §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t for the rules governing the\\nconsultative examination process. Generally , we will not request a\\nconsultative examination until we have made every reasonable effort to\\nobtain evidence from your own medical sources.  However, in some\\ninstances, such as when a source is known  to be unable to provide certain\\ntests or procedures or is known to be nonproductive or uncooperative, we\\nmay order a consultative examinati on while awaiting  receipt of medical\\nsource evidence. We will not evaluate this evidence until we have made\\nevery  reasonable effort to obtain evidence from y our medical sources.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(b)(2), 416.912(b)(2).\\nIn some cases, SSA may not be able to make a “determination or decision\\nbecause the evidence” is “insufficient or inconsistent.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b), 416.9 20b(b).  Evidence is considered to be insufficient “when\\nit does not contain all the information we need to make our determination or\\ndecision” and evidence is inconsistent “when it conflicts with other evidence,\\ncontains an internal conflict, is ambig uous, or when the medical evidence\\ndoes not appear to be based on medically acceptable clinical or laboratory\\ndiagnostic techniques .  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b), 416.920b(b).  In such\\ncases, SSA “may  need to take the additional actions” as set forth in\\n“parag raphs (b)(1) throug h (4) of this section.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b),\\n416.920b(b).  \\nIn cases where the evidence in the case record as well as “any  medical\\nopinion(s ) and prior administrative medical finding s,” is inconsistent, SSA\\n“will consider the relevant eviden ce and see if we can determine whether you\\nare disabled based on the evidence we have.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b)(1),\\n416.920b(b)(1).  In cases where the evidence in the case record is consistent\\n“but we have insufficient evidence to determine whether you are disabled, or\\nif after considering  the evidence we determine we cannot reach a conclusion\\n170\\nabout whether you are disabled,” SSA “will determine the best way to resolve\\nthe inconsistency  or insufficiency  which “depend[ s] on the nature of the\\ninconsistency or insufficiency.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b)(2),\\n416.920b(b)(2).  SSA will “try to resolve the inconsistency  or insufficiency ”\\nby taking  any one or more of the following  actions:  \\n•Recontact the claimant’ s medical source . 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)( 2)(i), 416.920b (b)(2)(i). However, SSA may “choose\\nnot to seek additional evidence or clarifica tion from a medical source\\nif we know from experience that the source either cannot or will not\\nprovide the necessary  evidence.” Id. Also, in cases where the medical\\nevidence is obtained over the telephone, SSA “will send the telephone\\nreport to the source for review, sig nature, and return.” Id. \\n•Request additional existing evidence. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)(2)(ii), 416.920b (b)(2)(ii).\\n•Ask the claimant to undergo a consultative examination “at our\\nexpens e (see §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t).” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)(2)(iii), 416.920b (b)(2)(iii).\\n•Ask the claimant or others for more information . 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b (b)(2)(iv), 416.920b (b)(2)(iv). \\nIn cases where the inconsistencies in the evidence cannot be resolved, or\\nwhere “despite effor ts to obtain additional evidence, the evidence is\\ninsufficient to determine whether you are disabled,” SSA “will make a\\ndetermination or decision based on the evidence we have.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b (b)(3), 416.920b (b)(3).  SSA is not required to “take all of the\\nactions listed” above and will “consider any additiona l evidence we receive\\ntogether with the evidence we already  have.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b (b)(2),\\n416.920b(b)(2).    \\n6.The ALJ erred in not ordering  a psycholog ical examination in this case given\\nthe lack of support for the claimant’s sy mptoms in the record.\\nApplicable law :  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529(b), 416.929(b) provides that:\\n[w]e will develop evidence regarding the possibility  of a medically\\ndeterminable mental impairment when we have information to suggest\\nthat such an impairment exists, and you alleg e pain or other symptoms but\\nthe medical signs and labor atory finding s do not substantiate any physical\\nimpairment(s) capable of producing  the pain or other sy mptoms.\\n7. The ALJ erred by not obtaining the claimant’s prior claim file which was\\nrelevant for the current claim.\\nApplicable law:  SSA is obligated to develop a claimant’s “complete medical\\n171\\nhistory  for at least the 12 months preceding  the month in which you file your\\napplication” unless more historical development is needed.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1512(d), 416.912(d).  A prior claim file may be obtained if the evidence\\ntherein is relevant for the current claim.  See HAL LEX I-2-1-13 addressing\\nwhen a prior claim file is required.\\n8.The ALJ disreg arded his/her duty to develop the record by not issui ng a\\nneeded subpoena.\\n9.The ALJ committed reversible error in not issuing  a subpoena to obtain the\\nrecords of the claimant’s former treating  physician, whose records the\\nclaimant was unable to obtain.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5-78(A) provides that a claimant can request\\nan AL J to issue a subpoena under certain circumstances:\\nWhen it is reasonably  necessary  for the full presentation of a case, an\\nadministr ative law judge (ALJ) may issue a subpoena on his or her own\\ninitiati ve or at the request of a claimant or appointed representative.  See\\n20 C.F.R. 404.950(d) and 416.1450(d).  An ALJ may issue a subpoena for\\nthe appearance and testimony  of a witness(es), and to produce books,\\nrecords, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to\\nan issue at the hearing .  For example, an ALJ may find a subpoena\\nnecessary when a person having  knowledg e of a material fact or\\npossession of documentary  evidence is reluctant or unwilling  to testif y or\\nprovide the evidence.\\nThe claimant seekin g a subpoena must submit a request in writing  at least\\nten days prior to the hearing.  HALLEX I-2-5-78(B )(1) (citing  20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.950(d)(2), 416.1450(d)(2), 405.332).\\nA claimant’s request for a subpoena must:\\n•Give the name(s ) of the witness(es) or document(s) to be\\nproduced;\\n•Describ e the address or location of the witness(es) or document(s)\\nwith sufficient detail to find them;\\n•State the import ant fact(s) that the witness(es) or document(s) is\\nexpected to prove; and\\n•Indicate why the fact(s) could not be proven without issuing  a\\nsubpoena.\\nHAL LEX I -2-5-78(B )(1).\\nThe ALJ will issue a subpoena “[w]hen all other means of obtaining  the\\n172\\ninformation or testimony  have been ex hausted” as set forth below:\\n•The claiman t or ALJ cannot obtain the information or testimony\\nwithout the subpoena; and\\n•The evidence or testimony  is reasonably  necessary for the full\\npresentation of the case.\\nHAL LEX I -2-5-78(B )(2).\\nThe ALJ will deny  the subpoena  request if “the requested information or\\ntestimony  is already  a part of the record.”  HAL LEX I-2-5-78(B )(2).  The\\nALJ may also delay  ruling  on the subpoena until developmen t can be\\ncompleted if “the requested information or testimony  is not part of the record,\\nbut has already been requested or can be developed by hearing  office staff.” \\nAdditionally :\\nIf development is completed and it is clear that the usual procedur es used\\nto obtain the information or testimony  have been unsuccessful, the ALJ\\nwill determine whether issuing  a subpoena for the requested information\\nor testimony  is reasonably  necessary  for a full presentation of the case. \\n[Moreover]  [i]f the claimant is requesting  a subpoena to obtain testimony\\nfrom an author of a written report , the ALJ must carefully  consider\\nwhether a cross-ex amination is required for a full presentation of the case.\\nId.  A subpoena can also be issued on the ALJ’s initiative “when an individual\\nhas information or can offer testimony  that the ALJ determines is reasonably\\nnecessary  for the full present ation of the case and all other means of obtaining\\nthis infor mation or testimony  have been exhausted.”  However, while ME, VE\\nand consultative examiners who will not appear voluntarily  may also be\\nsubpoenaed to appea r under the same standard applicable to other witnesses,\\n“an ALJ will usually  attempt to obtain testimony  from these  individuals via\\nvideo teleconferencing  or by  telephone.”\\nIf the ALJ denies the claimant’s request for a subpoena, “the ALJ must notify\\nthe claimant of the denial, either in writing  or on the record at the hearing ”\\nand must “enter the request into the record as an exhibit.” HAL LEX I-2-5-\\n78(D).  In those cases where the denial is in writing , “the ALJ will also enter\\nthe denial notice into the record as an exhibit.” The ALJ must “explain why\\nthe AL J declined to issue a subpoena.”\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-82  states that “[i]f an individual refuses or fails to comply\\nwith a subpoena, the administrativ e law judge (ALJ) will consider any chang e\\nin circumstance since issuing  the subpoena and re-evaluate whether the\\neviden ce or facts requested are reasonably  necessary  for the full presentation\\nof the case.”  In such cases, the ALJ “will prepare a memorandum to the\\n[OGC]  Regional Chief  Counsel requesting  enforcement of the subpoena.” \\n173\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-82 addresses contempt proceeding s and states that “[i]f OGC\\nobtains an order from the court , the failure of any subpoenaed individual to\\nappear as a witness at a hearing  or provide requested documents or facts may\\nresult in contempt proceeding s.”\\n10.The ALJ did not comply  with the duty to develop the record as to the\\nclaimant’s mental RF C.\\nApplicable  law:  SSR 85-16 observes that the reports of treating  sources may\\ndisclose other, previously  unreported sources of medical evidence. Such\\nsources are to be contacted given the need for the medical documentation to\\nreflect all available sources, particularly  where the severity of a mental\\nimpairment is questi onable or the RFC inconclusive.  An adjudicator should\\nrecontact sources whose notes or reports are incomplete, and every  reasona ble\\neffort should be made to obtain all necessary  medical evidence from the\\ntreating  sources bearing  on severity  and RFC before consultative evidence is\\nobtained  from any other source.  It is where treating  sources cannot provide\\nessential information that consultative examinations may resolve the\\nimpairment or RF C issue.\\n11.The ALJ erred in failing  to address the claimant’s pre-hearing  requests for a\\nsubpoena [or any  other requests]  as required by  HAL LEX I -2-6-52(E).\\nApplicable law:  The ALJ is required to “rule on-the-record regarding  any\\npre-hearing  requests or motions of the claimant or representative, i.e., requests\\nfor postponement (20 CFR 404.936 and 416.1436), disqualification of the\\nALJ (20 CFR 404.940 and 416.1440) and subpoenas (20 CFR 404.950( d) and\\n416.1450(d)).” HAL LEX I -2-6-52(E).\\n12.The ALJ did not fairly  and fully  develop the record in not referencing  the\\npost-hearing  evidence in the decis ion and in dismissing  the claimant’s\\nexplanation for why the new evidence was not submitted within the timeframe\\ninitially  specified at the hearing .\\n13.The ALJ erred in failing to even mention medical evidence submitted post-\\nhearing  but before the decision was issued.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§  404.935(b), 416.1536(b) provides that if the\\nclaimant has evidence but has missed the deadline for submissio n, the ALJ\\n“will accept the evidence if he or she has not yet issued a decision and you did\\nnot inform us about or submit the evidence before the deadline . . . .”  While\\nthe ALJ can provide reasons for not accepting  the evidence, remand  is\\nrequired if the AL J fails to address the evidence at all.  Id.     \\nHAL LEX I -2-6-78 addresses closing  the hearing  and states in part:\\nBefore closing  the hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) will\\n174\\nremind the claimant that he or she must inform the ALJ about or submit\\nall evidence known to him or her that relates to whether he or she is blind\\nor disabled.  See 20 C.F .R. 404.1512 and 416.912.\\nIf there is no additional evidence, “the ALJ will state on the record that the\\nhearing  and record are closed.”  Id.  However,\\nIf the claimant or representative has additional evidence to submit, the\\nALJ will consider whether to grant an extension of time to submit the\\nevidence using  the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation Law\\n(HAL LEX) manual I-2-7-20 A. When the ALJ determines that additional\\nevidence is needed (for example, a consultative examination or an updated\\nmedical report), the ALJ will inform the claim ant and representative (if\\nany) that the record will remain open after the hearing  to allow time to\\nsubmit or obtain the additional evidence. If the claimant and\\nrepresentative intend to submit  additional evidence, the ALJ will decide\\nhow long to leave the record open. If the ALJ intends to obtain additional\\nevidence, the ALJ will advise the claimant and the representative that,\\nbefore the ALJ issues a decision, the ALJ will give them an opportunity  to\\nexamine the evidence, provide comments,  object to the evidence, refute\\nthe evidence by submitting  other evidence, or request a supplemental\\nhearing , if necessary . For specific proffer instructions, see HAL LEX I-2-\\n7-1. The claimant or representative may knowing ly and voluntarily  waive\\nthe right to examine the evidence. If they knowing ly and voluntarily  waive\\nthis rig ht, the AL J will indicate such waiver on the record.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-20(B ) provides that while an ALJ may generally  decline to\\nconsider or obtain evidence that a claimant did not inform the SSA about or\\nsubmit at least five business days before the scheduled hearing , “[w]hen a\\nclaimant or appointed representative misses the five-day  deadline and requests\\nadditional time to submit evidence after the hearing , the ALJ generally  will\\nevaluate whether the circumstances in 20 C.F.R. 404.935(b) and 416.1435(b)\\napply  using  the procedures in HAL LEX I -2-6-59.”\\nIf the ALJ grants a claimant’s or representative’s reque st for additional time\\nto submit evidence after the hearing , the AL J will:\\n•Set a time limit for submitting  the evidence; and\\n•Inform the claimant and appointed representative (if any) that if the\\nALJ does not receive the evidence within the set time limit, the ALJ\\nwill issue a decision without considering the evidence (absent a\\nshowing  that the circumstances in 20 C.F.R. 404.935(b) and\\n416.1435(b) apply ).     \\n   \\nIn cases where there are multiple partie s to the hearing , and the evidence is\\nsubmitted by one party , “all other parties to the hearing  have the right to\\nreview the evidence. On receipt of the information, the ALJ must proffer the\\n175\\nevidence to the other parties to the hearing , unless the other parties have\\nwaived the rig ht to review the evidence. See HAL LEX I -2-7-1.”46 Id.\\n14.The AL J did not develop the record in accordance with SSR 17-4p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-4p clarifies SSA’s respon sibilities to develop\\nevidence and other information, and reiterates that “the administration need[ s]\\ncomplete evidentiary  records to make accurate, consistent disability\\ndeterminations and decisions[ .]” While claimants and their representatives\\nhave the primary  responsibility  to provide evidence, the Ruling  recog nizes\\nthat the Social Security  Act requires the administration to consider all\\navailable evidence,  develop a complete medical history  of at least the\\npreceding  twelve months, and “make every  reasonable effort to obtain from\\nthe individual’s treating  physician (or other treating  health care provider) all\\nmedica l evidence, including  diagnostic tests, necessary  in order to properly\\nmake such determina tion, prior to evaluating  medical evidence obtained from\\nany other source on a consultative basis.” 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(B ),\\n1382c(a)(3)(H)(i).  \\nFurther, a claimant has “info rmed” the SSA about evidence that it will then\\nrequest, when the claimant provides, at least five business days before the\\nhearing , “information specific enoug h to identify  the evidence (source,\\nlocation, and dates of treatment) and show that the evidence relates to the\\nindividual’s medical condition, work activity , job history , medical treatment,\\nor other issues relevant to whether or not the individual is disabled or blind.”\\nRuling 17-4p. If the SSA is not so informed, it will still assist in obtaining  the\\nevidence if one of the circumstances listed in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.935(b)  or\\n416.1535(b) applies.\\nThe Ruling  defines “every  reasonable effort ” as the SSA making  “an initial\\nrequest for evidence  from the medical source or entity  that maintains the\\nmedical evidence, and, at any time between 10 and 20 calendar  days after the\\ninitial request, if the evidence has not been received, we will make a follow-\\nup request to obtain the medical evidence necessary  to make a determination.”\\nId. Nevertheless, the SSA  “will first ask the individual or representative to\\nsubmit the evidence. However, if the individual or representative  shows that\\nhe or she is unable to obtai n the evidence despite good faith efforts or for\\nreasons beyond his or her control, we may request the evidence directly from\\nthe medical source or entity  that maintains the evidence.” Id.\\nB.SUBMISSIO N OF EVIDENCE - THE FIVE-DAY RUL E\\n1.The ALJ committed harmful error by not accepting  *** evidence that was\\nsubmitted [less than five business days prior to the hearing/after the hearing ]\\nbecause the claimant informed the ALJ about the evide nce at least five\\nbusiness day s before the hearing .\\n46 HAL LEX I -2-7-1 Post-hearing Evidence – Whe n Proffer Is Required is discussed at page 180, infra.\\n176\\n2.The AL J erred in not accepting  evidence from Dr.*** which was submitted\\nless than five business day s prior to the hearing , as the claimant actively  and\\ndilig ently  soug ht this evidence timely , but due to circumstances bey ond\\nhis/her control, the evidence was not timely  received.\\nApplicable law.

In relation\\nto the submission of evidence, a claimant has an ongoing duty to inform SSA\\n“about or submit all evidence known to you that relates to whether or not you\\nare blind or disabled,” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(a)(1), 416.912(a)(1) (emphasis\\nadded), while certain privileg ed communications  are not considered evidence. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(b), 415.913(b).  The oblig ation to submit evidence, or\\ninform the SSA of evidence, “applies at each level of the administrative\\nreview process, including  the Appeals Council level if the evidence relates to\\nthe period on or before the date of the [ALJ] hearing  decision.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1512(a)(1), 416.912(a)(1).\\nEvery  effort must be made to ensure the ALJ receives all evidence and, as\\nnow required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512, 416.9 12, SSA mandates that\\nclaimants “inform us about or submit any written evidence  . . . no later than 5\\nbusiness days before the date of the scheduled hearing .”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.935(a), 416.1435(a) (Emphasis added).  Lack of compliance may result in\\nan ALJ’s refusal to consider the evidence unless certain circumstances apply . \\nId.  Excusing  circumstances are that\\n(1)Our action misled y ou;\\n(2)You had a physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation(s) that\\nprevented you from informing  us about or submitting  the evidence earlier;\\nor\\n(3)Some other unusual, unex pected, or unavoidable circums tance beyond\\nyour control prevented you from informing  us about or submitting  the\\nevidence earlier. Ex amples include, but are not limited to:\\n  (i)You were seriously ill, and your illness prevented you from\\ncontacting  us in person, in writing , or throug h a friend, relative, or\\nother person;\\n(ii)There was a death or serious illness in y our immediate family ;\\n(iii) I mportant records were destroy ed or damag ed by  fire or other\\n177\\n accidental cause; or\\n(iv)You actively  and dilig ently soug ht evidence from a source and the\\nevidence w3.as not received or was received less than 5 business\\ndays prior to the hearing .\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.935(b), 416.1435(b).  \\nSSR 17-4p addresses the substance of a claimant’s disclosure, stating  that it\\nmust be “specific enoug h to identify  the evidence (source, location, and dates\\nof treatment) and show that the evidence  relates to the individual’s medical\\ncondition, work activity , job history , medical treatmen t, or other issues\\nrelevant to whether or not the individual is disabled or blind.”  If the requisite\\nspecificity  is not provided, SSA has not been “informed” within the meaning\\nof the reg ulations. \\nSSR 17-4p describes a representative’s duty  to submit evidence as derivative\\nof the claimant’s, but overlain by SSA’s rules of conduct and standards of\\nresponsibility .  Thos e rules impose affirmative duties on a representative to:\\n(1) “act with reasonable promptness to help  obtain the information or\\nevidence that the claimant must submit and forward the information or\\nevidence” as soon as practicable ; and (2) “assist a claimant in comply ing, as\\nsoon as practicable, with our requests for information or evidence.”  \\nSSR 17-4p states that a representative must provide competent assistance to\\nthe claimant and refrain from actions or behavior prejudicial to the fair and\\norderly  conduct of administrative proceeding s.  Failure to comply  risks\\ndisciplinary  action.  Nor is it ordinarily  sufficient for a representative to\\ninform SSA about evidence without first attempting  to obtain it as SSR 17-4p\\ncautions:\\nIn addition, it is only  acceptable for a representative to inform us about\\nevidence without submitting  it if the representative shows that, despit e\\ngood faith efforts, he or she could not obtain the evidence.  Simply\\ninforming  us of the existence of evidence without providing  it or waiting\\nuntil 5 days before a hearing  to inform us about or provide evidence when\\nit was otherwise available, may cause unreason able delay  to the\\nprocessing  of the claim, without good cause,  and may be prejudicial to the\\nfair and orderly conduct of our administrative proceeding s.  As such, this\\nbehavior could be found to violate our rules of conduct and could lead to\\nsanction proceeding s against the representative.\\nSSR 17-4p concedes that a representative’s violation “does not chang e\\n[SSA’s]  duties with respect to the development of the evidence.”   \\nSSR 17-4p also states that claimant’s duty  to submit or inform SSA about all\\nevidence known to him or her that relates to disability /blindness is ongoing\\nand requires disclosure of any additional evidence about which the claimant\\n178\\nbecomes aware.  Moreover, the duty applies at each level of the administrative\\nreview process but does not extend to evidence unrelated to the period on or\\nbefore the AL J’s decision.  \\n  \\nSSR 17-4p acknowledg es that the determination of whether evidence must be\\ndisclosed as related to a claim is a matter of judgment.  However, it imposes\\nan expectation that individuals will “exercise their reasonable good faith\\njudgment” in making  this determination.  This Ruling  notes that potentiall y\\nrelevant evidence “includes objective medical evidence , medical opinion\\nevidence, other medical evidence, and evidence from nonmedical sources.” \\nHALLEX I-2-6-52(E) addresses the policies where the “claimant or\\nrepresentative states during  the hearing  that there are outstanding  records to\\nsubmit.”  I n this circumstance:\\nthe ALJ will remind him or her of the duty to submit to the ALJ, no later\\nthan five business days before the scheduled hearing , all written evidence\\nknown to the claimant or any representative that relates to whether the\\nclaimant is blind or disabled (see 20 CFR  404.1512, 404.1740(b),\\n416.912(c), and 416.1540(b)).  An ALJ may declin e to admit evidence not\\ntimely  submitt ed, except under limited circumstances (see 20 CFR\\n404.935(b) and 416.1435(b); and HAL LEX I-2-6-59B ).  If an ALJ does\\nnot find that one of the limited circumstances applies, the ALJ will explain\\nin the decision why he or she did not consider the evidence, in accordance\\nwith HAL LEX I-2-6-59C. \\nNOTE:  Evidence generally  does not include a representative’s analy sis of\\nthe claim or oral or written communications  between a claimant and his or\\nher representa tive.  Whether or not a representative is an attorney  or non-\\nattorney , these communications would be subject to the attorney -clien t\\nprivileg e under our regulations.  See 20 CFR 404.1513(b) and 416.913(b).  \\n3.The ALJ erred by not obtaining  medical evidence despite being timely\\nadvised of the names and addresses of providers who had evidence  relevant to\\nthis claim.\\nApplicable law:  In 2015, the Comm issioner modified the regulations that\\ndefine the duty to submit evidence.  The regulations previ ously stated that the\\nclaimant “must furnish medical and other evidence” to prove disability , and\\nthat SSA will help the claimant get reports from the claimant’‘ medi cal\\nsources.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(a ), (d) (2014). But in 2015, the Commissioner\\namended these regulations to state that the claimant “must inform us about or\\nsubmit” evidence relating  to disability  during  the period on or before the date\\nof the administrative law judge hearing  decision.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(a)\\n(2017).\\nIn comments explaining  the chang es in the Regulation s, the Commissioner\\n179\\nstated that the claimant’s duty is to provide the names and addresses of\\nmedical sources, and that “we will then obtain the records from those\\nsources.”   80 Fed. Reg. 14828, 14834 (Mar. 20, 2015).  Under the 2015\\nRegulations, the ALJ has a duty to obtain records the claimant has\\ninformed SSA about.  Since the Commissioner has assumed responsi bility\\nfor obtaining  all information the claimant informs SSA about, and has\\nstated that the duty covers the entire period throug h the ALJ decision, the\\nALJ erred in not obtaining  all treatment records.\\n4.The ALJ erred in failing  to even mention medical evidence submitte d post-\\nhearing  but before the decision was issued.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§  404.935(b), 416.15 36(b) provides that if the\\nclaimant has evidence but has misse d the deadline for submission, the ALJ\\n“will accept the evidence if he or she has not yet issued a decision and you did\\nnot inform us about or submit the evidence before the deadline . . . .”  While\\nthe ALJ can provide reasons for not accepting  the evidence, remand is\\nrequired if the AL J fails to address the evidence at all.  Id.    \\n \\nC. CLAIMANT’S RIG HT TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE\\n1.The ALJ did not tender the post-hearing  evidence to the claimant as required\\nby HAL LEX I -2-7-1 and I -2-5-28(f).\\n \\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-7-1 provides that an ALJ will proffer to the\\nclaimant and appointed representative, if any, additional evide nce received\\nafter the hearing from a source other than the claimant or the appointed\\nrepresentative.  Concerning  interrog atory  responses from a medical or\\nvocational expert, proffer is required even if the interrog atory  responses were\\nobtained pre-hearing .\\nHowever, the ALJ is not required to proffer the evidence when the evidence\\nwas submitted by the claimant and there is no other party  to the hearing , when\\nthe claimant has knowing ly waived his/her right to examine the evidence, or\\nthe ALJ issues a fully  favorable decision. Id.  Proffering allows a claimant to\\n“[c]omment on, object to, or refute the evidence by  submitting  other evidence;\\nor “[i]f required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, cross-ex amine the\\nauthor(s) of the evidence.”  \\nHAL LEX I-2-5-28(F ) requires the ALJ disclose evidence obtained after the\\nhearing  from a source other than the claimant or representative:\\nIf an ALJ receives new evidence after the hearing  from a source other than\\nthe claimant or representative, if any, and the ALJ proposes to enter the\\nevidence into the record as an exhibit, the ALJ will follow the proffer\\n180\\nprocedures in HAL LEX I-2-7-1, I-2-7-30, and I-2-7-35.47 See HAL LEX I-\\n2-5-91-92, and I -2-6-99.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-30 addresses proffer proce dures. HALLEX I-2-7-30(A)\\nprovides that the proffer letter to the claimant and appointed representat ive, if\\nany, must include the following  information:\\n•A time limit to object to, comment on, or refute the proffered\\nevidence, and to submit a written statement as to the facts and law that\\nthe claimant believes apply  to the case in light of the evidence\\nsubmitted;\\n•A time limit to submit written questions to the author(s) of the\\nproffered evidence;\\n•An oppor tunity to exercise his or her right to request a supplemental\\nhearing , including  the opportunity  to cross-ex amine the author(s) of\\nany post-hearing  evidence; and\\n•The opportunity  and instructions for requesting  a subpoena for the\\nattendance of witnesses or the submission of records.\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-30(B ) addresses sending  the proffer letter and states:\\nIf a claimant is represented, [hearing  office (“HO”)]  staff will send the\\nproffer letter to the appointed repre sentative, with a copy  of the proffer\\nletter to the claimant.  HO staff will also include a copy  of the new\\nevidence if the representative does not have online access to the claim(s)\\nfile throug h the Appointed Repre sentative Services portal or when the\\nclaim(s) file is paper.\\nIf a claimant is unrepresented,  HO staff will usually  prepare a proffer\\nletter to the claimant (modify ing the letter as necessary ) and send the\\noriginal proffer letter and a copy  of the new evidence to the claimant.\\nHowever, if the additional evidence contains information that may be\\ndetrimental to the claimant’s health, the AL J will proffer as follows:\\nIf the claimant is represented, the ALJ will send a modified proffer\\nletter and a copy  of the evidence only  to the representative. In the\\nmodified letter, the ALJ will recommend that the representative not\\nshare the evidence with the claimant due to a possible detrimen tal\\nimpact on the claimant’s health and that the representative discuss the\\nevidence with the claimant only  in g eneral terms.\\nIf the claimant is unrepresented, the ALJ will give the claimant the\\n47 HAL LEX I -2-7-35 is discussed at page185, infra.\\n181\\nopportunity  to examine the evide nce in the HO or, if more convenient\\nto the claimant, in the servicing  field offic e (FO).  See HAL LEX I-2-7-\\n30 C below for instructions on proffering  throug h the FO. Althoug h\\nthe claimant has a right to examine the evidence, any HO staff\\ninvolved with presentation of the evidence to the claimant will make\\nall reasonable efforts to ensure that a relative or friend accompanies\\nthe claimant.\\nThe proffer can also be made by the field office (“FO”) in “unusual\\ncircu mstances, such as when evidence may be detrimental to the\\nclaimant’s health and the claimant is unrepresented, or when the claimant\\nwould be required to travel a significant distance to the [hearing  office]\\nbut lives near an F O . . . .”  HAL LEX I -2-7-30(C).  I n such circumstances:\\nThe ALJ will send a letter to the claimant advising  him or her of the\\nprocedure.  See HAL LEX I-2-7-93 for a sample letter.  The letter will\\nadvise the claimant of the following : \\n•The rig ht to ex amine and comment on the evidence; \\n•The rig ht to submit additional evidence or refute the new evidence;\\n•The right to ask the ALJ to send the evidence to the claimant’s\\ntreating  physician for comments;\\n•The right to request a  supplemental hearing  (if applicable under\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-1);\\n•The right to request the opportunity  to question the author of any\\npost-hearing  report;\\n•A statement that the FO will not be able to discuss the material\\nbecause the case is before the AL J; and\\n•A statement that the FO will provide the claimant a 10- day\\ntimeframe to ex amine the evidence.\\nBecause the ALJ is not sending  the additional evidence to the claimant in\\nthis situation, HO staff will prepare a list of the additional evidence to\\naccompany  the letter.  F or a sample list, see HALLEX I-2-7-94.48\\nAdditionally , regardless of whether the claim(s) file is electronic or paper,\\nHO staff will send a memorandum to the FO, asking  the FO to assist in\\narrang ing a 10-day  timeframe for the claimant to examine the additional\\nevidence.  For sample memorandum language, see HAL LEX I-2-7-95.49 \\n48 HAL LEX I -2-7-94, Sa mple - List of Addi tional Evidence.\\n49 HAL LEX I -2-7-95, Sa mple - Memorandum  to Field Of fice with Co py of Post-hearing Evidence\\n182\\nWith the memorandum, HO staff will send the following : \\n•A copy  of the AL J’s letter to the claimant;\\n•A list of additional evidence;\\n•A copy  of the proffered evidence; and\\n•An attachment to document that the claimant has reviewed the\\nevidence ( see HAL LEX I -2-7-96).50\\n2.The AL J erred in not addressing  the claimant’s comments reg arding  the post-\\nhearing  evidence in the hearing  decision.\\n3.The AL J erred in not ruling  on the claimant’s objections to the proffered\\nevidence.\\n4.The ALJ erred in not scheduling  a supplemental hearing  requested by the\\nclaimant.\\n5.The ALJ erred in not providing  any reasons for his/her rejection of the\\nclaimant’s rig ht to question the post-hearing  CE at a supplemental hearing . \\nApplicable law:  The ALJ is required to address any comments received in\\nthe “rationale of the written decision.”  HALLEX I-2-7-30(C )(2).  “If the\\nclaimant objects to the proffered evidence, the ALJ will make a formal ruling ,\\neither in the decision or by separate order.” Id.  If it is done by separate order,\\nthe ALJ must provide a copy  to the claimant and appointed  representative and\\nadd the order to the record.  Id.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-30(C)(1) addresses the circumstances when  the claimant\\nrequests additional time, a supplemental hearing , or the opportunity  to\\nquestion the author of the evidence:\\nIf, in response to a proffer of evidence, a claimant requests additional time\\nto submit comments, the ALJ will use the procedures in HAL LEX I-2-7-\\n20.  If the ALJ offered the opportunity  for a supplemental hearing  with\\nproffered evidence and the claimant reque sts a supplemental hearing , the\\nALJ must grant the request unless the ALJ has already  decided to issue a\\nfully  favorable decision.  The ALJ must grant the reque st even if the\\nopportunity  for a supplemental hearing  was offered by mistake.  If the\\nclaimant requests a supplemental hearing  when the ALJ appropriately  did\\nnot offer the opportunity, the ALJ has discretion to determine whether to\\ngrant the request.  When the ALJ determines a supplemental  hearing is not\\nnecessary, he or she will respond to the claimant in writing  and associate\\nthe writing  with the claim(s) file as an exhibit.  (If it does not cause\\n50 HAL LEX I -2-7-96, Sa mple - Exa mination of Evidence.\\n183\\nunreasonable delay  and is appropriate based on the circumstances, the\\nALJ may  address the issue in his or her decision rather than in a). \\nIf the claimant asks to question a medical or vocational expert who has\\nresponded to interrog atorie s, the ALJ will use the procedures in HAL LEX\\nI-2-5-4451 or I-2-5-58,52 as applicable. If the claimant requests an\\nopportunity  to question any other author(s) of post-hearing  evidence, the\\nALJ will evaluate whether questioning  the autho r is necessary  to inquire\\nfully into the matters at issue.  If it is necessary , the ALJ will determi ne\\nwhether to conduct the questionin g throug h live testimony  or written\\ninterrog atories.  Generally , an ALJ will not use interrog atories when there\\nmay be difficulty  anticipating  the questions that will arise.\\nNOTE 1:\\nIf the ALJ asks the author to appear for questioning  and the author\\ndeclines to appear voluntarily , see HAL LEX I -2-5-78.\\nNOTE 2:\\nIf the ALJ requests information from a Disability  Determination Services\\n(DDS) staff physician, consultat ive examiner, or DDS or FO personnel,\\nHO staff will use an “assistance request. ”  For more information on other\\ncomponent responsibilities on receipt of an assistanc e request, see\\ngenerally  Prog ram Operations Manual Sy stem (POMS) DI  29501.\\n6.The ALJ was required to schedule a supplemental hearing  as required by the\\nHAL LEX and providing the claimant with the opportunity  to cross-ex amine\\nthe medical ex pert who submitted a post-hearing  report.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-7-1 addresses  post-hearing  evidence\\nwhenever a proffer is required and provides that an ALJ will proffer to the\\nclaimant and appoin ted representative, if any, additional evidence received\\nafter the hearing  from a source other than the claimant or the appointed\\nrepresentative.

DIAB ETES MELLITUS (DM ) (SSR 14-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply with agency  instructions as delineated in SSR 14-2p\\nfor evaluating  the impact of diabetes mellitus on the claimant’s ability  to\\nwork.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p informs adjudicators about the potential effects\\nof diabetes mellitus. The Ruling  defines DM as “a chronic condition\\ncharacte rized by high blood glucose levels that result from the body ’s\\ninability  to produce or use insulin.”  The two major types of DM are Type 1\\nand Type 2, previously  characteriz ed, among  other thing s, as insulin-\\ndependent and non-insulin-dependent DM.\\n147\\nThe ruling  notes that Type 1 DM, which can occur at any age but often\\ndevelops in children , “usually  has the following  symptoms: polydipsia\\n(increased thirst); polyphag ia (increased appetite); polyuria (increased\\nurination); unex plained weig ht loss; fatig ue or drowsiness; and blurred\\nvision.” This type of diabetes requires the daily  administration of insulin,\\nwhich involves complex  decision-making  and prediction.  Type 2 DM causes\\nsimilar symptoms, but they are not usually  as obvious. Other symptoms of\\nthis type “include cuts or bruises that are slow to heal, numbness in the hands\\nand feet, or recurrent infections of the skin, gums, or bladder.”  Daily insulin\\nmight be required when diet and weig ht loss alone prove insufficient.\\nSSR 14-2p discusses the symptoms and compli cations of DM, along  with\\nrelated conditions such as obesity that can interact with the disease and cause\\nmore severe problems than each acting  alone.  Occurrences of hyperglycemia\\n(high blood glucose) cause such symptoms as frequent urination, blurred\\nvision, headaches, difficulty  concentrating , and abdominal pain or nausea.\\nSSR 14-2p also discusses hypoglycemia (low blood glucose), which causes\\nsymptoms and signs such as weakness, hung er, sweating , trembling ,\\nnervousness, palpitations, difficulty  with concentration, and additional\\nsymptoms in young  childr en.  The Ruling  acknowledg es that without proper\\ntreatment, the condition can becom e severe and even lead to permanent brain\\ndamag e or death.  An important consideration is whether the individual\\nexperiences hypogl ycemia unawareness, a dangerous condition that\\n“generally  occur s in people who have had DM for a long  time and\\nexperienced many  episod es of hypoglycemia.” Hypoglycemia unawareness\\n“puts a person at risk for severe hy poglycemia-related complications.”\\n2.The ALJ did not consider the impact of the claiman t’s obesity  on his/her\\ndiabetes mellitus on his/her ability  to work as required by SSR 14-2p and SSR\\n19-2p, which addresses the interaction between DM and obesity .\\nApplic able law:  SSR 14-2p recog nizes that “a person with DM and obesity\\nmay have more severe complicati ons than the effects of each of the\\nimpairments considered separately .”  More generally , SSR 14-1p states that\\n“[t]he combined effects of DM and another impairment(s) can be greate r than\\nthe effects of each of the impairments considered separately .”\\n  3.The ALJ did not comply with SSR 14-2 p in not addressing whether the\\nclaimant’s diabetes mellitus equals a listed impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p explains that while DM is not a listed\\nimpairment  for adults or children 6 and older, it may meet or equal a listing .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that chronic hyperg lycemia leads to complications\\nincluding  diabetic retinopathy , cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy ,\\nand diabetic neurop athy.  These complications may lead to the meeting  or\\nequaling of a listed impairment. An acute complication of hyperglycemia is\\ndiabetic ketoacidosis, which can be fatal.\\n148\\n4.The ALJ erred when s/he did not find that the child claimant’s diabetes\\nmellitus, which requires daily  insulin, meets the requirements of Listing\\n109.08.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p states that children with DM who require daily\\ninsulin and are under age 6 are to be found disabled under Listing  109.08. \\nThis is because such children are presumed not to have “developed the\\ncognitive ability  for recog nizing and responding  to hypoglycemia symptoms;\\nthat is, they have hypoglycemia unawareness .”  Due to this lack of awareness\\nand the life-threatening  conditions that can result, these children need near-\\nconstant visual contact from parents or caregivers.  Therefore, they have\\nimpairments that meet listing  109.08.”  After attainment of age 6, however, no\\nsuch presumption exists because ordinarily  “children develop the cognitive\\nability  for recog nizing and responding  to their hypoglycemia symptoms by\\nage 6.”\\n5.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s diabetes mellitus may equal a listed\\nimpairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-2p explains that while DM is not a listed\\nimpairment for children 6 and older, it may meet or equal a listing . Children 6\\nand older are evaluated on a case-by -case basis to ascertain whether they have\\ndeveloped awareness of their hypoglycemia symptoms.  Adjudicators must\\n“evaluate on an individual case basis whether children age 6 and older have\\ndeveloped cognitive awareness of their hypoglycemia symptoms” because\\nwithout this awareness, children who require daily  insulin require 24-hour-a-\\nday adult  supervision for medical reasons and are to be considered disabled\\nunder the functional equivalence rules.\\nThe current listing  of impairm ents  addresses DM in children 6 and older. \\nListing  109.00(C) provides:  \\nC. How do we evaluate DM in children?  Listing  109.08 is only for\\nchildren with DM who have not attained age 6 and who require daily\\ninsulin. For all other childr en (that is, children with DM who are age 6 or\\nolder and require daily  insulin, and children of any age with DM who do\\nnot require daily  insulin), we follow our rules for determining  whether the\\nDM is severe, alone or in combination with another impairment, whether\\nit meets or medically  equals the criteria of a listing in another body\\nsystem, or functionally  equals the listing s under the criteria in § 416.926a\\nof this chapter, considering  the factors in § 416.924a of this chapter. The\\nmanag ement of DM in children can be compl ex and variable from day to\\nday, and all children with DM require some level of adult supervisio n. For\\nexample, if a child age 6 or older has a medical need for 24-hour-a-day\\nadult supervision of insulin treatment, food intake, and physical activity  to\\nensure survival, we will find that the child’s impairment functionally\\nequals the listing s based on the example in § 416.926a(m)(2) of this\\nchapter.\\n149\\n6.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s diabetes mellitus may affect  a\\nchild’s functioning  in any  domain.\\nApplica ble law:  SSR 14-2p discusses how DM, alone or in combination\\nwith other impairments, may affect a child’s functioning  in any domain. \\nThe Ruling  proceeds to discuss examples  of interference with a child’s\\nabilities within the various domains, including  problem s arising  from\\nfatig ue, lack of concentration, or embarrassment.\\nD. ENDO CRINE  DISO RDE RS (OTHER THAN DIAB ETES\\nMELLITUS) (SSR 14-3p)40\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with the provisions of SSR 14-3p which provides\\nguidance for the proper evaluation of endocrine disorders (other than diabetes\\nmellitus).\\nApplicable law:  As SSR 14-3p notes, in 2011 the listing s for endocrine\\ndisorders were removed as obsolete.  This Rulin g supplies the guidance\\npromised at that time reg arding  the proper evaluation of such disorders.\\nSSR 14-3p notes that either too much or too little of a hormone from an\\nendocrine  gland can cause an endocrine disorder, resulting  in myriad\\ncomplications .  The Ruling  addresses disorders of the pituitary , thyroid,\\nparathy roid, and adrenal glands, as well as noting  pancreatic and gonadal\\ndisorders.  Symptoms, signs and/or treatment are identified for each.  In\\ndiscussing  the evaluation of these disorders during  the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, SSR 14-3p notes that the effects of various endocrine gland disorders\\nare relevant to the assessment of whether a listing  has been met or equaled,\\nand provides eight examples for adults, nine for children.  Howeve r,\\nendocrine disorders are not themselves listed impairments for adults, nor for\\nchildren apart from diabetes in young children (a disorde r addressed in SSR\\n14-2p).\\nSSR 14-3p address es disorders of the pituitary , thyroid, parathy roid, and\\nadrenal glands, in addition to briefly  mentioning  pancreatic and gonadal\\ndisorders.  In relation  to the first four, both hypofunction and hyperfunction\\nare discussed.  For example, hyperpituitarism may result in gigantism in\\nchildren and adults may develop acromeg aly.  Signs and symptoms of\\nacromeg aly can include joint pain or swelling  and vision abnormalities. \\nHypopituitarism , on the other hand, if associated with deficient production of\\nantidiuretic hormo ne may result in diabetes insipidus with excessive\\nurination, dehy dration, and electroly te imbalance.\\nHyperthy roidism, which may abnormally  increase the body’s metabolic rate,\\ncan produce altered mood, tremors1, heart palpitations, hypertension, weigh t\\n40Diabetes mellitus is addre ssed in SSR 14- 2p. \\n150\\nloss, bulging eyes, and goiter. Nevertheless, treatment normally  controls these\\nsymptoms and signs within 12 months.  Hypothyroidism, potentially\\nresponsible for weakness, fatig ue, dry or coarse skin, slow or depressed\\nspeech, and adverse mental chang es, can also generally be treated successfully\\nin less than 12 months.\\nOveractivity  of the parathy roid gland can cause cons tipation, nausea,\\nvomiting , fatig ue, osteoporosis, and kidney  stones.  According  to the Ruling ,\\n“[t]reatment includes surgical removal of the gland(s), which usually  resolves\\nthe problem.”   Hypoparathy roidism, which can “generally ” be controlled by\\nlifelong treatment with supplements and a special diet, can result in muscle\\ncramps, muscle spasms, ex cessive nervousness, and headaches.\\nThe Ruling  states that another group of disorders generally  controlled by\\ntreatm ent are those involving  dysfunction of the adrenal glands. Symptomatic\\nhyperadrenalism is characteriz ed by dysmorphic body chang es, increased\\nfacial and body hair in women, and the reduced ability  to fight infections. \\nHypoadrenalism is characteriz ed by generaliz ed weakness  and fatig ue,\\ndarkening  of skin, muscle wasting , loss of appetite, low blood pressure,\\nelectroly te imbalance, and depression.\\nPancreatic disorders are not discu ssed in detail in this Ruling  as diabetes\\nmellitus is specifically  covered by SSR 14-2p.  Lastly, SSR 14-3p notes that\\ncong enital gonadal dysfunction “is frequently  associated with chromosomal\\ndisorders or other genetic syndromes. Treatment involves lifelong hormone\\nreplacement therapy , which usually  controls this condition.”\\n2.The ALJ did not properly  consider whether the claimant’s endocrine disorder\\n(other than diabetes mellitus) may  equal a listed impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-3p offers examples of the effects of specific\\nendocrine disorders and the body  systems for evaluation:\\nHyperpituitarism :  Compromised use of the extremi ties due to\\ncomplications of boney  structures, under the musculoskeletal system\\nlisting s (1.00).\\nHypopituitarism :  ADH deficie ncy that is untreated or unresponsive to\\ntreatment resulting  in heart  failure or arrhy thmia, under the cardiovascular\\nsystem listings (4.00).\\nHyperthyroidism :  Irregular heartbeat or other cardiac dysfunction, under\\nthe cardiovascular system listing s (4.00);

and\\nintellectual disability  or other cognitive disorders resulting  from\\ninadequately  treated hypothy roidism, under the mental disorders listing s\\n(1200.00).\\n4.The ALJ did not consider that the child’s endocrine disorder (other than \\ndiabetes mellitus) may  affect a child’s functioning  in any  domain.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 14-3p observes that “[a]n endocrine disorder, alone or\\nin combination with another impairment(s), may affect a child’s functioning\\nin any domain.”  The Ruling  procee ds to discuss examples of interference\\nwith a child’s abilities within the various domains.\\nExamples given are that of a child with: (1) an inadequately  treated thyroid\\ndisorder  who may have limitations in attending  and completing  tasks due to\\n153\\ndifficulty  listening to the teacher, maintaining  focus, staying on task in the\\nclassroom, or excessive fatig ue; (2) panhy popituitarism after surgery for\\ncraniophary ngioma (a benig n tumor near the pituitary  gland), who may\\nexperience partial bilateral loss of visual fields and thus have  difficulty\\nmoving  about and manipulating  objects; (3) inadequately  treated growth\\nhormone deficiency  who may appear much young er than their chron ological\\nage and as a result have difficulty  interacting  and relating  with others, or have\\ndifficulty  shopping  or getting  an after school job because of being mistakenly\\nperceived as a much y oung er child.\\nE.FIBROMYAL GIA (FM ) (SSR 12-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 12-2p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s fibromy algia.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p sets forth three requirements for Fibromy algia\\nitself to be considered a medically  determinable impairment: a physician has\\ndiagnosed fibromy algia; (2) the physician has provided the evidence\\ndescribed either by the 1990 American Colleg e of Rheumatolog y (ACR)\\ncriteria or the 2010 ACR Preliminary  Diagnostic Criteria; and (3) the\\nphysician’s “diag nosis is not inconsistent with the other evidence in the\\nperson’s case record.”  Id.\\nSSR 12-2p recognizes the “considerable overlap” between the symptoms\\npresent in CFS and Fibromyalgia.  It explains that individuals with CFS who\\nhave tender points have a medically  determinable impairment, and that\\nclaimants with “impairments that fulfill the American Colleg e of\\nRheumatol ogy criteria for [Fibromy algia Syndrome]  (which includes a\\nminimum number of tender points) may also fulfill the criteria for CFS.”  Id. \\nThe Ruling  also states that, even in cases where the claimant does not have\\nthe tender points sufficient to establ ish Fibromy algia Syndrome, they “will\\nstill be found to have a medically  determinable impairment.”  Id.\\n2.The ALJ erred in not considering  the long itudinal record in evaluating  the\\nseverity  of the claiman t’s FM as SSR 12-2p recog nizes that FM symptoms\\ncan wax  and wane, with g ood and bad day s. \\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p twice emphasiz es the importance of long itudinal\\ninformation due to its recog nition that fibromy algia can involve varying signs\\nand symptoms.  First, it states that if a consultative examiner is hired, the CE\\nshould have access to long itudinal inform ation, as “the symptoms and signs of\\n[fibromy algia] may vary in severi ty over time and may even be absent on\\nsome days[.]”  Id.  Second, in discussing  the assessment of residual functional\\ncapacity , the Ruling  again stresses the importance of considering  “a\\nlongitudinal record whenever possible because the symptoms of\\n[fibromyalgia] can wax and wane so that a person may have ‘bad days and\\ngood day s.’”  Id.\\n154\\n3.Since fibromy algia is not a listed impairment, the ALJ must determine\\nwhether FM medically  equals a listing  or whether it medically equals a listing\\nin combination with at least one other medically  determinable impairment as\\nmandated under SSR 12-2p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 12-2p observes that while fibromyalgia cannot meet a\\nlisting  since there is no listing  for the condit ion, adjudicators must consider\\nwhether it medically equals a listing .  Id.  The Ruling  points to Listing\\n14.09D, which pertains to inflammatory  arthritis, as an example of a listing\\nthat might be equaled by a claimant suffering  from fibromy algia. Id. Further ,\\nthe Ruling  alludes to the possibility  that fibromy algia might equal a listing\\nwhen considered in combination with one or more other impairments.  Id.\\nF.  HEADACH ES (SSR 19-4p)\\n 1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s primary headaches are not a medically\\ndeterminable impairment is not consistent with SSR 19-4p.\\n2.The ALJ’s finding s regarding  the severity  of the claimant’s primary\\nheadaches do not comply  with SSR 19-4p.\\n3.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s [list type of headache]  are not a severe\\nimpairment is not consistent with SSR 19-4p as the record documents all\\nrequired finding s for this ty pe of headache.\\nApplicab le law:  Applicable to new applications filed on or after August 26,\\n2019, and to cases remanded from federal courts after that date, SSR 19-4p\\ndiscusses the evaluation by SSA of primary  headache disorders, including\\nmigraines, episodic and chronic tension-ty pe headaches, and trigeminal\\nautonomic cephalalg ias.  The Ruling  notes that in 2018 the third edition of the\\nInternational Classification of Heada che Disorders (“ICHD”) was published,\\nand that the Ruling  is based partly  on the criteria identified in this publication. \\nThe information in SSR 19-4p is presented in question and answer format.   \\n  \\nThe Ruling  notes that headaches may invo lve pain the scalp or neck rather\\nthan strictly  the head, and defines prim ary headaches as those occurring\\nindependently  of other medical conditions.  It discusses migraines, which it\\nclassifies as vasc ular headaches with or without aura; episodic and chronic\\ntension-ty pe headaches; and trigeminal autonomic cephalalg ias, which\\ninvolve one-sided pain, the most common being  clust er headaches.  SSR 19-\\n4p then specifies the diagnostic criteria for: migraine with aura, migraine\\nwithout aura, chronic tension-ty pe headaches , and cluster headaches.  This\\ncriteria is as follows:\\nMigraine with aura:  Migraine with aura are headaches not better accounted\\nfor by another ICHD diagnosis, as including  at least two headache attacks\\nwith at least one reversible aura symptom (visual, sensory , speech or\\n155\\nlanguage, motor, brainstem, retinal) and at least three of the following : one or\\nmore aura symptoms spreads gradually  over at least 5 minutes; two or more\\naura symptoms occur in succession; each aura symptom lasts 5 to 60 minutes;\\none or more aura symptoms is unilateral; one or more aura symptoms is\\npositive; or the aura is accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by\\nheadache.\\nMigraine without aura:  The diagnostic criteria for migr aine without aura\\nrequire at least five headache attacks lasting  4 to 72 hours and characteriz ed\\nby at least two of the following : unilateral location; pulsating  quality ;\\nmoderate or severe pain intensity ; or aggravation by or causing  avoidance of\\nroutine physical activity .  In addition, one or more of the following  must be\\npresent during  a heada che: nausea; vomiting ; or photophobia and\\nphonophobia .  SSR 19-4p also explains how to calculate the duration of a\\nmigraine attack, noting  that when the person falls asleep during  a migraine\\nand wakes up without it, the duration of the attack is measured up until the\\ntime of awakening\\nChronic tension-type headaches :  Chronic tension-ty pe headaches must\\noccurr, and have at least two of the following  characteristics: bilateral\\nlocation; pressing or tightening  quality ; mild or moderate intensity ; or not\\naggravated by routine physical activity .  Additionally , there may be “no more\\nthan one of photop hobia, phonophobia, or mild nausea; and [n]either\\nmoderate nor severe nausea nor vomiting .”  (footnote omitted).\\nCluster headaches :  Regarding  cluster headache, at least five headache\\nattacks must be severe or very  severe with unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or\\ntemporal pain lasting  15 to 180 minutes.  Additionally , there must be a sense\\nof restlessness or agitation and/or at least one of the following  occurring  on\\nthe same side of the body  as the headache: conjunctival injection; lacrimation;\\nnasal cong estion or rhinorrhea; eyelid edema; forehead and facial sweating ;\\nmiosis; or ptosis.  Finally , the headaches must occur with a frequency  between\\none every  other day  and eig ht per day .\\nWith regard to any headaches,  primary  headache disorders are diagnosed only\\nafter excluding  alternative causes of the symptoms.  The Ruling  notes that this\\nprocess may be aided by the sufferer’s keeping  of a “headache journal”\\ndetailing  relevant information about the headaches.  Imaging tests may be\\nused to rule out possible caus ative factors.  Secondary  headaches, which are\\nsymptoms of another condition, are not themselves  medically determinable\\nimpairments.  Imaging tests may be used to rule out possible causative\\nfactors.     \\n4.In accordance with SSR 19-4p, the ALJ was required to consider the impact\\nof the claimant’s photophobia on his/her ability  to work, which impacts the\\nclaimant’s ability  to sustain attention and concentration.\\n156\\nApplicable law.  SSR 19-4p provides that the effects of a claimant’s\\nheadaches must be assessed as with other impairments.  Concerning  RFC\\nassessment, the Ruling  provides the example that “symptoms a primary\\nheadache disorder, such as photophobia, may cause a person to have difficulty\\nsustaining  attention and concentration.”\\n5.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 19-4p in not considering  the claimant’s\\nheadache journal which supports his/her testimony  regarding  the severity  of\\nheadaches.\\n  6.The ALJ’s focus on the lack of a headache journal as a reason for rejectin g the\\nseverity  of the claimant’s headaches does not comply  with SSR 19-4p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 19-4p notes that primary  headache disorders are\\ndiagnosed only after excluding  alternative causes of the symptoms.  The\\nRuling  notes that this process may be aided by the sufferer’s keeping of a\\n“headache journal” detailing  relevan t information about the headaches. The\\nRuling  notes that while a headache journal may help with diagnosis, such\\nevidence is not required “in order to establish an MDI  of a headache disorder.\\n. . . We will, however, consi der evidence from a person’s “headache journal\\nwhen it is part of the recor d, either as part of the treatment notes or as separate\\nevidence, along  with all evidence in the record.”\\n7.The ALJ’s focus on the absence of imag ing tests in evaluating  the severity   of\\nthe claimant’s headaches is not consistent with SSR 19-4p.  \\nApplicable law:  SSR 19-4p explains that imag ing tests may be useful with\\ndiagnosis as the tests may help with ruling out other possible causes of\\nheadache symptoms.  However, the Ruling  explicitly  states that such testing\\n“is not required for a primary  headache disorder diag nosis.”\\n8.The ALJ was required to consider whether the claimant’s headaches were\\nmedically  equal to a listed impairment, as set forth in SSR 19-4p.\\nApplicable law. While there is no listed impairment cover primary  headache\\ndisorders,  SSR 19-4p notes that Listing  11.02, for epilepsy , “is the most\\nclosely  analog ous listed impairment for an MDI  of a primary  head ache\\ndisorder.”  Althoug h not comm on, “a person with a primary  headache\\ndisorder may exhibit equivalent signs and limitati ons to those detailed in\\nlisting 11.02 (parag raph B or D for dyscog nitive seizures), and we may find\\nthat his or her MDI (s) medically  equals the listing .”  For such uncommon\\ncases, the Ruling  should be consulted for its detailed discussion of how it can\\nbe established that L isting  11.02 has been equaled. \\n 9.The ALJ did not evaluate the child claimant’s headaches in accor dance with\\nSSR 19-4p, as required. \\n157\\nApplicable law.  SSR 19-4p explains that while it is phrased in terms on\\ninitial adult claims, its policy interpretations also apply  to claims of minors ,\\ncontinuing  disability  reviews of children and adults, and redeterminations\\nmade when a child receiving  payments turns 18.  SSR 19-4p also notes that in\\nchildren  migraine attacks may last 2-72 hours rather than the 4-72 hour period\\nlisted for adults.  \\nG.    INTERSTITIAL CYST ITIS (IC) (SSR 15-1p)\\n1.The ALJ ignored agency  policy  in evaluating  the claimant’s IC in accordance\\nwith SSR 15-1p which addresses interstitial cy stitis.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 15-1p, which rescinded and replaced SSR 02-2p,\\ndefines I C as:\\n[A] complex , chronic bladder disorder characteriz ed by urinary  frequency ,\\nurinary  urgency, and pelvic pain.  IC occurs most frequently  in women\\n(about 10 times more often than in men), and somet imes prior to age 18. \\nIC may be associated with other disorders, such as fibromy algia, chronic\\nfatig ue syndrome, allerg ies, irritable bowe l syndrome, inflammatory\\nbowel disease, endometriosis, and vulvod ynia (vulvar/vag inal pain).  IC\\nalso may  be associated with sy stemic lupus ery thematosus.\\nThe symptoms of IC may vary in incidence, duration, and severity .  The\\ncauses of IC are currently  unknown, and treatments are directed towards\\nrelief of symptoms.  While no treatment is uniformly  effective for\\nevery one, there are many treatments available, and individuals may obtain\\nsome measure of relief.  However, response to treatment is variable, and\\nsome individuals may have symptoms that are intractable to the current\\ntreatments available.  Treatment may include bladder distention; bladder\\ninstillation; oral drug s, such as the prescription drug  Elmiron,\\nantidepressants, antihistamines, and narcotic analg esics; and the use of\\ntranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. \\n2.The ALJ erred by not giving  proper credit to the claimant’s pain related to\\ninterstitial cystitis that resulted in exertional limits on the claimant’s ability  to\\nstand and walk.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 15-1p provides:\\nIC can cause limitation of function.  The functions likely  to be limited\\ndepend on many  factors, including  urinary frequency  and pain.  An\\nindividual may have limitations in any of the exertional functions such as\\nsitting , standing , walking , lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pulling .  It also\\nmay affect ability  to do postural functions, such as climbing , balancing ,\\nstooping , and crouching .  The ability  to tolerate extreme heat, humidity , or\\nhazards also may  be affected.\\n158\\n3.The ALJ did not adequately  evaluate the claimant’s medically determinable\\nimpairment of IC as it related to and supported a mental impairment as\\nprovided for in SSR 15-1p.\\nApplicable law:  A claiman t with IC may share mental impairment symptoms\\nas ex plained in SSR 15-1p:\\nAn individual with IC also may report symptoms suggestive of a mental\\nimpairment (for example, the individual may say that he or she is anxious\\nor depressed, having  difficulties with memory  and concentration, etc.).  If\\nthe evidence supports a possible discrete mental impairment or symptoms\\nsuch as anxiety or depression resulting from the individual’s IC or the side\\neffects of medication,  we will develop the possible mental impairment.  If\\nthe evidence does not establish a medically  determinable mental\\nimpairment but does establish the presence of symptoms such as anxiety\\nor depression resulting  from the individual’s IC or side effects of\\nmedication, we will determine whether there are any work-related\\nfunctional limitations resulting  from the symptoms.  We will address any\\nwork - related functional limitations at steps 4 and 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation process.\\nH.  MENTAL IMPAIRM ENTS\\n1.The ALJ erred in not evaluating  the claimant’s mental impairment and\\nresulting  functional limitations as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1 520a,\\n416.920a.\\n2.The ALJ erred in evaluating  the severity  of the claimant’s mental impairment\\nand associated functional limitations.\\nApplic able law:  When there is evidence of a mental impairment that\\nalleg edly prevents a claimant from working , the ALJ must follow the\\nprocedure for evaluating  mental impairments set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520 a, 416.920a.  In evaluating  the severity  of mental impairments, SSA\\n“must follow a special technique at each level in the administrative review\\nprocess” which helps to:\\na.Identify  the need for additional evidence to determine impairment\\nseverity ;\\nb.Consider and evaluate functional consequences of the mental\\ndisorder(s) relevant to y our ability  to work; and\\nc.Organize and present our findings in a clear, concise, and consistent\\nmanner.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(a), 416.920a(a).  SSA requires rating  the degree of\\nfunctional loss resulting  from the mental impairment in four areas:  (1)\\nunderstand, remember, or apply information; (2) inter act with others; (3)\\n159\\nconcentrate, persist, or maintain pace; and (4) adapt or manag e oneself.  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(c)(3), 416.920a(c)(3).\\nThese areas are rated on a scale that ranges from no limitation to a level of\\nseverity  which is “incompatible with the ability  to do any gainful activ ity”\\nusing  a SSA uses a five-point  scale: none, mild, moderate, marked, and\\nextreme.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(c )(4), 416.920a(c)(4). SSA uses these four\\ncriteria to determine whether a claimant suffers from a “severe” mental\\nimpairment and whether the claimant meets or equals a listed mental disorder. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(d)(1) and (d)(2), 416.920a(d)(1), and (d)(2).41  While\\nthe ALJ is no longer required to complete the PRTF, s/he instead, must\\n“document application of the technique in the decision.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520a(e)(2), 416.920a(e)(2).  The reg ulations provide:\\nAt the administrative law judge hearing  and Appeals Council levels, the\\nwritten decision issued by the administrative law judge or Appeals\\nCouncil must incorporate the pertinent finding s and conclusions based on\\nthe technique. The decision must show the significant history , including\\nexamination and laboratory  finding s, and the functional limitations that\\nwere considered in reaching  a conclusion about the severity  of the menta l\\nimpairmen t(s). The decision must include a specific finding  as to the\\ndegree of limitation in each of the functional areas described in parag raph\\n(c) of this section.\\nHAL LEX I-3-7-14(I ) states that the Appe als Council “will grant review and\\nmay remand a case if the ALJ did not properly  evaluate the claimant’s mental\\nimpairment(s) under 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and 416.920a, despite the clear\\npresence of a medically  determinable mental impairment.”\\n3.Remand is warranted given the ALJ’s contradictory  finding s regarding  the\\nseverity  of the claimant’s mental impairment(s).\\nAppl icable law:  An ALJ who finds that the claimant has a severe mental\\nimpairment, but, at the same time, concludes that the claimant’s mental\\nimpairment results in mild or no restriction in the ability  to understand,\\nremember or apply  information; (2) interact with others; (3) concentrate,\\npersist, or maintain pace; and (4) adapt or manag e oneself activities of daily\\nliving , makes internally  contradictory  finding s. The regulations provide that if\\nthe degree of limitation is rated “none” or “mild, “we will generally  conclude\\n41 After evaluating the above categories, the ALJ is required to determine whether a claimant suffers from\\na “severe” mental impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a , 416.920a .  If the degree of limitation is rated “none”\\nor “mild, “we will generally conclude that your impairment is not sever e, unless the evidence otherwise\\nindicates that there is more than a minimal limitation the claimant’s ability to do basic work activities.”  20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a (d)(1), 416.920a (d)(1).  If the mental impairment is severe, the next step is to determine\\nif it meets or equals a listed mental disorder.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a (d)(2), 416.920a (d)(2). If the\\nimpairment is not of listing severity, the third step is to determine the claimant’s RFC.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520a (d)(3), 416.920a (d)(3).\\n160\\nthat your impairment is not severe.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a(d)(1 ),\\n416.920a(d)(1).\\n4.The ALJ did not properly  explain the extent or scope of limitations recog nized\\nby the finding  of moderate limitations in the ability  to concentrate, persist, or\\nmaintain pace.\\nApplicable law :  “Concentrate, persist, and maintain pace” refers to:\\nthe abilities to focus attention on work activities and stay on task at a\\nsustained rate.  Examples includ e: Initiating  and performing  a task that\\nyou understand and know how to do; working  at an appropriate and\\nconsistent pace; completing  tasks in a timely  manner; ignoring  or avoiding\\ndistractions while working ; chang ing activities or work setting s without\\nbeing  disruptive; working  close to or with others without interrupting  or\\ndistracting  them; sustaining  an ordinary  routine and regular attendance  at\\nwork; and work ing a full day without needing  more than the allotted\\nnumber or length of rest periods during  the day.  These examples illustrate\\nthe nature of this area of mental functioning.  We do not require\\ndocumentation of all of the ex amples.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 12.00(e)(3).\\n5.Despite finding  that the claimant has severe mental impairments  resulting  in\\nmoderate difficulties in interacting  with others, the ALJ erred in not\\nincorporating  any social limitations into the RF C assessment.\\nApplicable law :  “Interact with others” refers to: \\nthe abilities to relate to and work with supervisors, co-workers, and the\\npublic.  Examples include: cooperating  with others; asking  for help when\\nneeded; handling  conflicts with others; stating  own point of view;\\ninitiating  or sustaining  conversation; understanding  and respond ing to\\nsocial cues (phy sical, verbal, emotional); responding  to requests, suggests,\\ncriticism, correction, and challeng es; keeping  social interactions free of\\nexcessive irritability , sensitivity , argumentativeness, or suspiciousness.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt.

See also 20 C.F.R. §\\n416.903(e). This regulation, which tracks the provisions of the Social Security\\nAct, 42 U.S.C. § 421(h), provides:\\nAn initial determination by a State agency  or the Social Securit y\\nAdministration that you are not disabled (or a Social Security\\nAdmi nistration review of a State agency ’s initial determination), in any\\ncase where there is evidence which indicates the existence of a mental\\nimpairment, will be made only after every  reasonable effort has been\\nmade to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psycholog ist has completed\\nthe medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual\\nfunctional capacity  assessmen t.  (See § 404.1616 the qualifications we\\nconsider necessary  for a psycholog ist to be a psycholog ical consultant and\\n§ 404.1617 for what we consider “reasonable effort”).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1503(e), 416.903(e).  There is some indication the\\nprovisions are relevant to the ALJ level. The statute refers to “[a]n initial\\ndetermination under subsection (a), (c), (g ), or (i) of this section[ ,]”  42 U.S.C.\\n§ 421(h), and subsection (c) of the section  pertains to the review of\\ndeterminations.\\n7.The AL J committed reversible error in rely ing on GAF  scores.\\n8.The AL J erred in equating  the GAF  scores to specific functional limitations.\\nApplicable law.  In the Fifth Editi on of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\nof Mental Disorders (“DSM-5”) (2013), “[i]t was recommended that the GAF\\nbe dropped from DSM-5 for several reasons, includ ing its conceptual lack of\\nclarity  (i.e., including  symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in its\\ndescriptors) and questionable psychometrics in routine practice.” DSM-5 at\\n16.  However, some treatmen t records will still contain GAF  scores, which the\\nALJ is required to evaluate as opinion evidence. SSA Administrative Messag e\\nAM-13066, effective J uly 22, 2013,42 states:\\nAs with other opinion evidence, the extent to which an adjudicator can\\nrely on the GAF rating  as a measure of impairment severity  and mental\\nfunctioning  depends on whether the GAF rating is consistent with other\\nevidence,  how familiar the rater is with the claimant, and the rater’s\\nexpertise.\\nHowever, the GAF  score is “never dispositive of impairment severity ” and a\\nparticular GAF  score should not be equated with a listing -level limiter  or a\\nparticular mental residual functional capacity  assessment.

OBESITY (SSR 19-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not properly  apply  SSR 19-2p in evaluating  the severit y and\\nfunctional limitations of the claimant’s extreme obesi ty, as indicated by\\nhis/her weig ht of *** pounds.\\nApplicable law:  Social Security  Ruling  19-2p, effective May 20, 2019,\\nprovides that practitioners diagnose obesity , characteriz ed by excessive body\\nfat, on the basis of “a person’s medical history , physical examinations, and\\nbody  mass index  (BMI).”  However, the condition “is defined  as a BMI of\\n30.0 or higher.”  In addition, practitioners may diagnose obesity , even where\\nBMI is in the normal range, based on waist measurement.  The Ruling\\nrecog nizes that people who store fat in this area may have an increased risk of\\nobesity -related complication s, a risk that increases with a waist size greater\\nthan 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men.  \\nSSR 19-2p clarifies that a diagnosis of obesity  is not used to establish obesity\\nas an MDI .  Rather, finding s from an acceptable medical source “that may\\nestablish an [medically  determinable impairment]  of obesity  include measured\\nheight and weight, measured waist size, and BMI measurements over time.” \\nAlthoug h obesity  can be defined by BMI, the Ruling  acknowledg es that a\\nclaimant “who has a BMI of 30 or above may not have an MDI  of obesity  if a\\nlarge percentag e of the person’s weig ht is from muscle.”  However, the\\nadmini stration is not willing  to purchase tests to measure a claimant’s body\\nfat.  \\nSSR 19-2p explains when obesity  is considered a severe impairment.  The\\nseverity  of obesity  is determined not by the claimant’s particular weig ht or\\nBMI, but by the totality  of evidence including  all symptoms and funct ional\\nlimitations.  The Ruling  also notes that terms used by medical sources\\nseeming ly denotative of severity , like “severe,” “extreme,” or “morbid,” do\\nnot show that obesity  is a severe impairment.    \\n2.The ALJ failed to adequately evaluate the functional impact of the claimant’s\\nsevere medically  determinable impairment of obesiy  on his/her RFC as\\nrequired by  SSR 19-2p.\\n163\\nApplicable law:  When obesity  is a severe impairment, the assessed RFC\\nmust include corresponding  obesity -related limitations.  According  to SSR 19-\\n2p, since obesity increases stress on weig ht-bearing  joints, it may contribute\\nto range of motion limitations of both the skeletal spine and extremities. \\nAddition ally, it may cause manipulative limitations due to fatty  tissue in the\\nhands and fingers; an inability  to tolerate extreme heat, humidity , or hazards;\\nor limitations  in the physical or mental ability  to sustain work activity .  When\\nassessing  RFC, an adjudicator should also consider that the effects of obesity\\ncombined with other impairments may be greater than their individual effects.\\n3.The ALJ erred by not considering  whether the claimant’s obesity  equa ls a\\nlisting  given the claimant’s difficulty  ambulating  without an assistive device\\n[or due to other impairments] .\\nApplicable law: The regulations provide that a claimant is eligible for\\nbenefits if his/her impai rments, or combination of impairments, meets or\\nequals an impairment found in the Listing  of Impairments. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520( d), 416.920(d); 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1.  Medical\\nequivalence will be found when the impairment “at least equal in severity  and\\nduration to the criteria of any listed impairment.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.15 26(a),\\n416.926(a).43  SSR 02-1p (before May  20, 2019) discussed when obesity  may\\nbe medically  equivalent to a listed impairment:\\nWe may also find that obesity , by itself, is medically  equivalent to a listed\\nimpairment . . . .  For example, if the obesity  is of such a level that it\\nresults in an inability  to ambulate effectively , as defined in sections\\n1.00(B )(2)(b) or 101.00(B )(2)(b) of the listing s, it may substitute for the\\nmajor dysfunction of a joint(s) due to any cause (and its associated\\ncriteria), with the invo lvement of one major peripheral weig ht-bearing\\njoint in listing s 1.02A or 101.02A, and we will then make a finding  of\\nmedical equivalence.\\nId. SSR 19-2p, which rescinded and replaced SSR 02-1p effective May  20,\\n2019, notes that while obesity  is not a listed impairment, the functiona l\\nlimitations it causes may medically  equal a listing .  This may occur with\\nobesity  alone or in combination with other impairments, based on the\\nparticular information in the record.  Id.\\n“Inability  to ambulate effectively ” is defined by  regulation as:\\nInability  to ambulate effectively  means an extreme limitation of , the\\nability  to walk; i.e., an impairment(s) that interferes very seriously  with\\nthe individual’s ability  to independentl y initiate, sustain, or complete\\nactivities. Ineffective ambulation is defined generall y as having\\ninsufficient lower extremity  function . . . to permit independent\\nambulation without the use of a hand-held assistive device(s) that limits\\n43 See page 130, supra for a discussion of medical equivalence in adults and chi ldren.\\n164\\nthe functioning  of both upper ex tremities . . . .\\nTo ambulate effectively , individuals must be capable of sustaining  a\\nreasonable walking  pace  over a sufficient distance to be able to carry  out\\nactivities of daily  living.   They  must have the ability  to travel without\\ncompanion assistance to and from a place of employment or school. \\nTherefore, examples of ineffective ambulation include, but are not limit ed\\nto, the inability to walk without the use of a walker, two crutches or two\\ncanes, the inability to walk a block at a reasonable pace on rough or\\nuneven surfaces, the inability to use standard public transportation, the\\ninability to carry out routine ambulatory activities, such as shopping and\\nbanking, and the inability to climb a few steps at a reasonable pace with\\nthe use of a single hand rail. The ability  to walk independently  about\\none’s home without the use of assistive devices does not, in and of itself,\\nconstitute effective ambulation.\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(B )(2)(b) (Emphasis added).\\n4.The ALJ did not consider the impact of the claimant’ s obesity  on his/her\\ndiabetes mellitus on his/her ability to work as required by SSR 14-2p which\\naddresses the interaction between DM and obesity .\\nApplicab le law:  SSR 14-2p recog nizes that “a person with DM and obesity\\nmay have more severe complications than the effects of each of the\\nimpairments considered separately .”  More generally , SSR 14-1p state s that\\n“[t]he combined effects of DM and another impairment(s) can be greater than\\nthe effects of each of the impairments considered separately .”\\nJ. REFLEX SYM PATHETIC DYST ROPHY (RSD) (SSR 03-2p)\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 03-2p in evaluating  the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s RSD.\\nApplicable law: SSR 03-2p pertains to evaluating  “cases involving  reflex\\nsympathetic dystrophy /complex regional pain syndrome.” SSR 03-2p\\nspeci fically  notes that this impairment can be established in the presence of\\n“persistent complaints of pain that are typically  out of prop ortion to the\\nseverity  of any documented precipitant”  as well as one or more of the\\nfollowing  clinically  documented signs in the affected region at any time:  (1)\\nswelling ; (2) autonomic instability --seen as chang es in skin color or texture,\\nchang es in sweating (decreased or excessive sweating ), chang es in skin\\ntemperature, and abnormal pilomotor erection (gooseflesh); (3) abnormal hair\\nor nail growt h (growth can be either too slow or too fast); (4) osteoporosis; or\\n(5) involuntary  movements of the affected reg ion of the initial injury .\\nThe Ruling  also states that “pain is an expected symptom of this disorder,”\\nand that other sympto ms, such as “extreme sensitivity  to touch or pressure, or\\n165\\nabnormal sensations of heat or cold, can also be associated with this disorder.” \\nId.  This Ruling  recog nizes that persistent clinical prog ression resulting  in\\nmuscle atrophy , despite appropriate diagnosis and treatment, “hallmark a poor\\nprog nosis.”  Id. SSR 03-2p also recog nizes that “[o]pinions from an\\nindividual’s medical sources, especially  treating  sources, concerning  the\\neffect(s) of RSDS/CRPS on the individual’s ability  to function in a sustained\\nmanner in performing  work activities, or in performing  activities of daily\\nliving , are important in enabling  adjudicators to draw conclusions about the\\nseverity of the impairment(s) and the individual’s RFC.”  Id.  Moreover, SSR\\n03-2p provides that the chronic pain and medications prescribed to treat\\nchronic pain may impact a claimant’s ability  to maintain attention and\\nconcentration and the importance of a treating  physician’s opinion  in\\nevaluating  this impairment.\\nSSR 03-2p specifically  addresses the evaluation of younger individuals with\\nRSD, stating  that:\\na finding  of “disabled” is not precluded for those individuals under age 50\\nwho do not meet all of the criteria of a speci fic rule and who do not have\\nthe ability  to perform a full range of sedentary  work.  The conclusion\\nabout whether such individuals are disabled will depend primarily  on the\\nnature and ex tent of their functional limitations or restrictions.\\n2.The ALJ did not comply  with SSR 03-2p in not addressing  the impact of the\\nmedications the claimant takes for his/her chronic pain.\\nApplicable law:  Social Secu rity Ruling  03-2p specifically  addresses chronic\\npain, stating :\\nChronic pain and many  of the medications prescribed to treat it may affect\\nan individual’s ability to maintain attention and concentration, as well as\\nadversel y affect his or her cognition, mood, and behavior, and may even\\nreduce motor reaction times.  These factors can interfere with an\\nindiv idual’s ability  to sustain work activity  over time, or preclude\\nsustained work activity  altog ether.  When evaluating  durati on and\\nseverity , as well as when evaluating  RFC, the effects of chronic pain and\\nthe use of pain medications must be carefully  considered.\\nK.SICK LE CELL DISE ASE  (SCD) (SSR 17-3p)\\n1.The ALJ erred by ignoring  the SSR 17-3p requirements for properly\\nevaluating  the claimant’s sickle cell disease.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-3p acknowledg es that sickle cell disease (“SCD”)\\n“is not alway s easy to evaluate due to its varying nature and complications.” \\nThe Ruling  explain s that the inherited disease, which affects the hemog lobin\\nwithin red blood cells, causes blockag es that slow or stop the flow of blood\\n166\\nand oxygen.  People with the disease “are predisposed to pain, infection, and\\nother complications.”  Id. Laboratory  blood tests establish both the existence\\nand variants of SCD.  The Ruling  notes that HbSS is the most common and,\\nusually , most severe  form, whereas sickle cell trait alone is not an impairment\\nunless it results in complications.\\nThe Ruling  recognizes that a common complication of SCD is pain crisis,\\nwhich can be acute or chronic.  Acute pain crises can be intense and “strike\\nalmost anywhere in the body  and in more  than one spot at a time.”  Id.  “It\\nusually  occurs when lack of oxygen to the bone due to vaso-occlusion results\\nin the death of bone tissue (avascular necrosis) at various joints such as the\\nhips, shoulders and ankles.”  Id.  Other complications can include anemia\\ncausing  organ or nerve damag e with symptoms such as fatigue, weak ness,\\nshortness of breath, and dizziness.  Additionally , SCD sufferers can\\nexperience pulmonary  complications, severe bacterial infections, mental\\ndisorders, strokes, and silent strokes.\\nUnless the claimant’s SCD, alone or in combination with other impai rments,\\nmeets or equals the criteria of a listing , the RFC assessment must proceed\\nwith consideratio n of the effects of SCD such as “pain, fatigue, and shortness\\nof breath that may affect [the claima nt’s] ability  to stand and walk.  In\\naddition, a person experiencing  repeated acute pain crises may have difficulty\\nmaintaining  concentration to complete tasks and have frequent absences from\\nwork.”  Id.\\nL.  VISUAL  IMPAIRM ENTS (SSR 85-15)\\n1.The ALJ should have obtain ed vocational expert testimony  considering  the\\nclaimant’s visual impairment resulting  in non-ex ertional limitations.44\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 96-9p, since “[ m]ost sedentar y unskilled\\noccupations require working  with small objects,” if:\\na visual limitation prevents an individual from seeing  the small objects\\ninvolved in most sedentary  unskilled work, or if an individual is not able\\nto avoid ordinary  hazards in the workplace, such as boxes on the floor,\\n44 Note: The ALJ is not required to do so, unless in the Third or Eighth Circuit, or if only non-exertional\\nlimitations are involved.  HAL LEX I-2-5-50(B)  states that  when directed by the Appe als Council or a court\\nor if an Ac quiescence Ruling (AR), such as one of the following, requires VE e vidence: \\nThird Circuit (Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania): AR 01-1(3): Sykes v.

These cases may require the\\nuse of vocational resources.\\n2.The ALJ erred by not comply ing with SSR 83-14 and SSR 85-15 concerning\\nthe limitations resulting  from the claimant’s visual impairment.\\nApplicable law:  SSR  83-14 provides that a claimant’s remaining\\noccupational base will be significantly  diminished for both light and medium\\nwork where the claimant has –visual impairmen t which, while not of Listing\\nseverity , “causes the person to be a hazard to self and others -- usually  a\\nconstriction of visual fields rather than a loss of acuity  -- the manife stations of\\ntripping  over boxes while walking , inability to detect approaching  persons or\\nobjects, difficulty in walking  up and down stairs, etc.[ .]”  SSR 85-15 also\\nstates that: \\n. . . even if a person’s visual impairment(s) were to eliminate all jobs that\\ninvolve very good vision (such as working  with small objects or reading\\nsmall print), as long  as he or she retains sufficien t visual acuity  to be able\\nto handle and work with rather large objects (and has the visual fields to\\navoid ordinary hazards in a workplace), there would be a substantial\\nnumber of jobs remain ing across all exertional levels.  However, a finding\\nof disability  could be appropriate in the relatively  few instances in whic h\\nthe claim ant’s vocational profile is extremely  adverse, e.g., closely\\napproaching  retirement age, limited education or less,  unskilled or no\\ntransferable skills, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field of\\nwork in which g ood vision is essential.\\nIV. ADM INISTRATIVE PRO CEDURAL ISSUES\\nA. ALJ’S DUT Y TO DEVELOP THE RECORD \\n1.The ALJ did not fulfill his/her duty to develop the claimant’s complete\\nmedical history  as required by the Social Security  Act, regulations, and SSR\\n17-4p.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 17-4p acknowledg es that by  statute SSA: \\nshall consider all evidence available in [an] individual’s case record, and\\nshall develop a complete medical history  of at least the prece ding twelve\\nmonths for any case in which a determination is made that the individual\\nis not under a disability .\\nSSR 17-4p (citing  42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(5)(B ), 1382c(a)(3)(H)(i)).  The statute\\nfurther requires SSA to “make every  reasonable effort to obtain from the\\nindividual’s treati ng physician (or other treating  health care provider) all\\n168\\nmedical evidence, including  diagnostic tests, necessary  in order to properly\\nmake such determination, prior to evaluating  medical eviden ce obtained from\\nany other source on a consultative  basis.”  42 U.S.C. §§ 423(d)(5)(B ),\\n1382c(a)(3)(H)(i).   \\nThe regulations provide that prior to making  a deter mination that a claimant is\\nnot disabled, SSA will develop the claimant’s complete medical history  for at\\nleast the 12 months preceding  the month in which the application is filed\\n“unless there is a reason to believe that development of an earlier period is\\nnecessary  or unless you say that your disabil ity began less than 12 months\\nbefore you filed your application.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(d) and 416.912(d).\\nFurther, SSA will make “every  reasonable effort to help [the claimant]  get\\nmedical reports from your own medical sources when you give us permission\\nto request the reports.”  Id.   \\nSSR 17-4p defines “every  reasonable effort” to mean that SSA “will make an\\ninitial request for evidence from the medical source or entity  that maintains\\nthe medical evidence, and, at any time between 10 and 20 calendar days after\\nthe initial request, if the eviden ce has not been received,” a follow-up request\\nwill be make “to obtain the medical evidence necessary  to make a\\ndetermination.”  Id.45  \\n2.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the claimant, throu gh his/her representative,\\nto ask witnesses [the VE, the ME, the lay witnesses, etc.] questions material to\\nthe issues.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations unequivocally  provide that at the hearing\\nthe ALJ “may ask the witness any questions material to the issues and will\\nallow the parties or their designated representatives to do so.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.950(e), 416.1450(e) (emphasis added). Permitting  the parties to do so is\\nthus not a matter of discretion. \\n3. The ALJ erred in not ordering  a consultative examination in this case due to\\nthe paucity  of available evidence.   \\n4.As the ALJ rejected all medical opinions of record, the ALJ implicitly  foun d\\nthat the evidence was insufficient and should have further devel oped the\\nrecord by  obtaining  a consultative ex amination.    \\n45 SSR 17-4p states that the agency’s responsibilities do not “reduce the claimant’s responsibilities in any\\nway.”  While SSA has a duty to develop the record, claimants and their representatives have the primary\\nresponsibility to provide suppor ting evidence and are expected “to make good faith efforts to ensure that”\\nSSA receives all evidence known to the claimant that relates to disability or blindne ss.  The claimant or\\nrepresentative will be asked to submit evidence, but “if the individual or representative shows that he or she\\nis unable to obtain the evidence despite good faith efforts or for reasons beyond his or her control,” SSA “may\\nrequest the evidence directly from the medical source or entity that maintains the evidence.”\\n169\\n5.The ALJ erred in not recontacting  the claimant’s treating  medical provider\\ngiven the ALJ’s finding  that the evidence from this provider was insufficient\\nand or inconsistent. \\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court of the United States stated in Sims v.\\nApfel , 530 U.S. 103, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 2085, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000) that “Social\\nSecurity  proceeding s are inquisitorial rather than adversarial” and that the\\nALJ has the duty “to investig ate the facts and develop the arguments both for\\nand against granting  benefits.”  Id. (citing  Richardson v. Perales , 402 U.S.\\n389, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)).  See also HALLEX I-2-6-56,\\nAdducing  the Evidence) (states that an “ALJ has a duty to ensure that the\\nadministrative record is fully  and fairly  developed”).\\nThe reg ulations provide for ordering  consultative ex aminations:\\nWe may ask you to attend one or more consultative examinations at our\\nexpense.  See §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t for the rules governing the\\nconsultative examination process. Generally , we will not request a\\nconsultative examination until we have made every reasonable effort to\\nobtain evidence from your own medical sources.  However, in some\\ninstances, such as when a source is known  to be unable to provide certain\\ntests or procedures or is known to be nonproductive or uncooperative, we\\nmay order a consultative examinati on while awaiting  receipt of medical\\nsource evidence. We will not evaluate this evidence until we have made\\nevery  reasonable effort to obtain evidence from y our medical sources.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1512(b)(2), 416.912(b)(2).\\nIn some cases, SSA may not be able to make a “determination or decision\\nbecause the evidence” is “insufficient or inconsistent.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b), 416.9 20b(b).  Evidence is considered to be insufficient “when\\nit does not contain all the information we need to make our determination or\\ndecision” and evidence is inconsistent “when it conflicts with other evidence,\\ncontains an internal conflict, is ambig uous, or when the medical evidence\\ndoes not appear to be based on medically acceptable clinical or laboratory\\ndiagnostic techniques .  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b), 416.920b(b).  In such\\ncases, SSA “may  need to take the additional actions” as set forth in\\n“parag raphs (b)(1) throug h (4) of this section.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b),\\n416.920b(b).  \\nIn cases where the evidence in the case record as well as “any  medical\\nopinion(s ) and prior administrative medical finding s,” is inconsistent, SSA\\n“will consider the relevant eviden ce and see if we can determine whether you\\nare disabled based on the evidence we have.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b)(1),\\n416.920b(b)(1).  In cases where the evidence in the case record is consistent\\n“but we have insufficient evidence to determine whether you are disabled, or\\nif after considering  the evidence we determine we cannot reach a conclusion\\n170\\nabout whether you are disabled,” SSA “will determine the best way to resolve\\nthe inconsistency  or insufficiency  which “depend[ s] on the nature of the\\ninconsistency or insufficiency.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b(b)(2),\\n416.920b(b)(2).  SSA will “try to resolve the inconsistency  or insufficiency ”\\nby taking  any one or more of the following  actions:  \\n•Recontact the claimant’ s medical source . 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)( 2)(i), 416.920b (b)(2)(i). However, SSA may “choose\\nnot to seek additional evidence or clarifica tion from a medical source\\nif we know from experience that the source either cannot or will not\\nprovide the necessary  evidence.” Id. Also, in cases where the medical\\nevidence is obtained over the telephone, SSA “will send the telephone\\nreport to the source for review, sig nature, and return.” Id. \\n•Request additional existing evidence. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)(2)(ii), 416.920b (b)(2)(ii).\\n•Ask the claimant to undergo a consultative examination “at our\\nexpens e (see §§ 404.1517 throug h 404.1519t).” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b(b)(2)(iii), 416.920b (b)(2)(iii).\\n•Ask the claimant or others for more information . 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b (b)(2)(iv), 416.920b (b)(2)(iv). \\nIn cases where the inconsistencies in the evidence cannot be resolved, or\\nwhere “despite effor ts to obtain additional evidence, the evidence is\\ninsufficient to determine whether you are disabled,” SSA “will make a\\ndetermination or decision based on the evidence we have.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1520b (b)(3), 416.920b (b)(3).  SSA is not required to “take all of the\\nactions listed” above and will “consider any additiona l evidence we receive\\ntogether with the evidence we already  have.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520b (b)(2),\\n416.920b(b)(2).    \\n6.The ALJ erred in not ordering  a psycholog ical examination in this case given\\nthe lack of support for the claimant’s sy mptoms in the record.\\nApplicable law :  20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1529(b), 416.929(b) provides that:\\n[w]e will develop evidence regarding the possibility  of a medically\\ndeterminable mental impairment when we have information to suggest\\nthat such an impairment exists, and you alleg e pain or other symptoms but\\nthe medical signs and labor atory finding s do not substantiate any physical\\nimpairment(s) capable of producing  the pain or other sy mptoms.\\n7. The ALJ erred by not obtaining the claimant’s prior claim file which was\\nrelevant for the current claim.\\nApplicable law:  SSA is obligated to develop a claimant’s “complete medical\\n171\\nhistory  for at least the 12 months preceding  the month in which you file your\\napplication” unless more historical development is needed.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1512(d), 416.912(d).

See HAL LEX I-2-1-13 addressing\\nwhen a prior claim file is required.\\n8.The ALJ disreg arded his/her duty to develop the record by not issui ng a\\nneeded subpoena.\\n9.The ALJ committed reversible error in not issuing  a subpoena to obtain the\\nrecords of the claimant’s former treating  physician, whose records the\\nclaimant was unable to obtain.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5-78(A) provides that a claimant can request\\nan AL J to issue a subpoena under certain circumstances:\\nWhen it is reasonably  necessary  for the full presentation of a case, an\\nadministr ative law judge (ALJ) may issue a subpoena on his or her own\\ninitiati ve or at the request of a claimant or appointed representative.  See\\n20 C.F.R. 404.950(d) and 416.1450(d).  An ALJ may issue a subpoena for\\nthe appearance and testimony  of a witness(es), and to produce books,\\nrecords, correspondence, papers, or other documents that are material to\\nan issue at the hearing .  For example, an ALJ may find a subpoena\\nnecessary when a person having  knowledg e of a material fact or\\npossession of documentary  evidence is reluctant or unwilling  to testif y or\\nprovide the evidence.\\nThe claimant seekin g a subpoena must submit a request in writing  at least\\nten days prior to the hearing.

The\\nALJ may also delay  ruling  on the subpoena until developmen t can be\\ncompleted if “the requested information or testimony  is not part of the record,\\nbut has already been requested or can be developed by hearing  office staff.” \\nAdditionally :\\nIf development is completed and it is clear that the usual procedur es used\\nto obtain the information or testimony  have been unsuccessful, the ALJ\\nwill determine whether issuing  a subpoena for the requested information\\nor testimony  is reasonably  necessary  for a full presentation of the case. \\n[Moreover]  [i]f the claimant is requesting  a subpoena to obtain testimony\\nfrom an author of a written report , the ALJ must carefully  consider\\nwhether a cross-ex amination is required for a full presentation of the case.\\nId.  A subpoena can also be issued on the ALJ’s initiative “when an individual\\nhas information or can offer testimony  that the ALJ determines is reasonably\\nnecessary  for the full present ation of the case and all other means of obtaining\\nthis infor mation or testimony  have been exhausted.”  However, while ME, VE\\nand consultative examiners who will not appear voluntarily  may also be\\nsubpoenaed to appea r under the same standard applicable to other witnesses,\\n“an ALJ will usually  attempt to obtain testimony  from these  individuals via\\nvideo teleconferencing  or by  telephone.”\\nIf the ALJ denies the claimant’s request for a subpoena, “the ALJ must notify\\nthe claimant of the denial, either in writing  or on the record at the hearing ”\\nand must “enter the request into the record as an exhibit.” HAL LEX I-2-5-\\n78(D).  In those cases where the denial is in writing , “the ALJ will also enter\\nthe denial notice into the record as an exhibit.” The ALJ must “explain why\\nthe AL J declined to issue a subpoena.”\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-82  states that “[i]f an individual refuses or fails to comply\\nwith a subpoena, the administrativ e law judge (ALJ) will consider any chang e\\nin circumstance since issuing  the subpoena and re-evaluate whether the\\neviden ce or facts requested are reasonably  necessary  for the full presentation\\nof the case.”  In such cases, the ALJ “will prepare a memorandum to the\\n[OGC]  Regional Chief  Counsel requesting  enforcement of the subpoena.” \\n173\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-82 addresses contempt proceeding s and states that “[i]f OGC\\nobtains an order from the court , the failure of any subpoenaed individual to\\nappear as a witness at a hearing  or provide requested documents or facts may\\nresult in contempt proceeding s.”\\n10.The ALJ did not comply  with the duty to develop the record as to the\\nclaimant’s mental RF C.\\nApplicable  law:  SSR 85-16 observes that the reports of treating  sources may\\ndisclose other, previously  unreported sources of medical evidence. Such\\nsources are to be contacted given the need for the medical documentation to\\nreflect all available sources, particularly  where the severity of a mental\\nimpairment is questi onable or the RFC inconclusive.  An adjudicator should\\nrecontact sources whose notes or reports are incomplete, and every  reasona ble\\neffort should be made to obtain all necessary  medical evidence from the\\ntreating  sources bearing  on severity  and RFC before consultative evidence is\\nobtained  from any other source.  It is where treating  sources cannot provide\\nessential information that consultative examinations may resolve the\\nimpairment or RF C issue.\\n11.The ALJ erred in failing  to address the claimant’s pre-hearing  requests for a\\nsubpoena [or any  other requests]  as required by  HAL LEX I -2-6-52(E).\\nApplicable law:  The ALJ is required to “rule on-the-record regarding  any\\npre-hearing  requests or motions of the claimant or representative, i.e., requests\\nfor postponement (20 CFR 404.936 and 416.1436), disqualification of the\\nALJ (20 CFR 404.940 and 416.1440) and subpoenas (20 CFR 404.950( d) and\\n416.1450(d)).” HAL LEX I -2-6-52(E).\\n12.The ALJ did not fairly  and fully  develop the record in not referencing  the\\npost-hearing  evidence in the decis ion and in dismissing  the claimant’s\\nexplanation for why the new evidence was not submitted within the timeframe\\ninitially  specified at the hearing .\\n13.The ALJ erred in failing to even mention medical evidence submitted post-\\nhearing  but before the decision was issued.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§  404.935(b), 416.1536(b) provides that if the\\nclaimant has evidence but has missed the deadline for submissio n, the ALJ\\n“will accept the evidence if he or she has not yet issued a decision and you did\\nnot inform us about or submit the evidence before the deadline . . . .”  While\\nthe ALJ can provide reasons for not accepting  the evidence, remand  is\\nrequired if the AL J fails to address the evidence at all.  Id.     \\nHAL LEX I -2-6-78 addresses closing  the hearing  and states in part:\\nBefore closing  the hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) will\\n174\\nremind the claimant that he or she must inform the ALJ about or submit\\nall evidence known to him or her that relates to whether he or she is blind\\nor disabled.  See 20 C.F .R. 404.1512 and 416.912.\\nIf there is no additional evidence, “the ALJ will state on the record that the\\nhearing  and record are closed.”  Id.  However,\\nIf the claimant or representative has additional evidence to submit, the\\nALJ will consider whether to grant an extension of time to submit the\\nevidence using  the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation Law\\n(HAL LEX) manual I-2-7-20 A. When the ALJ determines that additional\\nevidence is needed (for example, a consultative examination or an updated\\nmedical report), the ALJ will inform the claim ant and representative (if\\nany) that the record will remain open after the hearing  to allow time to\\nsubmit or obtain the additional evidence. If the claimant and\\nrepresentative intend to submit  additional evidence, the ALJ will decide\\nhow long to leave the record open. If the ALJ intends to obtain additional\\nevidence, the ALJ will advise the claimant and the representative that,\\nbefore the ALJ issues a decision, the ALJ will give them an opportunity  to\\nexamine the evidence, provide comments,  object to the evidence, refute\\nthe evidence by submitting  other evidence, or request a supplemental\\nhearing , if necessary . For specific proffer instructions, see HAL LEX I-2-\\n7-1. The claimant or representative may knowing ly and voluntarily  waive\\nthe right to examine the evidence. If they knowing ly and voluntarily  waive\\nthis rig ht, the AL J will indicate such waiver on the record.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-20(B ) provides that while an ALJ may generally  decline to\\nconsider or obtain evidence that a claimant did not inform the SSA about or\\nsubmit at least five business days before the scheduled hearing , “[w]hen a\\nclaimant or appointed representative misses the five-day  deadline and requests\\nadditional time to submit evidence after the hearing , the ALJ generally  will\\nevaluate whether the circumstances in 20 C.F.R. 404.935(b) and 416.1435(b)\\napply  using  the procedures in HAL LEX I -2-6-59.”\\nIf the ALJ grants a claimant’s or representative’s reque st for additional time\\nto submit evidence after the hearing , the AL J will:\\n•Set a time limit for submitting  the evidence; and\\n•Inform the claimant and appointed representative (if any) that if the\\nALJ does not receive the evidence within the set time limit, the ALJ\\nwill issue a decision without considering the evidence (absent a\\nshowing  that the circumstances in 20 C.F.R. 404.935(b) and\\n416.1435(b) apply ).     \\n   \\nIn cases where there are multiple partie s to the hearing , and the evidence is\\nsubmitted by one party , “all other parties to the hearing  have the right to\\nreview the evidence.

See HAL LEX I -2-7-1.”46 Id.\\n14.The AL J did not develop the record in accordance with SSR 17-4p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-4p clarifies SSA’s respon sibilities to develop\\nevidence and other information, and reiterates that “the administration need[ s]\\ncomplete evidentiary  records to make accurate, consistent disability\\ndeterminations and decisions[ .]” While claimants and their representatives\\nhave the primary  responsibility  to provide evidence, the Ruling  recog nizes\\nthat the Social Security  Act requires the administration to consider all\\navailable evidence,  develop a complete medical history  of at least the\\npreceding  twelve months, and “make every  reasonable effort to obtain from\\nthe individual’s treating  physician (or other treating  health care provider) all\\nmedica l evidence, including  diagnostic tests, necessary  in order to properly\\nmake such determina tion, prior to evaluating  medical evidence obtained from\\nany other source on a consultative basis.” 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(5)(B ),\\n1382c(a)(3)(H)(i).  \\nFurther, a claimant has “info rmed” the SSA about evidence that it will then\\nrequest, when the claimant provides, at least five business days before the\\nhearing , “information specific enoug h to identify  the evidence (source,\\nlocation, and dates of treatment) and show that the evidence relates to the\\nindividual’s medical condition, work activity , job history , medical treatment,\\nor other issues relevant to whether or not the individual is disabled or blind.”\\nRuling 17-4p. If the SSA is not so informed, it will still assist in obtaining  the\\nevidence if one of the circumstances listed in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.935(b)  or\\n416.1535(b) applies.\\nThe Ruling  defines “every  reasonable effort ” as the SSA making  “an initial\\nrequest for evidence  from the medical source or entity  that maintains the\\nmedical evidence, and, at any time between 10 and 20 calendar  days after the\\ninitial request, if the evidence has not been received, we will make a follow-\\nup request to obtain the medical evidence necessary  to make a determination.”\\nId. Nevertheless, the SSA  “will first ask the individual or representative to\\nsubmit the evidence. However, if the individual or representative  shows that\\nhe or she is unable to obtai n the evidence despite good faith efforts or for\\nreasons beyond his or her control, we may request the evidence directly from\\nthe medical source or entity  that maintains the evidence.” Id.\\nB.SUBMISSIO N OF EVIDENCE - THE FIVE-DAY RUL E\\n1.The ALJ committed harmful error by not accepting  *** evidence that was\\nsubmitted [less than five business days prior to the hearing/after the hearing ]\\nbecause the claimant informed the ALJ about the evide nce at least five\\nbusiness day s before the hearing .\\n46 HAL LEX I -2-7-1 Post-hearing Evidence – Whe n Proffer Is Required is discussed at page 180, infra.\\n176\\n2.The AL J erred in not accepting  evidence from Dr.*** which was submitted\\nless than five business day s prior to the hearing , as the claimant actively  and\\ndilig ently  soug ht this evidence timely , but due to circumstances bey ond\\nhis/her control, the evidence was not timely  received.\\nApplicable law.

In relation\\nto the submission of evidence, a claimant has an ongoing duty to inform SSA\\n“about or submit all evidence known to you that relates to whether or not you\\nare blind or disabled,” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(a)(1), 416.912(a)(1) (emphasis\\nadded), while certain privileg ed communications  are not considered evidence. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1513(b), 415.913(b).  The oblig ation to submit evidence, or\\ninform the SSA of evidence, “applies at each level of the administrative\\nreview process, including  the Appeals Council level if the evidence relates to\\nthe period on or before the date of the [ALJ] hearing  decision.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1512(a)(1), 416.912(a)(1).\\nEvery  effort must be made to ensure the ALJ receives all evidence and, as\\nnow required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512, 416.9 12, SSA mandates that\\nclaimants “inform us about or submit any written evidence  . . . no later than 5\\nbusiness days before the date of the scheduled hearing .”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.935(a), 416.1435(a) (Emphasis added).  Lack of compliance may result in\\nan ALJ’s refusal to consider the evidence unless certain circumstances apply . \\nId.  Excusing  circumstances are that\\n(1)Our action misled y ou;\\n(2)You had a physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation(s) that\\nprevented you from informing  us about or submitting  the evidence earlier;\\nor\\n(3)Some other unusual, unex pected, or unavoidable circums tance beyond\\nyour control prevented you from informing  us about or submitting  the\\nevidence earlier. Ex amples include, but are not limited to:\\n  (i)You were seriously ill, and your illness prevented you from\\ncontacting  us in person, in writing , or throug h a friend, relative, or\\nother person;\\n(ii)There was a death or serious illness in y our immediate family ;\\n(iii) I mportant records were destroy ed or damag ed by  fire or other\\n177\\n accidental cause; or\\n(iv)You actively  and dilig ently soug ht evidence from a source and the\\nevidence w3.as not received or was received less than 5 business\\ndays prior to the hearing .\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.935(b), 416.1435(b).  \\nSSR 17-4p addresses the substance of a claimant’s disclosure, stating  that it\\nmust be “specific enoug h to identify  the evidence (source, location, and dates\\nof treatment) and show that the evidence  relates to the individual’s medical\\ncondition, work activity , job history , medical treatmen t, or other issues\\nrelevant to whether or not the individual is disabled or blind.”  If the requisite\\nspecificity  is not provided, SSA has not been “informed” within the meaning\\nof the reg ulations. \\nSSR 17-4p describes a representative’s duty  to submit evidence as derivative\\nof the claimant’s, but overlain by SSA’s rules of conduct and standards of\\nresponsibility .  Thos e rules impose affirmative duties on a representative to:\\n(1) “act with reasonable promptness to help  obtain the information or\\nevidence that the claimant must submit and forward the information or\\nevidence” as soon as practicable ; and (2) “assist a claimant in comply ing, as\\nsoon as practicable, with our requests for information or evidence.”  \\nSSR 17-4p states that a representative must provide competent assistance to\\nthe claimant and refrain from actions or behavior prejudicial to the fair and\\norderly  conduct of administrative proceeding s.  Failure to comply  risks\\ndisciplinary  action.  Nor is it ordinarily  sufficient for a representative to\\ninform SSA about evidence without first attempting  to obtain it as SSR 17-4p\\ncautions:\\nIn addition, it is only  acceptable for a representative to inform us about\\nevidence without submitting  it if the representative shows that, despit e\\ngood faith efforts, he or she could not obtain the evidence.  Simply\\ninforming  us of the existence of evidence without providing  it or waiting\\nuntil 5 days before a hearing  to inform us about or provide evidence when\\nit was otherwise available, may cause unreason able delay  to the\\nprocessing  of the claim, without good cause,  and may be prejudicial to the\\nfair and orderly conduct of our administrative proceeding s.  As such, this\\nbehavior could be found to violate our rules of conduct and could lead to\\nsanction proceeding s against the representative.\\nSSR 17-4p concedes that a representative’s violation “does not chang e\\n[SSA’s]  duties with respect to the development of the evidence.”   \\nSSR 17-4p also states that claimant’s duty  to submit or inform SSA about all\\nevidence known to him or her that relates to disability /blindness is ongoing\\nand requires disclosure of any additional evidence about which the claimant\\n178\\nbecomes aware.  Moreover, the duty applies at each level of the administrative\\nreview process but does not extend to evidence unrelated to the period on or\\nbefore the AL J’s decision.  \\n  \\nSSR 17-4p acknowledg es that the determination of whether evidence must be\\ndisclosed as related to a claim is a matter of judgment.  However, it imposes\\nan expectation that individuals will “exercise their reasonable good faith\\njudgment” in making  this determination.  This Ruling  notes that potentiall y\\nrelevant evidence “includes objective medical evidence , medical opinion\\nevidence, other medical evidence, and evidence from nonmedical sources.” \\nHALLEX I-2-6-52(E) addresses the policies where the “claimant or\\nrepresentative states during  the hearing  that there are outstanding  records to\\nsubmit.”  I n this circumstance:\\nthe ALJ will remind him or her of the duty to submit to the ALJ, no later\\nthan five business days before the scheduled hearing , all written evidence\\nknown to the claimant or any representative that relates to whether the\\nclaimant is blind or disabled (see 20 CFR  404.1512, 404.1740(b),\\n416.912(c), and 416.1540(b)).  An ALJ may declin e to admit evidence not\\ntimely  submitt ed, except under limited circumstances (see 20 CFR\\n404.935(b) and 416.1435(b); and HAL LEX I-2-6-59B ).  If an ALJ does\\nnot find that one of the limited circumstances applies, the ALJ will explain\\nin the decision why he or she did not consider the evidence, in accordance\\nwith HAL LEX I-2-6-59C. \\nNOTE:  Evidence generally  does not include a representative’s analy sis of\\nthe claim or oral or written communications  between a claimant and his or\\nher representa tive.  Whether or not a representative is an attorney  or non-\\nattorney , these communications would be subject to the attorney -clien t\\nprivileg e under our regulations.  See 20 CFR 404.1513(b) and 416.913(b).  \\n3.The ALJ erred by not obtaining  medical evidence despite being timely\\nadvised of the names and addresses of providers who had evidence  relevant to\\nthis claim.\\nApplicable law:  In 2015, the Comm issioner modified the regulations that\\ndefine the duty to submit evidence.  The regulations previ ously stated that the\\nclaimant “must furnish medical and other evidence” to prove disability , and\\nthat SSA will help the claimant get reports from the claimant’‘ medi cal\\nsources.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(a ), (d) (2014). But in 2015, the Commissioner\\namended these regulations to state that the claimant “must inform us about or\\nsubmit” evidence relating  to disability  during  the period on or before the date\\nof the administrative law judge hearing  decision.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(a)\\n(2017).\\nIn comments explaining  the chang es in the Regulation s, the Commissioner\\n179\\nstated that the claimant’s duty is to provide the names and addresses of\\nmedical sources, and that “we will then obtain the records from those\\nsources.”   80 Fed. Reg. 14828, 14834 (Mar. 20, 2015).  Under the 2015\\nRegulations, the ALJ has a duty to obtain records the claimant has\\ninformed SSA about.  Since the Commissioner has assumed responsi bility\\nfor obtaining  all information the claimant informs SSA about, and has\\nstated that the duty covers the entire period throug h the ALJ decision, the\\nALJ erred in not obtaining  all treatment records.\\n4.The ALJ erred in failing  to even mention medical evidence submitte d post-\\nhearing  but before the decision was issued.\\nApplicable law:  20 C.F.R. §§  404.935(b), 416.15 36(b) provides that if the\\nclaimant has evidence but has misse d the deadline for submission, the ALJ\\n“will accept the evidence if he or she has not yet issued a decision and you did\\nnot inform us about or submit the evidence before the deadline . . . .”  While\\nthe ALJ can provide reasons for not accepting  the evidence, remand is\\nrequired if the AL J fails to address the evidence at all.  Id.    \\n \\nC. CLAIMANT’S RIG HT TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE\\n1.The ALJ did not tender the post-hearing  evidence to the claimant as required\\nby HAL LEX I -2-7-1 and I -2-5-28(f).\\n \\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-7-1 provides that an ALJ will proffer to the\\nclaimant and appointed representative, if any, additional evide nce received\\nafter the hearing from a source other than the claimant or the appointed\\nrepresentative.  Concerning  interrog atory  responses from a medical or\\nvocational expert, proffer is required even if the interrog atory  responses were\\nobtained pre-hearing .\\nHowever, the ALJ is not required to proffer the evidence when the evidence\\nwas submitted by the claimant and there is no other party  to the hearing , when\\nthe claimant has knowing ly waived his/her right to examine the evidence, or\\nthe ALJ issues a fully  favorable decision. Id.  Proffering allows a claimant to\\n“[c]omment on, object to, or refute the evidence by  submitting  other evidence;\\nor “[i]f required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, cross-ex amine the\\nauthor(s) of the evidence.”  \\nHAL LEX I-2-5-28(F ) requires the ALJ disclose evidence obtained after the\\nhearing  from a source other than the claimant or representative:\\nIf an ALJ receives new evidence after the hearing  from a source other than\\nthe claimant or representative, if any, and the ALJ proposes to enter the\\nevidence into the record as an exhibit, the ALJ will follow the proffer\\n180\\nprocedures in HAL LEX I-2-7-1, I-2-7-30, and I-2-7-35.47 See HAL LEX I-\\n2-5-91-92, and I -2-6-99.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-30 addresses proffer proce dures. HALLEX I-2-7-30(A)\\nprovides that the proffer letter to the claimant and appointed representat ive, if\\nany, must include the following  information:\\n•A time limit to object to, comment on, or refute the proffered\\nevidence, and to submit a written statement as to the facts and law that\\nthe claimant believes apply  to the case in light of the evidence\\nsubmitted;\\n•A time limit to submit written questions to the author(s) of the\\nproffered evidence;\\n•An oppor tunity to exercise his or her right to request a supplemental\\nhearing , including  the opportunity  to cross-ex amine the author(s) of\\nany post-hearing  evidence; and\\n•The opportunity  and instructions for requesting  a subpoena for the\\nattendance of witnesses or the submission of records.\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-30(B ) addresses sending  the proffer letter and states:\\nIf a claimant is represented, [hearing  office (“HO”)]  staff will send the\\nproffer letter to the appointed repre sentative, with a copy  of the proffer\\nletter to the claimant.  HO staff will also include a copy  of the new\\nevidence if the representative does not have online access to the claim(s)\\nfile throug h the Appointed Repre sentative Services portal or when the\\nclaim(s) file is paper.\\nIf a claimant is unrepresented,  HO staff will usually  prepare a proffer\\nletter to the claimant (modify ing the letter as necessary ) and send the\\noriginal proffer letter and a copy  of the new evidence to the claimant.\\nHowever, if the additional evidence contains information that may be\\ndetrimental to the claimant’s health, the AL J will proffer as follows:\\nIf the claimant is represented, the ALJ will send a modified proffer\\nletter and a copy  of the evidence only  to the representative. In the\\nmodified letter, the ALJ will recommend that the representative not\\nshare the evidence with the claimant due to a possible detrimen tal\\nimpact on the claimant’s health and that the representative discuss the\\nevidence with the claimant only  in g eneral terms.\\nIf the claimant is unrepresented, the ALJ will give the claimant the\\n47 HAL LEX I -2-7-35 is discussed at page185, infra.\\n181\\nopportunity  to examine the evide nce in the HO or, if more convenient\\nto the claimant, in the servicing  field offic e (FO).  See HAL LEX I-2-7-\\n30 C below for instructions on proffering  throug h the FO. Althoug h\\nthe claimant has a right to examine the evidence, any HO staff\\ninvolved with presentation of the evidence to the claimant will make\\nall reasonable efforts to ensure that a relative or friend accompanies\\nthe claimant.\\nThe proffer can also be made by the field office (“FO”) in “unusual\\ncircu mstances, such as when evidence may be detrimental to the\\nclaimant’s health and the claimant is unrepresented, or when the claimant\\nwould be required to travel a significant distance to the [hearing  office]\\nbut lives near an F O . . . .”  HAL LEX I -2-7-30(C).  I n such circumstances:\\nThe ALJ will send a letter to the claimant advising  him or her of the\\nprocedure.  See HAL LEX I-2-7-93 for a sample letter.  The letter will\\nadvise the claimant of the following : \\n•The rig ht to ex amine and comment on the evidence; \\n•The rig ht to submit additional evidence or refute the new evidence;\\n•The right to ask the ALJ to send the evidence to the claimant’s\\ntreating  physician for comments;\\n•The right to request a  supplemental hearing  (if applicable under\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-1);\\n•The right to request the opportunity  to question the author of any\\npost-hearing  report;\\n•A statement that the FO will not be able to discuss the material\\nbecause the case is before the AL J; and\\n•A statement that the FO will provide the claimant a 10- day\\ntimeframe to ex amine the evidence.\\nBecause the ALJ is not sending  the additional evidence to the claimant in\\nthis situation, HO staff will prepare a list of the additional evidence to\\naccompany  the letter.  F or a sample list, see HALLEX I-2-7-94.48\\nAdditionally , regardless of whether the claim(s) file is electronic or paper,\\nHO staff will send a memorandum to the FO, asking  the FO to assist in\\narrang ing a 10-day  timeframe for the claimant to examine the additional\\nevidence.  For sample memorandum language, see HAL LEX I-2-7-95.49 \\n48 HAL LEX I -2-7-94, Sa mple - List of Addi tional Evidence.\\n49 HAL LEX I -2-7-95, Sa mple - Memorandum  to Field Of fice with Co py of Post-hearing Evidence\\n182\\nWith the memorandum, HO staff will send the following : \\n•A copy  of the AL J’s letter to the claimant;\\n•A list of additional evidence;\\n•A copy  of the proffered evidence; and\\n•An attachment to document that the claimant has reviewed the\\nevidence ( see HAL LEX I -2-7-96).50\\n2.The AL J erred in not addressing  the claimant’s comments reg arding  the post-\\nhearing  evidence in the hearing  decision.\\n3.The AL J erred in not ruling  on the claimant’s objections to the proffered\\nevidence.\\n4.The ALJ erred in not scheduling  a supplemental hearing  requested by the\\nclaimant.\\n5.The ALJ erred in not providing  any reasons for his/her rejection of the\\nclaimant’s rig ht to question the post-hearing  CE at a supplemental hearing . \\nApplicable law:  The ALJ is required to address any comments received in\\nthe “rationale of the written decision.”  HALLEX I-2-7-30(C )(2).  “If the\\nclaimant objects to the proffered evidence, the ALJ will make a formal ruling ,\\neither in the decision or by separate order.” Id.  If it is done by separate order,\\nthe ALJ must provide a copy  to the claimant and appointed  representative and\\nadd the order to the record.  Id.\\nHAL LEX I-2-7-30(C)(1) addresses the circumstances when  the claimant\\nrequests additional time, a supplemental hearing , or the opportunity  to\\nquestion the author of the evidence:\\nIf, in response to a proffer of evidence, a claimant requests additional time\\nto submit comments, the ALJ will use the procedures in HAL LEX I-2-7-\\n20.  If the ALJ offered the opportunity  for a supplemental hearing  with\\nproffered evidence and the claimant reque sts a supplemental hearing , the\\nALJ must grant the request unless the ALJ has already  decided to issue a\\nfully  favorable decision.  The ALJ must grant the reque st even if the\\nopportunity  for a supplemental hearing  was offered by mistake.  If the\\nclaimant requests a supplemental hearing  when the ALJ appropriately  did\\nnot offer the opportunity, the ALJ has discretion to determine whether to\\ngrant the request.  When the ALJ determines a supplemental  hearing is not\\nnecessary, he or she will respond to the claimant in writing  and associate\\nthe writing  with the claim(s) file as an exhibit.  (If it does not cause\\n50 HAL LEX I -2-7-96, Sa mple - Exa mination of Evidence.\\n183\\nunreasonable delay  and is appropriate based on the circumstances, the\\nALJ may  address the issue in his or her decision rather than in a). \\nIf the claimant asks to question a medical or vocational expert who has\\nresponded to interrog atorie s, the ALJ will use the procedures in HAL LEX\\nI-2-5-4451 or I-2-5-58,52 as applicable. If the claimant requests an\\nopportunity  to question any other author(s) of post-hearing  evidence, the\\nALJ will evaluate whether questioning  the autho r is necessary  to inquire\\nfully into the matters at issue.  If it is necessary , the ALJ will determi ne\\nwhether to conduct the questionin g throug h live testimony  or written\\ninterrog atories.  Generally , an ALJ will not use interrog atories when there\\nmay be difficulty  anticipating  the questions that will arise.\\nNOTE 1:\\nIf the ALJ asks the author to appear for questioning  and the author\\ndeclines to appear voluntarily , see HAL LEX I -2-5-78.\\nNOTE 2:\\nIf the ALJ requests information from a Disability  Determination Services\\n(DDS) staff physician, consultat ive examiner, or DDS or FO personnel,\\nHO staff will use an “assistance request. ”  For more information on other\\ncomponent responsibilities on receipt of an assistanc e request, see\\ngenerally  Prog ram Operations Manual Sy stem (POMS) DI  29501.\\n6.The ALJ was required to schedule a supplemental hearing  as required by the\\nHAL LEX and providing the claimant with the opportunity  to cross-ex amine\\nthe medical ex pert who submitted a post-hearing  report.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-7-1 addresses  post-hearing  evidence\\nwhenever a proffer is required and provides that an ALJ will proffer to the\\nclaimant and appoin ted representative, if any, additional evidence received\\nafter the hearing  from a source other than the claimant or the appointed\\nrepresentative.  Concerning  interrog atory  responses from a medical  or\\nvocational expert, proffer is required even if the interrog atory  respons es were\\nobtained pre-hearing .  However, the ALJ is not required to proffer the\\nevidence when the evidence was submitted by the claimant and there is no\\nother party  to the hearing , when the claim ant has knowing ly waived his/her\\nright to examine the evidence, or the ALJ issues a fully favorable decision. Id. \\nHAL LEX I -2-7-1 further states:\\nWhen an administrative law judge (ALJ) receives additional eviden ce\\nafter the hearing  from a source other than the claimant or the appoin ted\\nrepresentative, if any, and the ALJ proposes to admit the evidence into the\\nrecord, he or she will proffer the evidence to the claiman t and appointed\\n51 HAL LEX I -2-5-44 is discussed at pages 185- 86, infra.\"\n",

HAL LEX I-3-2-17(B ) addresses the\\nactions the Appeals Council take when the ALJ did not proffer evidence and\\nstates:\\nUnless the ALJ issued a fully  favorable decisio n (see HAL LEX I-2-7-1 B)\\nor the claimant waived the right to examine posthearing  evidence and the\\nopportunity  to request a supplemental hearing  (see HAL LEX I-2-7-15),\\nthe AC will grant review and take appropriate corrective action if an ALJ\\ndid not proffer:\\n• A consultative ex amination report received after the hearing ;\\n• Responses to interrog atories sent to a medi cal or vocational expert\\n(even if the responses were obtained prehearing , see HALLEX I-2-\\n5-29 B ); or\\n•Other opinion evidence recei ved after the hearing , unless the\\nevidence is submitted by the claimant or the appointed\\nrepresentative and there is no other party  to the hearing  (see\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-1 B ).\\nWhen an ALJ admitted evidence other than the types specifically  listed\\nabove into the record but did not proffer that evidence, the AC will\\nconsider  the facts of the case and the evidence at issue in determining\\nwhether to take corrective action.\\nNOTE: If it is unclear who submitted evidence  after the hearing  and\\nwhether the claimant had the opportunity  to review that evidence, the AC\\nwill generally assume the ALJ should have proffered the evidence and\\nwill evaluate whether to take corrective action.\\nHALLEX I-3-2-17(C) address the action the Appeals Council takes when\\nan ALJ proffered evidence but did not offer a supplemental hearing  and\\nstates:\\n[I]f the ALJ did not offer a supplemental hearing  and there is a\\nlegitimate concern about whet her a supplemental hearing  was\\nnecessary  to protect a claimant ’s due process rights, the AC may\\ndecide to grant review.”  Additionally , the ALJ must grant a\\n190\\nclaimant’s request for a supplemental hearing  if the ALJ offered a\\nsupplemental hearing when proffering  the evidence, even if the ALJ\\noffered the supplemental hearing  in error. See HALLEX I-2-7-1C.\\nHowever, if a claimant requests a supplemental hearing  when the ALJ\\ndid not offer one and the ALJ was not required to offer one, the ALJ\\nhas discretion on whether to grant the claimant’s request. See\\nHAL LEX I -2-7-1.\\nD. RIGHT TO A HEARING59\\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with the Social Security  Act as well as the \\nCommissioner’s own policies in not scheduling  a hearing  in this case,\\nresulting  in prejudice to the claimant.\\n2.Even thoug h the claimant waived his/her right to a hearing , the ALJ failed  to\\ncomply  with HAL LEX I-2-1-82 in not tendering  post-hearing  evidence as\\nrequired.  \\nApplicable law:  The Soci al Security  Act provides that “the  Commissioner\\nshall give such applicant and such other individual reasonable notice and\\nopportun ity for a hearing  with respect to” any decision involving  a\\n“determination of disability  and which is in whole or in part unfavora ble to\\nsuch individual shall contain a statement of the case, in understandable\\nlanguage, setting  forth the discussion of the evidence, and stating  the\\nCommissioner’s determination and the reason or reasons upon which it is\\nbased.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(b)(1).\\nThe regulations provide that a claimant may waive the right to appear at\\nhis/her hearing  by sending  “the administrative law judge a waiver or a written\\nstatement indicating  that you do not wish to appear at the hearing .”  20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.950(b), 416.1450(b).  The regulations further provide that the claimant\\n“may  withdraw this waiver any time before a notice of the hearing  decision is\\nmailed.”  Id.  However, even in cases where a claimant waives his or her right\\nto appear at a hearing , the ALJ may schedule a hearing  if the ALJ believes\\nthat a “personal appear ance and testimony  by you or any other party  is\\nnecessary  to decide the case.” Id.\\nSocial Security  Ruling  79-19:\\nrequires that a claimant be given a thoroug h explanation of the hearing\\nproce dure, the claimant’s right to personally  appear and present evidence,\\nthe claimant’s right to representation, the value of a personal appearance\\nand the fact that absent a personal appearance the claim will be decided\\nsolely  on the written evidence on file\\n59This section addresses the recent regulatory amendments addressing the manner of setting the appearance\\nof parties and w itnesses at a hearing.\\n191\\nId.  The rationale behind this Ruling is a recog nition of the importance of the\\nhearing  appearance rights of claimants and voices a concern that a waiver of\\nthe right to appear be voluntary , based on a full understanding  of the\\nconsequences of such a decision.  Id.\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-82 addresses the waiver of the right to appear at the hearing\\nand states:\\nA claimant may waive the right to appear at a hearing  and request that an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) decide the case based on the evidence of\\nrecord. A waiver of the right to appear at a hearing must be in writing  and\\nsigned by the claimant. Any waiver must be made voluntari ly and\\nknowing ly, as defined in Social Security  Ruling  79-19: Titles II, XVI and\\nXVIII: Waiver of Personal Appearance at a Hearing .\\nWhile useful in assessing  the claimant’s intent, the checkbox  in question\\nsix in form HA-501-U5 “Request for Hearing  by Administrative Law\\nJudge” that states, “I do not wish to appear at a hearing  and I request that a\\ndecision be made based on the evidence in my case.  (Complete Waiver\\nForm HA-4608)” is not sufficient to show that the claimant “knowing ly”\\nsubmitted a waiver.\\n An ALJ may sched ule a hearing even when a claimant waives his or her\\nright to an appearance at a hearing , if the ALJ believes a personal\\nappearance and testimony  from the claimant are necessa ry to decide the\\ncase.  See 20 CFR 404.950(b) and 416.1450(b) , and Hearing s, Appeals\\nand L itigation L aw (HAL LEX) manual I -2-6-1.\\nNOTE:  If an ALJ schedules a hearing despite a claimant’s waiver, the\\nALJ will consider all evidence as required by 20 CFR 404.1512 and\\n416.912 that is received no later than five business days before the date of\\nthe hearing  (see 20 CF R 404.935 and 416.1435).\\nThis HAL LEX further directs that if a “claimant mark s the checkbox  in\\nquestion six in the request for hearing  or states in another writing  that he or\\nshe waives the right to appear at a hearing , hearing  office (HO) staff will\\nobtain written documentation from the claimant” which can be on form HA-\\n4608 “Waiver of Your Right to Personal Appear ance Before an\\nAdministrative Law Judge.”  Id.  This form, along  with “any correspondence\\nin the claim(s) file to help establish that the claimant subm itted the waiver\\nvoluntarily  and knowing ly” will be added to the record.  However, “form HA-\\n4608 is not required for a claimant to waive his or her right to appear  at a\\nhearing ” as it is “acceptable if the claimant elects to respond in a different\\nsigned writing  that provides the same information.”  Id.  Also, written\\ndocumentation is not required “if it was provided during  a pre-hearing\\n192\\nconference, because the recording  from the conference is part of the record.”60 \\nId. (citing  HAL LEX I -2-1-75 D).\\n \\nThe HAL LEX further provides that generally , a claimant still has a right to\\nsubmit written commentor respond to interrog atories or other evidence even\\nin those case where he or she waived his or her right ‘o a hearing  unless the\\nfollowing  conditions are met which do not require proffering  of evidence:    \\nE. Proffering  Evidence\\n1. Post-hearing Evidence\\nIf an ALJ schedules and holds a hearing  despite the claimant’s waiver of\\nthe right to appe ar at a hearing , the ALJ must proffer evidence received\\nafter a hearing, unless the claimant also waived the right to examine the\\nevidence or to appear at a supplemental hearing .  See subsection B above\\nand HAL LEX I -2-7-1, I -2-7-15, and I -2-7-30.\\n2.Vocational Expert and/or Medical Expert Testimony\\nIf an ALJ schedules and holds a hearing  despite a waiver, the ALJ may\\nneed to proffer testimony  received from a vocational expert and/or\\nmedical expert(s) at the hearing , depe nding on whether the claimant had\\nnotice of the expert testimony  prior to waiving  his or her right to appear at\\nthe hearing .\\nIf the claimant waived his or her right to appear at the hearing  after\\nreceiving  a notice of hearing  informing  him or her that a vocational expert\\nand/or medic al expert(s) is scheduled to appear, the ALJ will not need to\\nproffer testimony  received from such expert(s) noticed to appear.  See\\nsubsection B  above.\\nIf the claimant waived the right to appear at the hearing  before receiving\\nnotice that a vocational expert and/or medical expert(s) is scheduled to\\nappear, and the claimant was not subsequently  informed of such potential\\nexpert testimo ny pursuant to subsection B above, the ALJ must proffer the\\ntestimony  by such expert(s), followi ng the procedures in E.1 above. \\nHowever, if the claimant reaffir med his or her waiver to appear after\\nreceiving  notice of such expert(s) scheduled appearance, the ALJ will not\\nneed to proffer testimony  from such ex pert(s).\\n60 HAL LEX I -2-1-82 addre sses pre-hearing conferences and st ates:\\nPre-hearing Conference (PHC)  and Pr e-hearing Development Contacts (PHDC)\\n \\nEven if a claimant waives his or her right to appear at a hearing, an ALJ or an authorized designee may\\nschedule a PHC, when necessary, to narrow and clarify issues.  See HAL LEX I-2-1-75. HO staff may also\\ncontact an unr epresented claimant prior to a hearing through a PHDC.  Se e HAL LEX I -2-1-80 A.2.\\n193\\nId. (citing 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.929, 404.935, 416.1429, and 416.1435; and\\nHAL LEX I -2-5-29).\\n    \\nHAL LEX I-2-1-82 also provides that the ALJ can conduct the hearing  despite\\nthe waiver:\\nIf an ALJ schedules a hearing  desp ite a claimant’s waiver of the right to a\\nhearing , the ALJ will issue a detailed notice of hearing  to specify  the facts\\nand issues that require developmen t at a hearing . If the ALJ holds the\\nhearing , despite the waiver, and neither the claimant nor any appointed\\nreprese ntative appear, the ALJ may not dismiss the request for hearing . \\nSee HAL LEX I-2-4-25 F. Rather, an ALJ must  decide the case based on\\nthe evidence of record.  An AL J will ex plain in the decision:\\n• The reason for requesting  the claimant’s appearance and the AL J’s\\nefforts to put the claimant on notice of the need for the hearing ;\\nand\\n•Any adver se presumptions regarding  the weig ht of the evidence\\nthat arose from the claimant’s refusal to appear.\\n \\nNOTE:  If circumstances suggest that a representative routinely  advises his or\\nher clients to waive the right to appear at a hearing  or to ignore scheduled\\nhearing  despite the waiver, an ALJ will consider whether it would be\\nappropriate to submit a referral to the Office of the General Counsel under\\nHAL LEX I -1-1-50 for possible representative misconduct.\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with HAL LEX I-2-4-25 in dismissing  the request for\\nhearing  because the claimant did not appear at the hearing .\\n4.The ALJ committed reversible error and violated claimant’s due process right\\nto a fundamentally  fair hearing  by proceeding  without claiman t’s presence\\nand testimony  at his/her hearing without properly  following  the procedures\\ndictate d by HAL LEX I-2-4-25(D)(2) even thoug h his/her representative was\\npresent.\\n   5.The ALJ did not comply with the procedures set forth  in HALLEX I-2-4-\\n25(D)(2) in not sending  the Request to Show Cause for Failure to Appear and\\naffording  the claimant the opportunity  to explain the reasons for the failure to\\nappear.\\nApplicable law :  HAL LEX I -2-4-25(D)(2) provides:\\nIf an appointe d representative appears at the scheduled hearing  without the\\nclaimant and continues to represent the claima nt during  the hearing ,\\ndismissal is never appropriate. However, the ALJ may determine that the\\nclaimant has constructively  waived the rig ht to appear at the hearing  if:\\n194\\n•the representative is unable to locate the claimant,\\n•the Notice of Hearing  was mailed to the claimant’s last known\\naddress, and \\n•the contact procedures required by 20 C.F.R. 404.938 and 416.1438,\\nas described in HAL LEX I -2-3-20, have been followed.\\nIf the ALJ finds that the claimant has constructively  waived the right to\\nappear at the hearing , the ALJ need not proceed with the hearing  and may\\nchoose to issue a decision on the record.   However, if medical expert or\\nvocational expert testimony  is needed to resolve the case, the ALJ may choo se\\nto proceed with the hearing , accepting  the testim ony of the witness(es) and\\nallowing  the appointed representative to question the witness(es) and make\\narguments on the claimant’s behalf.\\nIn any event, the ALJ will advise the appointed repres entative, either on the\\nrecord during  the hearing  or in writing  thereafter, that he or she will not send a\\nRequest to Show Cause for Failure to Appear to the claimant because the\\nclaimant has constructively  waived the right to appear at a hearing . When\\ndone in writing , the AL J must associate the writing  with the record.\\nIf the ALJ finds that the claimant has not construc tively waived the right to\\nappear at the hearing , the ALJ may choose to proceed with the hearing,\\naccepting  the testimony  of the witness(es) and allowing  the appointed\\nrepresentative to quest ion the witness(es) and make arguments on the\\nclaimant’s behalf. The ALJ will advise the appointed representative that a\\nRequest to Show Cause for Failure to Appear will be sent to the claimant to\\nask why he or she did not appear at the scheduled hearing  and whether a\\nsupplemental hearing  should be held. After the 10-day  response period\\nexpires (with an additional five day s for mailing  time), the AL J will either:\\n•Determine that the claimant has constructively  waived his or her right\\nto appear for a hearing (if the claimant fails to respond to the Request\\nto Show Cause for Failure to Appear or fails to show good cause for\\nfailure to appear at the scheduled hearing ), and issue a decision based\\non the evidence of record; or\\n•Offer the claimant a supplemental hearing  to provide testimony  if the\\nclaimant establishes good cause for failure to appear at the scheduled\\nhearing .\\n6.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the claimant’s representative to question\\nwitnesses [ or inadequate time to question witnesses]  at the hearing .\\nApplicable law:  The regulation s unequivocally  provide that at the hearing\\nthe ALJ “may ask the witnesses any questions material to the issues and will\\n195\\nallow the parties or their desig nated repre sentatives to do so.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.950(e), 416.1540(e) (emphasis added). Permitting  the parties to do so is\\nthus not a matter of discretion. \\n7.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the witness to testify by [telephone or by\\nvideoconferencing ] as the witness was unable to testify  in person.\\n8.The ALJ erred in not calling  a witness (including  a medical or vocational\\nexpert) to appear for hearing  in person because telephone or video\\nteleconferencing  equipment was not available to conduct the appearance; or\\nuse of telephone or video teleconferencing  equipment would be less efficient\\nthan conducting  the appearance in person; or there are facts that provide a\\ngood reason to schedule this individual’s appearance in person.\\nApplic able law: The regulations at 20 C.F.R. § 404.950(e) provide the\\nfollowing  about witnesses: \\n(e) Witnesses at a hearing . Witnesses you call may appear at a hearing\\nwith you in the same manner in which you are scheduled to appear. If they\\nare unable to appear with you in the same manner as you, they may appear\\nas prescribed in § 404.936(c)( 4). Witnesses called by the administrative\\nlaw judg e will appear in the manner prescribed in § 404.936(c)(4) . They\\nwill testify  under oath or affirmation unless the administrati ve law judg e\\nfinds an important reason to excuse them from taking  an oath or\\naffirmation. \\nSee also  20 C.F .R. § 416.1450(e), applicable to SSI  claims. \\n20 C.F.R. § 404.936(c)(4) also addresses witnesses at the hearing  and\\nprovides:\\n(4) We will generally  direct any person we call as a witness, other than\\nyou or any other party  to the hearing , including  a medical expert or a\\nvocational expert, to appear by telephone or by video teleconferencing . \\nWitnesses you call will appear at the hearing pursuant to § 404.950I .  If\\nthey are unable to appear with you in the same manner as you, we will\\ngenerally  direct them to appear by video teleconferencing  or by telephone. \\nWe will consider directing  witnesses to appear in person only  when:\\n  (i)Telephone or video teleconferencing equipment is not availa ble to\\nconduct the appearance;\\n(ii)We determ ine that use of telephone or video teleconferencing\\nequip ment would be less efficient than conducting  the appearance in\\nperson; or\\n(iii) We find that there are facts in your particular case that provide a good \\n     reason to schedule this individual’s appearance in person.\\n196\\nSee also  20 C.F .R. § 416.1436(c)(4), applicable to SSI  claims. \\n  9.The ALJ erred in holding  the hearing  by video teleconferencing because the\\nclaimant timely  objected and requested an in person hearing .\\n10.Notwithstanding  that the claimant had a chan ge of residence while his/her\\nrequest for hearing  was pending , the ALJ erred in not considering  and\\ngranting claimant’s objection to holding the hearing by video\\nteleconferencing,  because claimant notified the agency and provided\\nverification of the chang e of residence before the hearing  was scheduled.\\n11.Notw ithstanding  that the claimant had a chang e of residence while his/her\\nrequest for hearing  was pending , the ALJ erred in not considering  and\\ngranting claimant’s objection to holding the hearing by video\\nteleconferencing , because g ood reason ex isted to hold the hearing  in person.\\n12.The ALJ erred in holding  the hearing  by video teleconf erencing because  there\\nwas good cause for the claimant’s untimely  objection and request for an in\\nperson hearing .\\n13.The ALJ erred in not scheduling  a hearing  by telephone, because good cause\\nexisted for claimant’s request for a telephonic hearing  since appearance by\\nvideo teleconferencing  or in person was not possible or other extraordinar y\\ncircumstances.  \\nApplicable law.  The regulations at 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.929, 416.1429 address\\nALJ hearing s and provide in pertinent part, that SSA “will schedule you to\\nappear by video teleconferencing  or in person.”61  The regulations further set\\n61 The regulations were amended, see 84 Fed. Reg. 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019)  which addressed “Setting the\\nManner for the Appe arance of Parties and Witnesses at a Hearing.”  This final rule became effective January\\n17, 2020, and modifies the time, place, and manner of appearance for hearings at the ALJ level of the\\nadministrative review process. The final rule states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing before an ALJ, and that the agency will set the time and place for the hearing accordingly. \\nParties to a hearing will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone.  Unde r this final rule, the agency will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the ability to\\nopt out of appearing by VTC at the ALJ hearings level. The revisions also provide that, at the ALJ hearing\\nlevel, if the agency needs to send an amended notice of hearing, or to schedule a supplemental hearing, the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing will be sent at least 20 days before the date of the hearing.\\nThe date of hearing indicated in the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing will be at least 75 days\\nfrom the date we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing unless the claimant has waived his or her right to\\nadvance notice.

To determine whethe r good cause exists for missing  this\\ndeadline, we use the standards ex plained in § 404.911.\\n14.The ALJ erred in not granting  the claim ant’s timely  request to chang e the time\\nor place of the hearing  because a serious physical or menta l condition or\\nincapacitating  injury  or severe weather conditions made it impossible for\\nclaimant or his/her representative to travel to the hearing .\\nApplicable law.  The regulatio ns address good cause for chang ing the time or\\nplace of a hearing  and provide: \\n  (f) Good cause for chang ing the time or place. The administrative law\\njudg e will determine whether good cause exists for changing the time or\\nplace of your scheduled hearing . If the administrative law judg e finds that\\ngood cause exists, we will set the time or place of the new hearing . A\\nfinding  that good cause exists to reschedule the time or place of your\\nhearing  will generally  not chang e the assig nment of the administrative law\\njudg e or how you or another party  will appear at the hearin g, unless we\\ndetermine a chang e will promote efficiency  in our hearing  process.\\n(1)The administrative law judg e will find good cause to change the time\\nor place of your hearing if he or she determines that, based on the\\nevidence:\\n(i) A serious physical or mental condition or incapacita ting injury\\nmakes it impossible for you or your representative to travel to the\\nhearing , or a death in the family  occurs; or\\n199\\n(ii) Severe weather conditions make it impossible for you or your\\nrepresentative to travel to the hearing .\\n(2)In determining  whether good cause exists in circumstances other than\\nthose set out in parag raph (f)(1) of this section, the administrative law\\njudge will consider your reason(s) for requesting  the chang e, the facts\\nsupporting  it, and the impact of the proposed chang e on the efficie nt\\nadministration of the hearing  process. Factors affecting  the impact of\\nthe chang e include, but are not limited to, the effect on the processing\\nof other scheduled hearing s, delays that might occur in rescheduling\\nyour hearing , and whether we previously  granted you any chang es in\\nthe time or place of your hearing . Examples of such other\\ncircumstances that you might give for requesting  a chang e in the time\\nor place of the hearing  include, but are not limited to, the following :\\n(i) You unsuccessfully  attempted to obtain a representativ e and\\nneed additional time to secure representation;\\n(ii) Your  representative was appointed within 30 days of the\\nscheduled hearing  and needs additional  time to prepare for the\\nhearing ;\\n(iii) Your representative has a prior commitment to be in court or\\nat another administrative hearing  on the date scheduled for the\\nhearing ;\\n(iv) A witness who will testify  to facts material to your case would\\nbe unavailable to attend the scheduled hearing  and the evidence\\ncannot be otherwise obtained;\\n(v) Transportation is not readily  available for you to travel to the\\nhearing ; or\\n(vi) You are unrepresented, and you are unable to respond to the\\nnotice of hearing  because of any physical, mental, educational, or\\nlinguistic limitations  (including  any lack of facility  with the\\nEnglish lang uage) which y ou may  have.\\n15.As the ALJ who conducted the hearing  was not available to issue the  decision\\nand the new ALJ issued an unfavorable decision which, in part, rejected the\\nclaimant’s allegations of pain and other symptoms, the new ALJ erred in not\\nconducting  a hearing  to fully evaluate the claimant’s alleg ations as suggested\\nin HAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B) discusses the circumstance when the\\nALJ who conducted the hearing  is not available to issue the decision, stating :\\nExcept in the limited circumstances outlined in HAL LEX I-2-8-40 C\\nbelow, the HOCAL J will reassig n a case, on a rotational basis, to another\\nALJ when the ALJ who conducted the hearing  is unavailable to issue a\\ndecision.  The ALJ to whom the case is reassig ned will review all the\\nevidence of record, including  the audio recording  of the hearing  (see\\n200\\nHAL LEX I -2-6-40 for more information about hearing  recording s). \\nIf the reassigned ALJ intends to issue a fully  favorable decision after\\nreviewing  the record and the audio recording , the ALJ need not conduct\\nanother hearing  and will issue a decision.  However, if the ALJ intends to\\nissue a less than fully  favorab le decision based on the information before\\nhim or her, or the ALJ requires more information to make a decision, the\\nALJ will assess whether another hearing  is necessary .  For example, the\\nALJ may find anoth er hearing  is necessary  if relevant expert evidence is\\nneeded but was not obtained at the hearing, or the ALJ needs additional\\ntestimony  to fully  evaluate a claimant’s allegations of pain and other\\nsymptoms.\\nIf the ALJ holds a new hearing , the ALJ will consider all pertinent\\ndocumentary  evidence admitted into the record at the prior hearing , the\\noral testimony  at the prior heari ng, and the evidence and testimony\\nadduced at the new hearing  when making  a decision.\\n16.The decision was not signed by the ALJ who held the hearing , and the\\ndocumentation required by HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B ) is not included in the \\nrecord.\\nApplicab le law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B ) specifies that the HOCAL J can sign a\\ndraft decision and any associated orders written by an unavailable ALJ.  “Any\\nsuch written authoriz ation must be associated with the claim(s) file and must\\ninclude the following  affirmative statements” from the unavailable AL J:\\n•The AL J has read the decision and any  associated order;\\n•The ALJ concurs with the decision (and any associated order) as written\\nor concurs with the decision (and any associ ated order) with specified\\nchang es previousl y reviewed and approved by the ALJ before\\nauthoriz ation; and \\n•HOCAL J (NAME)’ is authoriz ed to sign the decision and any associated\\norder on the AL J’s behalf.\\nHAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).  In addition, \\nThe ALJ may give written authoriz ation via email, fax, or any other\\nwriting . However, unless the authoriz ation is provided throu gh an official\\nagency  email, the ALJ must sign the written authorization with his or her\\n‘wet’ sig nature (facsimile transmission is accepted).  The ALJ may not use\\na rubber stamp or other mechanical signature.  A HOCAL J may not use\\nthis procedure on his or her own initiative without specific written\\nauthoriz ation from the AL J.\\n201\\nHAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).\\n17.The Appeals Council should remand this case for a de novo hearing  as the\\nhearing  recording  is incomplete [ or lost] .\\nApplicable law:  The Social Security  Act requires that all decisions of the\\nAppeals Council be based upon “the evidence adduced at the hearing .” 42\\nU.S.C. § 405(b).  The regulations further require that the Appeals Council\\nreview all the evidence in the hearing  record.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.976(b),\\n416.1476(b).\\nHAL LEX I -3-7-14(F ) provides that:\\nWhen the AC is considering  a request for review and finds that a claim(s)\\nfile is missing , or that a hearing  recording is lost or inaudible, it will first\\nfollow the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation Law\\n(HAL LEX) manua l I-3-1-12 and I-3-1-23. If the AC is unsuccessful in\\nresolving  the issue, it will grant the request for review and remand the\\ncase.\\nE.RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION63\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with HAL LEX I-2-1-80 in advising  the claimant\\nregarding  his/her rig ht to representation.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-1-80(B )(1) addresses the advisement of the\\nright to representation at an administrative law judge hearin g and states that\\nwhile “[a]n ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee is not required to recite specific\\nquestions regarding  the right to representation  or the claimant’s capacity  to\\nmake an informed choice about representation,” it sets forth “example s of\\nquestions the ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee could ask an unrepresented claimant\\non the record” which include:\\n•Did you receive the hearing  acknowledg ment letter and its\\nenclosure(s)?\\n•Do you understand the information contained in that letter, specifically\\nconcerning  representation?  \\nPursuant to HAL LEX I-2-1-80(A)(1) & (2), if a pre-hearing  conference\\n(“PHC”) or pre-hearing  development conference (“PHDC”) was held prior to\\nthe hearing , “the ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee must advise the claimant of the\\nright to representation during  that PHC” and document  “that the claimant was\\nadvised of the rig ht to representation.”\\n63 Some circuits have more favorable policies regarding right to counsel than those in the HAL LEX.\\n202\\nAt a hearing , if the claimant did not have a PHC or PHDC, the ALJ is not\\nrequired to ask the claimant any specific questions regarding  the right to\\nrepresentation.  The AL J may  ask the following  questions:\\n•Did you recei ve the hearing  acknowledg ment letter and its\\nenclosure(s)?\\n•Do you understand the information contained in that letter, specifically\\nconcerning  representation?  \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1) (citing  HAL LEX I -2-1-80(A)(2)).\\nThe ALJ may also communicate to the claimant the following  information, or\\nask the claimant other questions:\\n•There is no requirement that the claimant obtain a representative.\\n•If the claimant does not appoint a representative, SSA will make every\\nreasonable effort to obtain all relevant medical and non-medic al\\nrecords.\\n•The benefits of appointing  a representative include having the\\nrepresentative obtain evidence, prepare for procee dings before SSA,\\ndevelop the claimant’s claim(s), and present the claim(s) in an\\nadministrative hearing . If the claimant is unrepresented, an ALJ will\\nquestion the claimant at the hearing .\\n•If the claimant wishes to obtain a representat ive, he or she should\\nbegin the process of finding  a representative as soon as possible.\\n•Some representatives may charge a fee, but there are also legal service\\norganizations that may  represent the claimant free of charg e.\\n•If the claimant seeks to reschedule the hearing  to obtain a\\nrepresentative, an ALJ may deny the claimant’s request unless there is\\ngood cause.\\n•The claimant must affirm that he or she understands the information\\nexplained to him or her reg arding  the rig ht to representation.\\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1).  \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1) further provides that: \\nAn ALJ must ensure that the claiman t is aware of his or her options for\\nrepresentation.  Specifically , an ALJ will explain the availability  of both\\nfree legal services and conting ency representation, and discuss access to\\n203\\norganizations that assist individuals in obtaini ng representation.  An ALJ\\nwill answer any questions the claimant may have, including  explaining  the\\nclaimant’s options regarding  representation, as outlined in the\\nacknowledg ment letter. However, the ALJ will answer any questions in a\\nmanner that neither encourag es nor discourag es representation. \\nIf the claimant decides to waive the right to representation , the ALJ must\\ndetermine whether the claimant is capable of making  an informed choice\\nto waive the right to representati on. If the ALJ is satisfied that the\\nclaimant can make an informed decision, the ALJ must secure from the\\nclaimant a verbal waiver on-the-record or a written waiver,  which will be\\nmarked as an exhibit.  If the claimant requests to postpone the hearing  to\\nobtain a representative, the ALJ must consider the totality  of\\ncircumstances and decide on-the-record whether to grant the claimant’s\\nrequest for postponement.\\n2.The ALJ erred in not postponing  the hearing  to allow the claimant to obtain\\nrepresentation.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-1-80(B )(2) addresses postponement of the\\nhearing  to obtain representation and states:\\na.If the “record does not show that the claimant was previously\\ninformed of the right to representation at a PHC or PHDC,” and “the\\nclaimant requests postponement of the hearing  to obtain a\\nrepresentative, and it is the first request, an ALJ will typically  grant\\nthe requested postponement.”\\nb.“If the record shows that the claimant, during  either a PHC or PHDC,\\nwas previously  informed of the right to representation . . . the ALJ\\nmay deny  any request for postponement to obtain a representative.”\\nc.“However, the ALJ must consider the totality  of the circumstances\\nincluding any mental limitations that impair the claimant’s\\nunderstanding  regarding  the right to representation or any other factors\\nthat may indicate good cause (see, e.g., Social Security  Ruling  91-5p ,\\nTitles II and XVI: Mental Incapacity  and Good Cause for Missing the\\nDeadline to Request Review and HAL LEX I-2-0-60 for factors to\\nconsider when determi ning if there is ‘good cause’).  For example, an\\nALJ may be more likely  to grant a postponement when a claimant has\\nan intellectual disability  that prevented him or her from  understanding\\nthe right to representation.  An ALJ may also consider that the\\nclaimant made a good faith effort to obtain a representative but was\\nunable to find a representative willing to accept appointment.\\nHowever, in all cases, the ALJ will consider  the totality  of the\\ncircumstances in deciding  whether to grant a postponement.  If the\\nALJ denies the request for a postponement, the ALJ will explain to the\\n204\\nclaimant on-the-record at the hearing  the reasons for denying the\\nrequest.” \\nd.“If an ALJ grants postponement to obtain a representati ve, the ALJ\\nwill:\\n•Confirm that the claimant has been advised of the right to\\nrepresentation (following  the procedures in A.2.a or B .1. above); \\n•Give the claimant information about organizations that provi de\\nfree legal services, unless the claimant has indicated he or she\\nalready  has a representative in mind and the representative has\\nagreed to take the case; \\n•Advise the claimant to notify  the HO if representation is obtained;\\n \\n•Advis e the claimant that he or she will receive notification of the\\nnew hearing  date and time;\\n•Advise the claimant that normally  only one postponement is\\npermitted to obtain representation, unless there is g ood cause; \\n•Advise the claimant that if he or she appears at the rescheduled\\nhearing  without a representative, the hearing  will procee d without\\nthe representative, unless there is g ood cause; and \\n•Obtain from the claimant a signed “Acknowle dgment of\\nPostponement in Order to Obtain Representation” (HO staff will\\nexhibit the acknowledg ment letter and provide a copy to the\\nclaimant).”\\nF. RES JUDICAT A  \\n1.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that res judicata applies as the\\nfacts and/or issues are not the same as those in the prior determination.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that res judicata applies when there\\nare the same facts and issues and there has been a final prior determination. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.957(c)(1), 416.1457(c)(1) . This regulation provides that res\\njudicata applies when:\\nwe have made a previous determination or decision under this subpart\\nabout your rights on the same facts and on the same issue or issues, and\\nthis previous determination has become final by either administrative or\\njudicial action.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n205\\n2.  Given the existence of new and mater ial evidence, the ALJ’s finding of res \\njudicata cannot be sustained.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 68-12a notes the regulations indicate “that res judicata\\nshould be applied, among  other condition s not present here, only ‘on the same\\nfacts’”– a circumstance the hearing examiner had impliedly  conceded.64\\nAccording ly, where new and materi al evidence is presently  of record, “res\\njudicata may not be applied thereto, and the claimant may now be entitled to a\\nfavorable finding  on an issue previously  decided ag ainst him[ .]”\\nThe term “same material facts”  is addressed in HAL LEX 1-2-4-40 J, “Same\\nMaterial F acts -- No New and Material Evidence”:\\nThe term same material facts” means, in effect, that no new and material\\nevidence has been submitted since the last adjudicatio n on the prior claim.\\nThe ALJ will follow the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation\\nLaw (HALLEX) manual I-2-9-40 C to determine whether additional\\nevidence is new and mate rial. If, in connection with the current claim, the\\nclaimant submits  evidence that meets the regulatory  standard for new and\\n64 SSR 68-12a originated from the Appe als Council’s review of a case on its own motion.  The claimant had\\nfirst filed an application for benefits based on a back injury and headaches. No review was requested after\\nthat application was denied initially.  The claimant then filed a new application, adding that he had heart\\ntrouble.  This claim was also denied and no further review requested.  Finally, the claimant filed a third\\napplication, again alleging disability due to a back injury.  All three applications alleged the same date of\\nonset.  After the final claim was denied initially and upon reconsideration, the claimant requested a hearing\\nbefore a hearing examiner.  The hearing examiner apparently determined that, in addition to the doctrine of\\nadministrative finality barring a finding of disability in regard to initial determinations on prior applications\\nthat had become “final and binding,” any finding of entitlement was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.\\nThe Appe als Council disagreed and held that, although reopening of the initial determination was precluded\\nsince more than 4 years had elapsed before new and material evidence was submitted with the subsequent\\napplication, a determination of entitlement to a period of disability and disability insurance benefits based\\non that subsequent application was not precluded by res judicata as the determination need not be based on\\nthe same facts pertinent to the same issue as the prior unfavorable determination.  The hearing examiner’s\\nfinding of non-disability was determined to be contrary to the evidence. Despite carefully studying the\\nevidence, the Appe als Council failed “to find credible medical evidence to the effect that the claimant’s\\nimpairments were in fact remediable, or that even after completion of the recommended surgery that the\\nattending physicians ever declared him able to return to substantial gainful activity at any reasonably\\ndeterminable time in the future.”  To the contrary:\\nthere was virtually an unanimity of opinion, both lay and medical, that rehabilitation was not feasible\\nand that he could not be successfully placed in any of the available work programs.  It is\\nconvincingly shown that, in spite of what appeared to be competent medical supervision over a long\\nperiod of time, the claimant’s physical status continued to deteriorate.  His impairments have\\ncontinued undiminished over a span of about 9 years and there is no persuasive evidence that any\\nsignificant improvement may reasonably be expected.\\nThus, the claimant was deemed entitled to benefits based on the new application and awarded benefits\\nbeginning with the twelfth month bef ore the month in which he f iled the application.\\n206\\nmaterial evidence,  the facts are not the same and administrative res\\njudicata would not apply .\\nNOTE:  To evaluate whether evidence meets the regulatory  standard for\\nnew and material evidence, the ALJ must know what evidence was used to\\nmake the prior decision. According ly, the ALJ may need to obtain the\\nprior claim file to review that evidence.\\nTo determine whether the “same material facts” exist, a hearing may need\\nto be held: HAL LEX 1-2-4-40 M, When a Hearing is Needed to\\nDetermine Whether There is New and Material Evidence - An ALJ may\\nschedule a limited hearing  if there is indication that testimony  from the\\nclaimant, the treating  physician, or some other witness might constitute\\nnew and material evidence under HALLEX I-2-9-40 C. In this situation,\\nthe following  procedures apply :\\n1.Include the following  in the Notice of Hearing :\\na. A reference to the prior application,\\nb. A statement that a hearing will be held to ascertain whether\\nadditional testimony will warrant revision of the prior\\ndetermination or decision, and\\nc.A statement that if the additional testimony  does not warrant\\nrevision of the prior determination or decision, the current  RH will\\nbe dismissed on the basis of administrative res judicata.\\n2.If, after the hearing , the ALJ finds that there is no new and material\\nevidence (as defined in HAL LEX I-2-9-40 C) or other basis for\\nreopening  the prior determination or decision, the ALJ should dismiss\\nthe request for a hearing  and include in the dismissal order a\\ndiscussion of the testimony  at the hearing  and the AL J’s rationale.\\n3.The ALJ erred in apply ing the doctrine of administrative finality  to find that\\nthe claimant’s claim was barred when it did not apply  to the facts and\\ncircumstances of this case g iven the ex istence of new and material evidence.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 68-12a, even in cases where the prior\\ndetermi nations have become final, res judicata does not apply  where the\\nrecord presently contains new and material evidence. SSR 68-12a emphasiz es\\nthat the concept of res judicata should not be confused “with the rules of\\nadministrative finality  . . ., which . . . merely  precl ude the reopening  of a prior\\nunfavorable  decision under an earlier application where the initial\\nadministrative denial thereof was more than 4 years from the filing  date of the\\ncurrent application.” It explains that “even thoug h -- as in the instant case --\\nthe lapse of time may prevent the reopening of prior determinations to the\\ncontra ry” a claimant may still be entitled to a finding  of disability  based on\\nnew and material evidence.\\nHAL LEX I-2-4-40 addresses administrative res judicata and explains the \\n207\\ndifference betwe en res judicata and administrative res judicata and sets forth\\nwhen administrative res judicata does not apply .  This section  provides:\\nA. General\\nThis section explains administrative res judicata as it applies to decisions\\nunder the Social Security  Act (Act). When a prior determination  or\\ndecision with respect to the same party , facts, and issue(s) has become\\nadministratively  final, the doctrine of administrative res judicata may be\\nused to dismiss a request for hearing  (RH) entirely  or to refuse to consid er\\nan issue(s) on a subsequent application arising from the same title of the\\nAct. The purpose of administrati ve res judicata is to protect the Social\\nSecurity Administration (SSA) from having  to repeatedly  consider a claim\\nthat has been finally  decided.

Application of  Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe regulations at 20 CFR 404.947(c)(1) and 416.1457(c)(1) provide that\\nadministrative res judicata ex ists when:\\n1.There has been a previous determination or decision under the same\\nsubpart with respect to the same party ;\\n2.The previous determination or decision was based on the same facts\\nand on the same issue(s); and\\n3.The previous determination or decision has become final by either\\nadministrative or judici al action. The regulations allow an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) to dismiss an RH on the basis of\\nadministrative res judicata. Altho ugh such dismissal is discretionary ,\\nan ALJ should apply  the doctrine of res judicata when the requisite\\nconditions are met. It is possible to dismi ss one or more issues on the\\nbasis of administrative res judicata and still render a decision on other\\nissues.\\n4.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that administrative res judicata\\napplies as there has been a chang e in a specific section in the Listing  of\\nImpairments.\\n5.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that administrative res judicata\\napplies as the prior determination was not administratively  final because the\\nclaimant lacked mental competency  to appeal the prior determination.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-2-4-40, addressing  “Administrative Res\\nJudicata,” provides:\\nC. When Adm inistrative Res Judicata is Not Applicable  - \\nAdministrative res judicata does not apply  when there has been a chang e\\n208\\nin issues; for example, when there has been a change in a specific section\\nin the Listing  of Impairments  (listing s); or when the prior determination is\\nnot administratively  final (e.g., the claimant lacked mental competency  to\\nappe al the prior determination, or the claimant was provided with\\nincorrect, incomplete, or misleading  information about when and how to\\nrequest administrative review).\\nD.

An issue at your\\nhearing  may be a fact that has already  been decided in one of our previous\\ndeterminations or decisions in a claim involving  the same parties, but\\narising under a different title of the Act or under the Federal Coal Mine\\nHealth and Safety  Act.

It provides guidance on how this new policy will be applied to\\npotential collateral estoppel claims currently  pending  at various listed agency\\noffices.\\nThe EM states: \\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of\\ndisability  in a subsequent claim by the same individual for a different\\ndisability  benefit or SSI payments if, in our prior final determination or\\ndecision, we have already  decided that the individual is disable d for the\\nperiod in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1. Both the prior determination or decision  and new claim require\\napplication of the same statutory  definition of disability .\\n2. We have not made an intervening  medica l determination or decision\\nfinding  that the individual’s disability  ceased.\\n3. The individual has not engaged in substantial gainful activity  since the\\nprior established onset date (EOD). \\n4. The EOD in the prior claim is on or before the date when the\\nnonmedical requirements for entitlement are last met in the new claim.\\n213\\n5. The record with the prior favorable disability determination or\\ndecision is not in terminated status.\\n6. We do not have reason to believe that the prior disability\\ndetermination or decision was wrong .\\nThe new policy applies to subsequent claims and appeals filed on or after\\nthe effective date; to initial claims and appeals pending  as of the effec tive\\ndate; and to closed claims in which SSA or the claimant “ques tioned the\\nagency ’s prior final determination or decision in writing ” within one year\\nof the date of the notice of the initial determination.\\n“Questioning  the determination or decision in writing ” occurs when\\nclaimant files a subsequent claim for the same benefit alleg ing an onset\\ndate within the period adjudic ated by the prior determination or decision;\\nor claimant otherwise indicates in writing  that they disagree with the\\ndetermination or decision; or SSA indicates in writing  that it is\\nconsidering  reopening  and revising  the determination or decision.\\nTo meet the one-year requirement a subsequent application, other written\\nrequest for reopening  (express or implied), or other written expression of\\ndisag reement with the prior determination or decision must be made\\nwithin one year of the date of the notice of the initial determination; and\\nthe questioning  must either occur after or be pending  a response from SSA\\nas of the effective date.\\nA subsequent claim for a previously  denied benefit is considere d an\\nimplied request to reopen the prior determination  or decision when the\\nclaimant alleg es an onset date of disability  within the previously\\nadjudicat ed period. In such cases, the subsequent claim satisfies the\\nsecond claim criterion if filed within one year of the date of the notice of\\nthe initial determination associated with the prior final determination or\\ndecision.\\nSee also updates to POMS DI 11011 TN 5 and POMS DI 27515 TN 12\\nexplaining  how SSA employ ees must implement these chang es. \\nH.

See HAL LEX I -2-8- 25(A).\\n2.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the post-hearing  evidence submitted by the\\n214\\nclaimant to the record and to consider this evidence in rendering  his/her\\ndecision.\\nApplicable law :  HAL LEX I -2-7-20(A) provides:\\nGenerally , an administr ative law judge (ALJ) may decline to consider or\\nobtain evidence that a claimant did not inform  the Social Security\\nAdministration (SSA) about or submit at least five business days before\\nthe date of the scheduled hearing , unless the circumstances in 20 C.F.R.\\n404.935(b ) and 416.1435(b) apply  (see Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation\\nLaw (HAL LEX) manual I -2-6-58 and I -2-6-59).\\nWhen a claimant or appointed representative misses the five-day  deadline\\nand requests additional time to submit evidence after the heari ng, the ALJ\\ngenerall y will evaluate whether the circumstances in 20 C.F.R. 404.935(b)\\nand 416.1435(b) apply  using  the procedures in HAL LEX I -2-6-59.\\nNOTE:\\nIn title XVI cases other than those based on an application for benefits\\n(e.g., age 18 redetermi nations, continuing  disability  reviews, and\\nterminations), the ALJ will accept any evidence submit ted on or before the\\ndate of the hearing  decision.

LATE FILING OF THE REQUEST FOR RE VIEW66\\n1.The Appeals Council should find good cause, as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.911, 416.1511 for the claimant’s late filing  of his/her Request for Review.\\nApplicable law :  20 C.F .R. § 404.968(b) states:\\nExtension of time to request review .  You or any party to a hearing\\ndecision may ask that the time for filing a request for the review be\\nextended.  The request for an extension of time must be in writing .  It\\nmust be filed with the Appeals Council, and it must give the reasons why\\nthe request for review was not filed within the stated time period.  If you\\nshow that you had good cause for missing  the deadline, the time period\\nwill be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the\\nstandards ex plained in § 404.911.\\nSee also 20 C.F .R. § 416.1482 (same).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911(a), 416.1311 provide that in determining  whether a\\nclaimant has shown good cause for missing  a deadline to request review, SSA\\nconsiders:  (1) what circumstan ces kept the claimant from making  the request\\non time; (2) whether SSA’s actions misled the claimant; (3) whether the\\nclaimant did not understand “the requirements of the Act resulting  from\\namendments to the Act, other  legislation, or court decisions;” and (4) whether\\nthe claimant had any “phy sical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations\\n(including  any lack of facility  with the English language)” which prevented\\nhim/her from filing  a timely  request or from understanding  or knowing  about\\nthe need to file a timely  request for review. Id. See also  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.1411(b) (same).\\nThis regulation further sets forth examples in determining  whether  a claimant\\nhas shown to have “good cause for missing  a deadline to request review”\\nwhich include the following :\\n66 Requests for extensions of time submitted before a civil action is filed are governed by HALLEX I-3-9-\\n92(B), which also states that such requests must include a good cause reason for requesting the extension. \\n“If the claimant or appointed representative does not provide a good cause reason for requesting an\\n[extension], the AC will deny the request.”  Id.  The Appe als Council follows the good cause standards set\\nforth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 405.20, and 416.1411.  Any delay in the Appe als Council’s response to the\\nextension “request is not a factor the AC considers in determining whether good cause exists for not filing\\na civil action within the stated time.”  HALLEX I-3-9-92(B) (Note).  Further, when an extension is granted,\\nthe AC “will generally provide up to 30 days from the date of the notice granting the [extension] (or, if more\\nappro priate, up to 30 days from the date of the civil action filing deadline) to file a civil action,” although the\\nAppe als Council “may grant more or less time depending on the circumstances of the individual case.” \\nHAL LEX I-3-9-92(B) .  However, when the Appe als Council denies the extension request, the “AC will\\ninclude in the notice a sufficient rationale explaining its finding that there is not a good cause reason to extend\\nthe time to file a civil action.”  Id.\\n217\\n(1)You were seriously  ill and were prevented from contacting  us in\\nperson, in writing , or throug h a friend, relative, or other person.\\n(2)There was a death or serious illness in y our immediate family .\\n(3)Important  records were destroy ed or damag ed by fire or other\\naccidental cause.\\n(4)You were trying very hard to find necessary information to support\\nyour claim but did not find the information within the stated time\\nperiods.\\n(5)You asked us for addit ional information explaining  our action within\\nthe time limit, and within 60 days of receiving  the explanation you\\nrequested reconsideration or a hearing, or within 30 days of receiving\\nthe explanation you requested Appeal Council review or filed a civil\\nsuit.\\n(6)We gave you incorrect or incomplete information about when and how\\nto request administrative review or to file a civil suit.\\n(7)You did not receive notice of the determination or decision.\\n(8)You sent the request to another Government agency  in good faith\\nwithin the time limit and the request did not reach us until after the\\ntime period had ex pired.\\n(9)Unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist, including  the\\ncircumstances descri bed in parag raph (a)(4) of this section, which\\nshow that you could not have known of the need to file timely , or\\nwhich prevented y ou from filing  timely .\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.911(b), 416.1411(b).\\n2.The claimant’s failure to timely  request review should be excused in light of\\nhis/her mental impairments as discussed in SSR 91-5p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 91-5p discusses the procedure SSA follows in cases\\nwhere a claimant fails to make  a timely  request for review but may have good\\ncause for failing  to do so due to mental incapacity . The Ruling explains that\\nSSA policy  has never been to consider failure to timely  request review as an\\nautomatic g round for dismissing  the appeal.\\nWhere claimants present evidence of mental incapacity  that may have\\nprevented an understanding  of the review process, SSA will consider whether\\ngood cause exists for extending  the time for requesting  review without regard\\nto how much time has passed. SSR 91-5p acknowledg es that 20 C.F.R. §\\n218\\n404.911 specifies, in essentially  the same lang uage as § 416.1411(a), the\\nfactors considered in determining  whether a claimant has shown good cause\\nfor missing  a deadline to request review.\\nPursuant to SSR 91-5p, adjudi cators must resolve reasonable doubts in favor\\nof a claimant and, while basing  the decision on all pertinent facts, must\\nconsider four factors in determining  whether “a claimant lacked the mental\\ncapacity  to understand the procedures for requesting  review”: \\n•inability  to read or write;\\n•lack of facility  with the Eng lish lang uage;\\n•limited education; or\\n•any menta l or physical condition which limits the claimant’s ability  to\\ndo thing s for him/herself.\\nSSR 91-5 explains that where claimants present evidence of mental incapacity\\nthat may  have prevented an understanding  of the review process, SSA will\\nconsider whether good cause exists for extending  the time for requesting\\nreview without regard to how much time has passed.  The decision regarding\\nmental incapacity  is to be “based on all the pertinent facts in a particular\\ncase.”\\nA finding  of good cause will result in an extensio n of time for requesting\\nreview and the adjudicator will “take the action which would have been\\nappr opriate had the claimant filed a timely  request for review.”  SSR 91-5p\\nmandates that if good cause is determined to exist, the adjudicator “will\\nextend the time for requesting  review and take the action which would have\\nbeen appropriate had the claimant filed a timely  request for review.”  Thus,\\nwhere good cause exists, the adjudicator does not have discretion and must\\ngrant the ex tension.\\nIf, on the other hand, the adjudicator decides good cause is absent, the request\\nfor extension of time will be denied and the request for review dismissed. \\nThe adjudicator is to provide a rationale for not finding  good cause and notify\\nthe claimant that a new application may  be filed using the date of the written\\nrequest for review as a protective filing  date.\\nSSR 91-5p provides that where any of the four factors (inability  to read or\\nwrite; lack of facility  with the English lang uage; limited educ ation; any\\nmental or physical condition which limits the claimant’s ability to do thing s\\nfor him/herself) are present and the claimant is unrepresented, the adjudicator\\nis to assist the claimant in obtaining  relevant evidence bearing  upon mental\\nincapacity .\\nSSR 91-5p specifies the adjudicator is to provide a rationale for not finding\\ngood cause and notify  the claimant that a new application may  be filed usin g\\nthe date of the written request for review as a protective filing  date.\\n219\\nHAL LEX 1-2-4-40, addressing  res judicata, provides\\nE. Mental Competence -- Prior Determination Not Admini stratively  Final\\nand Administrative Res Judicata Not Applicable - When an ALJ\\nAddresses Mental Competence- An ALJ must address and resolve in the\\ndecision or dismissal the issue of whether a claimant lacked the mental\\ncompetence to pursue the appeal when:\\n•The ALJ considers the application of administrative finality  or\\nadministrative res judicata to a determination or decision made on\\na prior application;\\n• There is evidence that a claimant lacked the mental capacity  to\\ntimely  request review of an adverse determination, decision,\\ndismissal, or review by  a federal district court; and\\n• The claimant had no one legally responsible for prosecuting the\\nclaim.\\nIf the claimant satisfies the substantive criteria, the time limits in the\\nreopening  regulations do not apply. In that situation, regardless of how much\\ntime has passed since the prior administrative action, the claimant can\\nestablish good cause for extending  the deadline to request review of that\\naction. If the ALJ finds that good cause exists, he or she will extend the time\\nfor requesting  review and take the action that would have been appro priate\\nhad the claimant filed a timely  appeal. In that instance, administrative finality\\nand administrative res judicata will not apply .\\nJ. HEARING S BEFORE THE APPE ALS CO UNCIL\\n1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral \\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n2.The Appeals Council erred by failing  to notify  claimant and his/her\\nrepresentativ e that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\nApplicable law: 20 CFR § 404.976 address procedures before  the Appeals\\nCouncil on review and provides in pertinent part:\\n(b) Oral argument. You may request to appear before the Appeals Council\\nto present oral argument. The Appeals Council will grant your request if it\\ndecides that your case raises an important question of law or policy  or that\\noral argument would help to reach a proper decision. If your request to\\nappear is granted, the Appeal s Council will tell you the time and place of\\n220\\nthe oral argument at least 10 business days before the scheduled date. You\\nwill appear before the Appeals Council by video teleconferencing  or in\\nperson, or, when the circumstances described in § 404.936(c)(2) exist, we\\nmay schedule you to appear by telephone. The Appeals Council will\\ndetermine whether any other person relevant to the proceeding  will appear\\nby video teleconferencing , telephone, or in person as based on the\\ncircumstances described in § 404.936(c)(4).\\nNOTE:\\nIf oral argument at the Appeals Council level is scheduled by video\\nteleconferencing , the rule does not provide for the claimant to opt out of\\nvideo teleconferencing  in favor of in person oral argument, as is permitted\\nunder the rules applicable to the AL J hearing  level.\\nSee also HAL LEX I-3-8-12 , Request for Appearance —  when the\\nAppeals Council (AC) grants a request for review or reviews an ALJ\\ndecision or order of dismissal on its own motion and sends a separate\\nnotice of review with its propo sed final action, the AC will notify  the\\nclaimant and any representative that they may request an appearance\\nbefore the AC to present oral argument.  The  AC will grant a request for\\nan appearance if it determined that:\\n•an important question of law or policy  is presented; or\\n•oral argument would benefit the AC in rendering a proper decision\\nin the case.  \\n3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issue d a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nApplicable Law: Unde r a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA\\nrevised its rules to clarify  when and how administrative appe als judges (AAJ )\\non the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisio ns. See Hearings\\nHeld by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 Fed. Reg.\\n73138 (Nov. 16, 2020).  Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the\\nauthority  to hold hearing s and issue decisions under the existing statute and\\nregulations, but SSA had not exercised this authority  or explained the\\ncircumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals Council to\\nassume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\n221\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Removal of a hearing request(s) to the\\nAppeals Council)  provides that the “Appeals Council  may assume\\nresponsibility  for a hearing request(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the\\nadministrative review process” and requires sending  a “notice to all parties\\nthat the Appeals Counc il has assumed responsibility  for the case(s).” The\\nAppeals Council is required to cond uct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961 , applicable to SSDI  claims and 416.1429\\nthrough 416.1461, applicable to SSI claims. Appeals Council review may be\\nrequested by any party  dissatisfied with the hearing  decision or with the\\ndismissal of a hearing  request, following  the procedures in §§ 404.96 7\\nthroug h 404.982 for SSDI  claims and §§ 416.1429 throug h 416.1461 for SSI\\nclaims.  The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judg e\\nwho conducted a hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismis sed a hearing\\nrequest will not participate  in any action associated with the request for\\nAppeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456. \\nK.SUBMISSIO N OF NE W EVIDENCE  TO THE APPE ALS\\nCOUNCIL\\n1.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers]  warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decisio n and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n2.Even thoug h the eviden ce is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***] and there is good cause for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable probability  that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decis ion, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-4p notes that the Appeals Council will not obtain or\\nevaluate additional  evidence unless (1) “one of the circumstances listed in 20\\nCFR 404.970( b) or 416.1470(b) applies and the individual or his or her\\nreprese ntative shows that the evidence is related to the period on or before the\\ndate of the hearing  level decision”; or (2) “the claim is a title XVI claim that\\nis not based on an application for benefits (e.g ., an ag e-18 redetermination).” \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970(b), 416.1570(b) sets forth the circumstances under\\nwhich the Appeals Council will review a case.  Subsection (a)(5) states that\\nthe Appeals Council  will receive additional evidence which is “new, material,\\nand relates to the period on or before the date of the hearing  decision, and\\n222\\nthere is a reasonable probability  that the additional evidence would chang e the\\noutcome of the decision.”  However, this reg ulation g oes on to state that:  \\nThe Appeals Council will only consider additional evidence under\\nparag raph (a)(5) of this section if you show good cause for not informing\\nus about or submitting  the evidence as described in § 404.935 because:\\n(1) Our action misled y ou;\\n(2)You had a physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation( s) that\\nprevented you from informing  us about or submitting the evidence\\nearlier; or\\n(3)Some other unusua l, unex pected, or unavoidable circumstance beyond\\nyour control prevented you from informing  us about or submitting  the\\nevidence earlier.  Ex amples include, but are not limited to:\\n  (i)You were seriously ill, and your illness prevented you from\\ncontacting  us in person, in writing , or throug h a friend, relative, or\\nother person;\\n(ii)There was a death or serious illness in y our immediate family ;\\n(iii)Important records were destroy ed or damag ed by fire or other\\naccidental cause;\\n(iv)You actively  and diligently sought evidence from a source and the\\nevidence was not received or was received less than 5 business\\ndays prior to the hearing ; or\\n(v)You received a hearing  level decisio n on the record and the\\nAppeals Council reviewed y our decision.\\nFor procedures on considering  additional evidence, see HAL LEX I-3-5-\\n20.  \\nHAL LEX I-3-3-6 addresses submission of new and material evidence to\\nthe Appeals Council.  HAL LEX I-3-3-6(B ) states, in part:\\nGenerally , the AC will only consider additional evidence as a basis for\\ngranting  review if the claimant meets one of the good cause exceptions\\nset forth in 20 C.F.R. 404.970(b) and 416.1470(b); the additional\\nevidence is new, material, and relates to the period on or before the\\ndate of the hearing  decision; and there is a reasonable proba bility that\\nthe additional evidence will chang e the outcome of the decision . . ..\\nNOTE 1:\\nThe AC has broad discretion when evaluat ing whether a claimant\\nmeets a good cause exception.  However, the AC will not infer good\\ncause for missing  the deadline to timely  submit evidence solely\\nbecause a claimant  is unrepresented.  When an unrepresented claimant\\n223\\nsubmits additional evidence, the AC will consider all factors present in\\nthe record and any  statements from the claimant. . . . \\nNOTE 2:\\nThe AC will determine that the claimant actively  and dilig ently  soug ht\\nevidence from a source when any evidence suggests that the\\ndocuments were timely  requested.  The AC will not investig ate the\\nissue or require a showing  of proof that the claimant actively  and\\ndilig ently  soug ht the evidence. . . .\\n2.  New, Material, and Relates to the Period On or Before the\\nHearing Decision\\nAdditional evidence is new if it is not part of the claim(s) file as of the\\ndate of the hearing  decision.\\nAdditional  evidence is material if it is relevant, i.e., involves or is\\ndirectly  related to issues adjudicated by  the AL J.\\nAdditional evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision if the evidence is dated on or before the date of the\\nhearing decision, or the evidence post-dates the hearing  decision but is\\nreasonably  related to the time period adjudicated in the hearing\\ndecision.\\nNOTE:\\nThe AC does not apply  a strict deadline when determining  whether\\npost-dated evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision.  There are circumstances when evidence  dated after\\nthe hearing decision relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision.  For example, a statement  may relate to the period on\\nor before the date of the hearing  decision when it postdates the\\ndecision but makes a direct reference to the time period adjudicated in\\nthe hearing decision.  This may be especially  important in a claim\\ninvolving  an expired date last insured (DLI) when a statement from  a\\nmedical source dated after the hearing  decision specifically  addresse s\\nthe time period before the DL I.\\nCommon examples of evidence that is not related to the period on or\\nbefore the date of the hearing  decision include evidence that shows:\\n•A worsening  of the condition after the expiration of a DLI in a title\\nII disability  insurance benefits claim.\\n•A worsening  of the condition after  the last day of the prescribed\\nperiod in a widow(er)’s insura nce benefits claim based on\\ndisability .\\n•A worsening  of the condition after the claimant attained age 22 in\\n224\\na child’s insurance benefits claim based on disability .\\n•A worsening  of the condition or onset of a new condition after the\\ndate of the AL J decision.\\nAs set forth in HAL LEX I -3-2-15(A), claimants:\\n. . . must inform or submit to the Social Security  Administration\\n(SSA) all evidence, in its entirety , known to him or her that relates\\nto whether or not he or she is blind or disabled.  See 20 C.F.R.\\n404.1512 and 416.912. If a claimant has a representative, then the\\nrepresentative must help the claimant obtain the information or\\nevidence that the claimant must submit.

(For more information about who is a party to the\\nhearing , see HAL LEX I -2-1-45);\\n•The claimant has knowing ly waived his or her right to examine the\\nevidence (see HAL LEX I -2-7-25); or\\n•The AL J issues a fully  favorable decision.\\n7.The ALJ erred in dismissing the claimant’s comments regarding  the post-\\nhearing  ME evidence in the hearing  decision.\\n8.The ALJ dismissed the claimant’s objections without ruling  on the proffered\\nME evidence.\\n9.The ALJ erred in not scheduling  a suppl emental hearing  for the purpose of\\nallowing  the claimant to cross-ex amine the ME.\\n10.The ALJ erred when s/he did not provide any reasons for his/her rejection of\\nthe claimant’s request to question the post-hearing  ME at a supplemental\\nhearing .\\n11.The ALJ erred w hen s/he did not notify  the claimant of his/her right to request\\na supplemental hearing  with the opportunity  to question the ME pursuant to\\nHAL LEX I -2-5-44 and I -2-7-30.\\nApplic able law:  When the ALJ receives a medical expert’s response to\\nwritten interrog atories, HAL LEX I-2-5-44(A) requires that the ALJ proffer a\\ncopy  of the responses using  the procedures in [HAL LEX] manual I-2-7-30.”53 \\nIf the opinion is recei ved post-hearing  and “the claimant waived the right to\\nexamine the evidence and appear at a supplemental  hearing ,” the ALJ must\\nfollow the procedures for exhibiting the evidence set forth in HAL LEX I-2-7-\\n35.54\\nHAL LEX I -2-5-44(B ) provides:\\n53 HAL LEX I -2-7-30 Pr offer Procedures was discussed at pages 182- 83, supra.\\n54 HAL LEX I -2-7-35 is discussed at page 189, infra.\\n185\\nAn ALJ must rule on any objection or request by the claimant regarding\\nthe ME’s response to interrog atories.   The ALJ may rule on an objection\\non the record during  the hearing  or in a writing  that the ALJ exhibits and\\nassociates with the record.  An ALJ must allow a claimant or appointed\\nrepresentative to propose additional interrog atories to the ME or request a\\nsupplemental hearing to question the ME, even if the claimant or\\nappointed representative previously  had the opportunity  to do so.\\nNOTE 1:\\nThe ALJ decision must include the rationale for ruling  against any\\nobjection.  If the claimant requests a supplemental hearing,  the ALJ must\\ngrant the request, unless the ALJ receives additional documentary\\nevidence that supports a fully  favorable decision.  The ALJ will consi der\\nthe information in HALLEX I-2-5-40 when determining  how the ME will\\nappear at a supplemental hearing .\\nNOTE 2:\\nIf the ME declines to appear at a supplemental hearing , the ALJ may\\nconsider issuing  a subpoena using  the instructions in HAL LEX I-2-5-78. \\nIf a subpoena is issued, see also HAL LEX I -2- 5-80 and I -2-5-82.\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-44(D) requires the ALJ to exhibit the response and any\\nrelated correspondence and states:\\nThe ALJ must include the response and any related correspo ndence in the re\\nas exhibits.  This includes all correspondence between the ALJ and the ME,\\nadmissible questions and responses, additional interrog atories and responses,\\nand proffered documents.  See HAL LEX I -2-7-35.\\n12.The ALJ violated HAL LEX I-2-5-44 when s/he did not hold a supplemental\\nhearing  as requeste d by the claimant in order to question the author of the\\npost-hearing  report.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5-44(B ) provides that “[i]f the claimant\\nrequests a supplemental hearing, the ALJ must grant the request, unless the\\nALJ receives additional documentary  evidence that supports a fully favorable\\ndecision.”\\n13.[Note: Applicable only in the F ifth Circuit]:\\nThe ALJ violated HAL LEX I-2-5-78(A)(note) and AR 91-1(5) in deny ing the\\nclaimant’s request to cross-ex amine Dr. ***, an examining  physician upon\\nwhose report the AL J substantially  relied in discrediting  the claimant.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-5-78(A)(Note) provides that “[i]n the Fifth\\nCircui t, if a claimant requests a subpoena for the purpose of cross- examining\\nan examining  physician, and the claimant makes the request prior to the\\nclosing  of the record, the ALJ must issue the subpoena.” The HAL LEX\\n186\\nreferences AR 91-1(5), which discusses the Fifth Circuit decision in Lidy v.\\nSullivan , 911 F.2d 1075 (5th Cir. 1990), holding  that a claimant has an\\nabsolute rig ht to subpoena a reporting  physician.  As set forth in AR 91-1(5):\\nThis ruling  applies only to cases involving  claimants for disability\\ninsurance  benefits and/or supplemental security  income payments based\\non disability  who reside in Louisi ana, Mississippi, or Texas at the time of\\nthe proceeding s at the disability  hearing , Administrative Law Judge, or\\nAppeal s Council levels.

The ALJ will use the procedures\\nin Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation Law (HAL LEX) manual I-2-5-56 to\\ndetermine whether to obtain additional comme nts via interrog atories or\\ntestimony  at a suppleme ntal hearing .  If interrog atories are used, the ALJ\\nwill follow the procedures in HALLEX I-2-5-57. If a supplemental\\nhearing is necessary , the ALJ will follow the procedures in HAL LEX I-2-\\n5-54.\\nNOTE:\\nIf the VE who provided an opinion at the initial hearing is no longer\\navailable to review the new evidence, the ALJ will obtain the services of\\nanother VE following  the instructions in HAL LEX I -2-5-52.\\nHAL LEX I-2-5-58 addresses the procedures the ALJ must follo w upon\\nreceipt of VE’s responses to interr ogatories.

RIGHT TO A HEARING59\\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with the Social Security  Act as well as the \\nCommissioner’s own policies in not scheduling  a hearing  in this case,\\nresulting  in prejudice to the claimant.\\n2.Even thoug h the claimant waived his/her right to a hearing , the ALJ failed  to\\ncomply  with HAL LEX I-2-1-82 in not tendering  post-hearing  evidence as\\nrequired.  \\nApplicable law:  The Soci al Security  Act provides that “the  Commissioner\\nshall give such applicant and such other individual reasonable notice and\\nopportun ity for a hearing  with respect to” any decision involving  a\\n“determination of disability  and which is in whole or in part unfavora ble to\\nsuch individual shall contain a statement of the case, in understandable\\nlanguage, setting  forth the discussion of the evidence, and stating  the\\nCommissioner’s determination and the reason or reasons upon which it is\\nbased.”  42 U.S.C. § 405(b)(1).\\nThe regulations provide that a claimant may waive the right to appear at\\nhis/her hearing  by sending  “the administrative law judge a waiver or a written\\nstatement indicating  that you do not wish to appear at the hearing .”  20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.950(b), 416.1450(b).  The regulations further provide that the claimant\\n“may  withdraw this waiver any time before a notice of the hearing  decision is\\nmailed.”  Id.  However, even in cases where a claimant waives his or her right\\nto appear at a hearing , the ALJ may schedule a hearing  if the ALJ believes\\nthat a “personal appear ance and testimony  by you or any other party  is\\nnecessary  to decide the case.” Id.\\nSocial Security  Ruling  79-19:\\nrequires that a claimant be given a thoroug h explanation of the hearing\\nproce dure, the claimant’s right to personally  appear and present evidence,\\nthe claimant’s right to representation, the value of a personal appearance\\nand the fact that absent a personal appearance the claim will be decided\\nsolely  on the written evidence on file\\n59This section addresses the recent regulatory amendments addressing the manner of setting the appearance\\nof parties and w itnesses at a hearing.\\n191\\nId.  The rationale behind this Ruling is a recog nition of the importance of the\\nhearing  appearance rights of claimants and voices a concern that a waiver of\\nthe right to appear be voluntary , based on a full understanding  of the\\nconsequences of such a decision.  Id.\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-82 addresses the waiver of the right to appear at the hearing\\nand states:\\nA claimant may waive the right to appear at a hearing  and request that an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) decide the case based on the evidence of\\nrecord. A waiver of the right to appear at a hearing must be in writing  and\\nsigned by the claimant. Any waiver must be made voluntari ly and\\nknowing ly, as defined in Social Security  Ruling  79-19: Titles II, XVI and\\nXVIII: Waiver of Personal Appearance at a Hearing .\\nWhile useful in assessing  the claimant’s intent, the checkbox  in question\\nsix in form HA-501-U5 “Request for Hearing  by Administrative Law\\nJudge” that states, “I do not wish to appear at a hearing  and I request that a\\ndecision be made based on the evidence in my case.  (Complete Waiver\\nForm HA-4608)” is not sufficient to show that the claimant “knowing ly”\\nsubmitted a waiver.\\n An ALJ may sched ule a hearing even when a claimant waives his or her\\nright to an appearance at a hearing , if the ALJ believes a personal\\nappearance and testimony  from the claimant are necessa ry to decide the\\ncase.  See 20 CFR 404.950(b) and 416.1450(b) , and Hearing s, Appeals\\nand L itigation L aw (HAL LEX) manual I -2-6-1.\\nNOTE:  If an ALJ schedules a hearing despite a claimant’s waiver, the\\nALJ will consider all evidence as required by 20 CFR 404.1512 and\\n416.912 that is received no later than five business days before the date of\\nthe hearing  (see 20 CF R 404.935 and 416.1435).\\nThis HAL LEX further directs that if a “claimant mark s the checkbox  in\\nquestion six in the request for hearing  or states in another writing  that he or\\nshe waives the right to appear at a hearing , hearing  office (HO) staff will\\nobtain written documentation from the claimant” which can be on form HA-\\n4608 “Waiver of Your Right to Personal Appear ance Before an\\nAdministrative Law Judge.”  Id.  This form, along  with “any correspondence\\nin the claim(s) file to help establish that the claimant subm itted the waiver\\nvoluntarily  and knowing ly” will be added to the record.  However, “form HA-\\n4608 is not required for a claimant to waive his or her right to appear  at a\\nhearing ” as it is “acceptable if the claimant elects to respond in a different\\nsigned writing  that provides the same information.”  Id.  Also, written\\ndocumentation is not required “if it was provided during  a pre-hearing\\n192\\nconference, because the recording  from the conference is part of the record.”60 \\nId. (citing  HAL LEX I -2-1-75 D).\\n \\nThe HAL LEX further provides that generally , a claimant still has a right to\\nsubmit written commentor respond to interrog atories or other evidence even\\nin those case where he or she waived his or her right ‘o a hearing  unless the\\nfollowing  conditions are met which do not require proffering  of evidence:    \\nE. Proffering  Evidence\\n1. Post-hearing Evidence\\nIf an ALJ schedules and holds a hearing  despite the claimant’s waiver of\\nthe right to appe ar at a hearing , the ALJ must proffer evidence received\\nafter a hearing, unless the claimant also waived the right to examine the\\nevidence or to appear at a supplemental hearing .  See subsection B above\\nand HAL LEX I -2-7-1, I -2-7-15, and I -2-7-30.\\n2.Vocational Expert and/or Medical Expert Testimony\\nIf an ALJ schedules and holds a hearing  despite a waiver, the ALJ may\\nneed to proffer testimony  received from a vocational expert and/or\\nmedical expert(s) at the hearing , depe nding on whether the claimant had\\nnotice of the expert testimony  prior to waiving  his or her right to appear at\\nthe hearing .\\nIf the claimant waived his or her right to appear at the hearing  after\\nreceiving  a notice of hearing  informing  him or her that a vocational expert\\nand/or medic al expert(s) is scheduled to appear, the ALJ will not need to\\nproffer testimony  received from such expert(s) noticed to appear.  See\\nsubsection B  above.\\nIf the claimant waived the right to appear at the hearing  before receiving\\nnotice that a vocational expert and/or medical expert(s) is scheduled to\\nappear, and the claimant was not subsequently  informed of such potential\\nexpert testimo ny pursuant to subsection B above, the ALJ must proffer the\\ntestimony  by such expert(s), followi ng the procedures in E.1 above. \\nHowever, if the claimant reaffir med his or her waiver to appear after\\nreceiving  notice of such expert(s) scheduled appearance, the ALJ will not\\nneed to proffer testimony  from such ex pert(s).\\n60 HAL LEX I -2-1-82 addre sses pre-hearing conferences and st ates:\\nPre-hearing Conference (PHC)  and Pr e-hearing Development Contacts (PHDC)\\n \\nEven if a claimant waives his or her right to appear at a hearing, an ALJ or an authorized designee may\\nschedule a PHC, when necessary, to narrow and clarify issues.

If the ALJ holds the\\nhearing , despite the waiver, and neither the claimant nor any appointed\\nreprese ntative appear, the ALJ may not dismiss the request for hearing . \\nSee HAL LEX I-2-4-25 F. Rather, an ALJ must  decide the case based on\\nthe evidence of record.  An AL J will ex plain in the decision:\\n• The reason for requesting  the claimant’s appearance and the AL J’s\\nefforts to put the claimant on notice of the need for the hearing ;\\nand\\n•Any adver se presumptions regarding  the weig ht of the evidence\\nthat arose from the claimant’s refusal to appear.\\n \\nNOTE:  If circumstances suggest that a representative routinely  advises his or\\nher clients to waive the right to appear at a hearing  or to ignore scheduled\\nhearing  despite the waiver, an ALJ will consider whether it would be\\nappropriate to submit a referral to the Office of the General Counsel under\\nHAL LEX I -1-1-50 for possible representative misconduct.\\n3.The ALJ did not comply  with HAL LEX I-2-4-25 in dismissing  the request for\\nhearing  because the claimant did not appear at the hearing .\\n4.The ALJ committed reversible error and violated claimant’s due process right\\nto a fundamentally  fair hearing  by proceeding  without claiman t’s presence\\nand testimony  at his/her hearing without properly  following  the procedures\\ndictate d by HAL LEX I-2-4-25(D)(2) even thoug h his/her representative was\\npresent.\\n   5.The ALJ did not comply with the procedures set forth  in HALLEX I-2-4-\\n25(D)(2) in not sending  the Request to Show Cause for Failure to Appear and\\naffording  the claimant the opportunity  to explain the reasons for the failure to\\nappear.\\nApplicable law :  HAL LEX I -2-4-25(D)(2) provides:\\nIf an appointe d representative appears at the scheduled hearing  without the\\nclaimant and continues to represent the claima nt during  the hearing ,\\ndismissal is never appropriate. However, the ALJ may determine that the\\nclaimant has constructively  waived the rig ht to appear at the hearing  if:\\n194\\n•the representative is unable to locate the claimant,\\n•the Notice of Hearing  was mailed to the claimant’s last known\\naddress, and \\n•the contact procedures required by 20 C.F.R. 404.938 and 416.1438,\\nas described in HAL LEX I -2-3-20, have been followed.\\nIf the ALJ finds that the claimant has constructively  waived the right to\\nappear at the hearing , the ALJ need not proceed with the hearing  and may\\nchoose to issue a decision on the record.   However, if medical expert or\\nvocational expert testimony  is needed to resolve the case, the ALJ may choo se\\nto proceed with the hearing , accepting  the testim ony of the witness(es) and\\nallowing  the appointed representative to question the witness(es) and make\\narguments on the claimant’s behalf.\\nIn any event, the ALJ will advise the appointed repres entative, either on the\\nrecord during  the hearing  or in writing  thereafter, that he or she will not send a\\nRequest to Show Cause for Failure to Appear to the claimant because the\\nclaimant has constructively  waived the right to appear at a hearing . When\\ndone in writing , the AL J must associate the writing  with the record.\\nIf the ALJ finds that the claimant has not construc tively waived the right to\\nappear at the hearing , the ALJ may choose to proceed with the hearing,\\naccepting  the testimony  of the witness(es) and allowing  the appointed\\nrepresentative to quest ion the witness(es) and make arguments on the\\nclaimant’s behalf. The ALJ will advise the appointed representative that a\\nRequest to Show Cause for Failure to Appear will be sent to the claimant to\\nask why he or she did not appear at the scheduled hearing  and whether a\\nsupplemental hearing  should be held. After the 10-day  response period\\nexpires (with an additional five day s for mailing  time), the AL J will either:\\n•Determine that the claimant has constructively  waived his or her right\\nto appear for a hearing (if the claimant fails to respond to the Request\\nto Show Cause for Failure to Appear or fails to show good cause for\\nfailure to appear at the scheduled hearing ), and issue a decision based\\non the evidence of record; or\\n•Offer the claimant a supplemental hearing  to provide testimony  if the\\nclaimant establishes good cause for failure to appear at the scheduled\\nhearing .\\n6.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the claimant’s representative to question\\nwitnesses [ or inadequate time to question witnesses]  at the hearing .\\nApplicable law:  The regulation s unequivocally  provide that at the hearing\\nthe ALJ “may ask the witnesses any questions material to the issues and will\\n195\\nallow the parties or their desig nated repre sentatives to do so.” 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.950(e), 416.1540(e) (emphasis added). Permitting  the parties to do so is\\nthus not a matter of discretion. \\n7.The ALJ erred in not permitting  the witness to testify by [telephone or by\\nvideoconferencing ] as the witness was unable to testify  in person.\\n8.The ALJ erred in not calling  a witness (including  a medical or vocational\\nexpert) to appear for hearing  in person because telephone or video\\nteleconferencing  equipment was not available to conduct the appearance; or\\nuse of telephone or video teleconferencing  equipment would be less efficient\\nthan conducting  the appearance in person; or there are facts that provide a\\ngood reason to schedule this individual’s appearance in person.\\nApplic able law: The regulations at 20 C.F.R. § 404.950(e) provide the\\nfollowing  about witnesses: \\n(e) Witnesses at a hearing . Witnesses you call may appear at a hearing\\nwith you in the same manner in which you are scheduled to appear. If they\\nare unable to appear with you in the same manner as you, they may appear\\nas prescribed in § 404.936(c)( 4).

The regulations at 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.929, 416.1429 address\\nALJ hearing s and provide in pertinent part, that SSA “will schedule you to\\nappear by video teleconferencing  or in person.”61  The regulations further set\\n61 The regulations were amended, see 84 Fed. Reg. 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019)  which addressed “Setting the\\nManner for the Appe arance of Parties and Witnesses at a Hearing.”  This final rule became effective January\\n17, 2020, and modifies the time, place, and manner of appearance for hearings at the ALJ level of the\\nadministrative review process. The final rule states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing before an ALJ, and that the agency will set the time and place for the hearing accordingly. \\nParties to a hearing will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone.  Unde r this final rule, the agency will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the ability to\\nopt out of appearing by VTC at the ALJ hearings level. The revisions also provide that, at the ALJ hearing\\nlevel, if the agency needs to send an amended notice of hearing, or to schedule a supplemental hearing, the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing will be sent at least 20 days before the date of the hearing.\\nThe date of hearing indicated in the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing will be at least 75 days\\nfrom the date we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing unless the claimant has waived his or her right to\\nadvance notice.

A\\nfinding  that good cause exists to reschedule the time or place of your\\nhearing  will generally  not chang e the assig nment of the administrative law\\njudg e or how you or another party  will appear at the hearin g, unless we\\ndetermine a chang e will promote efficiency  in our hearing  process.\\n(1)The administrative law judg e will find good cause to change the time\\nor place of your hearing if he or she determines that, based on the\\nevidence:\\n(i) A serious physical or mental condition or incapacita ting injury\\nmakes it impossible for you or your representative to travel to the\\nhearing , or a death in the family  occurs; or\\n199\\n(ii) Severe weather conditions make it impossible for you or your\\nrepresentative to travel to the hearing .\\n(2)In determining  whether good cause exists in circumstances other than\\nthose set out in parag raph (f)(1) of this section, the administrative law\\njudge will consider your reason(s) for requesting  the chang e, the facts\\nsupporting  it, and the impact of the proposed chang e on the efficie nt\\nadministration of the hearing  process. Factors affecting  the impact of\\nthe chang e include, but are not limited to, the effect on the processing\\nof other scheduled hearing s, delays that might occur in rescheduling\\nyour hearing , and whether we previously  granted you any chang es in\\nthe time or place of your hearing . Examples of such other\\ncircumstances that you might give for requesting  a chang e in the time\\nor place of the hearing  include, but are not limited to, the following :\\n(i) You unsuccessfully  attempted to obtain a representativ e and\\nneed additional time to secure representation;\\n(ii) Your  representative was appointed within 30 days of the\\nscheduled hearing  and needs additional  time to prepare for the\\nhearing ;\\n(iii) Your representative has a prior commitment to be in court or\\nat another administrative hearing  on the date scheduled for the\\nhearing ;\\n(iv) A witness who will testify  to facts material to your case would\\nbe unavailable to attend the scheduled hearing  and the evidence\\ncannot be otherwise obtained;\\n(v) Transportation is not readily  available for you to travel to the\\nhearing ; or\\n(vi) You are unrepresented, and you are unable to respond to the\\nnotice of hearing  because of any physical, mental, educational, or\\nlinguistic limitations  (including  any lack of facility  with the\\nEnglish lang uage) which y ou may  have.\\n15.As the ALJ who conducted the hearing  was not available to issue the  decision\\nand the new ALJ issued an unfavorable decision which, in part, rejected the\\nclaimant’s allegations of pain and other symptoms, the new ALJ erred in not\\nconducting  a hearing  to fully evaluate the claimant’s alleg ations as suggested\\nin HAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B) discusses the circumstance when the\\nALJ who conducted the hearing  is not available to issue the decision, stating :\\nExcept in the limited circumstances outlined in HAL LEX I-2-8-40 C\\nbelow, the HOCAL J will reassig n a case, on a rotational basis, to another\\nALJ when the ALJ who conducted the hearing  is unavailable to issue a\\ndecision.  The ALJ to whom the case is reassig ned will review all the\\nevidence of record, including  the audio recording  of the hearing  (see\\n200\\nHAL LEX I -2-6-40 for more information about hearing  recording s). \\nIf the reassigned ALJ intends to issue a fully  favorable decision after\\nreviewing  the record and the audio recording , the ALJ need not conduct\\nanother hearing  and will issue a decision.  However, if the ALJ intends to\\nissue a less than fully  favorab le decision based on the information before\\nhim or her, or the ALJ requires more information to make a decision, the\\nALJ will assess whether another hearing  is necessary .  For example, the\\nALJ may find anoth er hearing  is necessary  if relevant expert evidence is\\nneeded but was not obtained at the hearing, or the ALJ needs additional\\ntestimony  to fully  evaluate a claimant’s allegations of pain and other\\nsymptoms.\\nIf the ALJ holds a new hearing , the ALJ will consider all pertinent\\ndocumentary  evidence admitted into the record at the prior hearing , the\\noral testimony  at the prior heari ng, and the evidence and testimony\\nadduced at the new hearing  when making  a decision.\\n16.The decision was not signed by the ALJ who held the hearing , and the\\ndocumentation required by HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B ) is not included in the \\nrecord.\\nApplicab le law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-40(B ) specifies that the HOCAL J can sign a\\ndraft decision and any associated orders written by an unavailable ALJ.  “Any\\nsuch written authoriz ation must be associated with the claim(s) file and must\\ninclude the following  affirmative statements” from the unavailable AL J:\\n•The AL J has read the decision and any  associated order;\\n•The ALJ concurs with the decision (and any associated order) as written\\nor concurs with the decision (and any associ ated order) with specified\\nchang es previousl y reviewed and approved by the ALJ before\\nauthoriz ation; and \\n•HOCAL J (NAME)’ is authoriz ed to sign the decision and any associated\\norder on the AL J’s behalf.\\nHAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).  In addition, \\nThe ALJ may give written authoriz ation via email, fax, or any other\\nwriting . However, unless the authoriz ation is provided throu gh an official\\nagency  email, the ALJ must sign the written authorization with his or her\\n‘wet’ sig nature (facsimile transmission is accepted).  The ALJ may not use\\na rubber stamp or other mechanical signature.  A HOCAL J may not use\\nthis procedure on his or her own initiative without specific written\\nauthoriz ation from the AL J.\\n201\\nHAL LEX I -2-8-40(B ).\\n17.The Appeals Council should remand this case for a de novo hearing  as the\\nhearing  recording  is incomplete [ or lost] .\\nApplicable law:  The Social Security  Act requires that all decisions of the\\nAppeals Council be based upon “the evidence adduced at the hearing .” 42\\nU.S.C. § 405(b).  The regulations further require that the Appeals Council\\nreview all the evidence in the hearing  record.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.976(b),\\n416.1476(b).\\nHAL LEX I -3-7-14(F ) provides that:\\nWhen the AC is considering  a request for review and finds that a claim(s)\\nfile is missing , or that a hearing  recording is lost or inaudible, it will first\\nfollow the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation Law\\n(HAL LEX) manua l I-3-1-12 and I-3-1-23. If the AC is unsuccessful in\\nresolving  the issue, it will grant the request for review and remand the\\ncase.\\nE.RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION63\\n1.The ALJ did not comply  with HAL LEX I-2-1-80 in advising  the claimant\\nregarding  his/her rig ht to representation.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-1-80(B )(1) addresses the advisement of the\\nright to representation at an administrative law judge hearin g and states that\\nwhile “[a]n ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee is not required to recite specific\\nquestions regarding  the right to representation  or the claimant’s capacity  to\\nmake an informed choice about representation,” it sets forth “example s of\\nquestions the ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee could ask an unrepresented claimant\\non the record” which include:\\n•Did you receive the hearing  acknowledg ment letter and its\\nenclosure(s)?\\n•Do you understand the information contained in that letter, specifically\\nconcerning  representation?  \\nPursuant to HAL LEX I-2-1-80(A)(1) & (2), if a pre-hearing  conference\\n(“PHC”) or pre-hearing  development conference (“PHDC”) was held prior to\\nthe hearing , “the ALJ or authoriz ed desig nee must advise the claimant of the\\nright to representation during  that PHC” and document  “that the claimant was\\nadvised of the rig ht to representation.”\\n63 Some circuits have more favorable policies regarding right to counsel than those in the HAL LEX.\\n202\\nAt a hearing , if the claimant did not have a PHC or PHDC, the ALJ is not\\nrequired to ask the claimant any specific questions regarding  the right to\\nrepresentation.  The AL J may  ask the following  questions:\\n•Did you recei ve the hearing  acknowledg ment letter and its\\nenclosure(s)?\\n•Do you understand the information contained in that letter, specifically\\nconcerning  representation?  \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1) (citing  HAL LEX I -2-1-80(A)(2)).\\nThe ALJ may also communicate to the claimant the following  information, or\\nask the claimant other questions:\\n•There is no requirement that the claimant obtain a representative.\\n•If the claimant does not appoint a representative, SSA will make every\\nreasonable effort to obtain all relevant medical and non-medic al\\nrecords.\\n•The benefits of appointing  a representative include having the\\nrepresentative obtain evidence, prepare for procee dings before SSA,\\ndevelop the claimant’s claim(s), and present the claim(s) in an\\nadministrative hearing . If the claimant is unrepresented, an ALJ will\\nquestion the claimant at the hearing .\\n•If the claimant wishes to obtain a representat ive, he or she should\\nbegin the process of finding  a representative as soon as possible.\\n•Some representatives may charge a fee, but there are also legal service\\norganizations that may  represent the claimant free of charg e.\\n•If the claimant seeks to reschedule the hearing  to obtain a\\nrepresentative, an ALJ may deny the claimant’s request unless there is\\ngood cause.\\n•The claimant must affirm that he or she understands the information\\nexplained to him or her reg arding  the rig ht to representation.\\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1).  \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-80(B )(1) further provides that: \\nAn ALJ must ensure that the claiman t is aware of his or her options for\\nrepresentation.  Specifically , an ALJ will explain the availability  of both\\nfree legal services and conting ency representation, and discuss access to\\n203\\norganizations that assist individuals in obtaini ng representation.  An ALJ\\nwill answer any questions the claimant may have, including  explaining  the\\nclaimant’s options regarding  representation, as outlined in the\\nacknowledg ment letter. However, the ALJ will answer any questions in a\\nmanner that neither encourag es nor discourag es representation. \\nIf the claimant decides to waive the right to representation , the ALJ must\\ndetermine whether the claimant is capable of making  an informed choice\\nto waive the right to representati on. If the ALJ is satisfied that the\\nclaimant can make an informed decision, the ALJ must secure from the\\nclaimant a verbal waiver on-the-record or a written waiver,  which will be\\nmarked as an exhibit.  If the claimant requests to postpone the hearing  to\\nobtain a representative, the ALJ must consider the totality  of\\ncircumstances and decide on-the-record whether to grant the claimant’s\\nrequest for postponement.\\n2.The ALJ erred in not postponing  the hearing  to allow the claimant to obtain\\nrepresentation.\\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-1-80(B )(2) addresses postponement of the\\nhearing  to obtain representation and states:\\na.If the “record does not show that the claimant was previously\\ninformed of the right to representation at a PHC or PHDC,” and “the\\nclaimant requests postponement of the hearing  to obtain a\\nrepresentative, and it is the first request, an ALJ will typically  grant\\nthe requested postponement.”\\nb.“If the record shows that the claimant, during  either a PHC or PHDC,\\nwas previously  informed of the right to representation . . . the ALJ\\nmay deny  any request for postponement to obtain a representative.”\\nc.“However, the ALJ must consider the totality  of the circumstances\\nincluding any mental limitations that impair the claimant’s\\nunderstanding  regarding  the right to representation or any other factors\\nthat may indicate good cause (see, e.g., Social Security  Ruling  91-5p ,\\nTitles II and XVI: Mental Incapacity  and Good Cause for Missing the\\nDeadline to Request Review and HAL LEX I-2-0-60 for factors to\\nconsider when determi ning if there is ‘good cause’).  For example, an\\nALJ may be more likely  to grant a postponement when a claimant has\\nan intellectual disability  that prevented him or her from  understanding\\nthe right to representation.  An ALJ may also consider that the\\nclaimant made a good faith effort to obtain a representative but was\\nunable to find a representative willing to accept appointment.\\nHowever, in all cases, the ALJ will consider  the totality  of the\\ncircumstances in deciding  whether to grant a postponement.  If the\\nALJ denies the request for a postponement, the ALJ will explain to the\\n204\\nclaimant on-the-record at the hearing  the reasons for denying the\\nrequest.” \\nd.“If an ALJ grants postponement to obtain a representati ve, the ALJ\\nwill:\\n•Confirm that the claimant has been advised of the right to\\nrepresentation (following  the procedures in A.2.a or B .1. above); \\n•Give the claimant information about organizations that provi de\\nfree legal services, unless the claimant has indicated he or she\\nalready  has a representative in mind and the representative has\\nagreed to take the case; \\n•Advise the claimant to notify  the HO if representation is obtained;\\n \\n•Advis e the claimant that he or she will receive notification of the\\nnew hearing  date and time;\\n•Advise the claimant that normally  only one postponement is\\npermitted to obtain representation, unless there is g ood cause; \\n•Advise the claimant that if he or she appears at the rescheduled\\nhearing  without a representative, the hearing  will procee d without\\nthe representative, unless there is g ood cause; and \\n•Obtain from the claimant a signed “Acknowle dgment of\\nPostponement in Order to Obtain Representation” (HO staff will\\nexhibit the acknowledg ment letter and provide a copy to the\\nclaimant).”\\nF. RES JUDICAT A  \\n1.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that res judicata applies as the\\nfacts and/or issues are not the same as those in the prior determination.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that res judicata applies when there\\nare the same facts and issues and there has been a final prior determination. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.957(c)(1), 416.1457(c)(1) . This regulation provides that res\\njudicata applies when:\\nwe have made a previous determination or decision under this subpart\\nabout your rights on the same facts and on the same issue or issues, and\\nthis previous determination has become final by either administrative or\\njudicial action.\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n205\\n2.  Given the existence of new and mater ial evidence, the ALJ’s finding of res \\njudicata cannot be sustained.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 68-12a notes the regulations indicate “that res judicata\\nshould be applied, among  other condition s not present here, only ‘on the same\\nfacts’”– a circumstance the hearing examiner had impliedly  conceded.64\\nAccording ly, where new and materi al evidence is presently  of record, “res\\njudicata may not be applied thereto, and the claimant may now be entitled to a\\nfavorable finding  on an issue previously  decided ag ainst him[ .]”\\nThe term “same material facts”  is addressed in HAL LEX 1-2-4-40 J, “Same\\nMaterial F acts -- No New and Material Evidence”:\\nThe term same material facts” means, in effect, that no new and material\\nevidence has been submitted since the last adjudicatio n on the prior claim.\\nThe ALJ will follow the procedures in Hearing s, Appeals and Litigation\\nLaw (HALLEX) manual I-2-9-40 C to determine whether additional\\nevidence is new and mate rial. If, in connection with the current claim, the\\nclaimant submits  evidence that meets the regulatory  standard for new and\\n64 SSR 68-12a originated from the Appe als Council’s review of a case on its own motion.  The claimant had\\nfirst filed an application for benefits based on a back injury and headaches. No review was requested after\\nthat application was denied initially.  The claimant then filed a new application, adding that he had heart\\ntrouble.  This claim was also denied and no further review requested.  Finally, the claimant filed a third\\napplication, again alleging disability due to a back injury.  All three applications alleged the same date of\\nonset.  After the final claim was denied initially and upon reconsideration, the claimant requested a hearing\\nbefore a hearing examiner.  The hearing examiner apparently determined that, in addition to the doctrine of\\nadministrative finality barring a finding of disability in regard to initial determinations on prior applications\\nthat had become “final and binding,” any finding of entitlement was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.\\nThe Appe als Council disagreed and held that, although reopening of the initial determination was precluded\\nsince more than 4 years had elapsed before new and material evidence was submitted with the subsequent\\napplication, a determination of entitlement to a period of disability and disability insurance benefits based\\non that subsequent application was not precluded by res judicata as the determination need not be based on\\nthe same facts pertinent to the same issue as the prior unfavorable determination.  The hearing examiner’s\\nfinding of non-disability was determined to be contrary to the evidence. Despite carefully studying the\\nevidence, the Appe als Council failed “to find credible medical evidence to the effect that the claimant’s\\nimpairments were in fact remediable, or that even after completion of the recommended surgery that the\\nattending physicians ever declared him able to return to substantial gainful activity at any reasonably\\ndeterminable time in the future.”  To the contrary:\\nthere was virtually an unanimity of opinion, both lay and medical, that rehabilitation was not feasible\\nand that he could not be successfully placed in any of the available work programs.  It is\\nconvincingly shown that, in spite of what appeared to be competent medical supervision over a long\\nperiod of time, the claimant’s physical status continued to deteriorate.  His impairments have\\ncontinued undiminished over a span of about 9 years and there is no persuasive evidence that any\\nsignificant improvement may reasonably be expected.\\nThus, the claimant was deemed entitled to benefits based on the new application and awarded benefits\\nbeginning with the twelfth month bef ore the month in which he f iled the application.\\n206\\nmaterial evidence,  the facts are not the same and administrative res\\njudicata would not apply .\\nNOTE:  To evaluate whether evidence meets the regulatory  standard for\\nnew and material evidence, the ALJ must know what evidence was used to\\nmake the prior decision. According ly, the ALJ may need to obtain the\\nprior claim file to review that evidence.\\nTo determine whether the “same material facts” exist, a hearing may need\\nto be held: HAL LEX 1-2-4-40 M, When a Hearing is Needed to\\nDetermine Whether There is New and Material Evidence - An ALJ may\\nschedule a limited hearing  if there is indication that testimony  from the\\nclaimant, the treating  physician, or some other witness might constitute\\nnew and material evidence under HALLEX I-2-9-40 C. In this situation,\\nthe following  procedures apply :\\n1.Include the following  in the Notice of Hearing :\\na. A reference to the prior application,\\nb. A statement that a hearing will be held to ascertain whether\\nadditional testimony will warrant revision of the prior\\ndetermination or decision, and\\nc.A statement that if the additional testimony  does not warrant\\nrevision of the prior determination or decision, the current  RH will\\nbe dismissed on the basis of administrative res judicata.\\n2.If, after the hearing , the ALJ finds that there is no new and material\\nevidence (as defined in HAL LEX I-2-9-40 C) or other basis for\\nreopening  the prior determination or decision, the ALJ should dismiss\\nthe request for a hearing  and include in the dismissal order a\\ndiscussion of the testimony  at the hearing  and the AL J’s rationale.\\n3.The ALJ erred in apply ing the doctrine of administrative finality  to find that\\nthe claimant’s claim was barred when it did not apply  to the facts and\\ncircumstances of this case g iven the ex istence of new and material evidence.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 68-12a, even in cases where the prior\\ndetermi nations have become final, res judicata does not apply  where the\\nrecord presently contains new and material evidence. SSR 68-12a emphasiz es\\nthat the concept of res judicata should not be confused “with the rules of\\nadministrative finality  . . ., which . . . merely  precl ude the reopening  of a prior\\nunfavorable  decision under an earlier application where the initial\\nadministrative denial thereof was more than 4 years from the filing  date of the\\ncurrent application.” It explains that “even thoug h -- as in the instant case --\\nthe lapse of time may prevent the reopening of prior determinations to the\\ncontra ry” a claimant may still be entitled to a finding  of disability  based on\\nnew and material evidence.\\nHAL LEX I-2-4-40 addresses administrative res judicata and explains the \\n207\\ndifference betwe en res judicata and administrative res judicata and sets forth\\nwhen administrative res judicata does not apply .  This section  provides:\\nA. General\\nThis section explains administrative res judicata as it applies to decisions\\nunder the Social Security  Act (Act). When a prior determination  or\\ndecision with respect to the same party , facts, and issue(s) has become\\nadministratively  final, the doctrine of administrative res judicata may be\\nused to dismiss a request for hearing  (RH) entirely  or to refuse to consid er\\nan issue(s) on a subsequent application arising from the same title of the\\nAct. The purpose of administrati ve res judicata is to protect the Social\\nSecurity Administration (SSA) from having  to repeatedly  consider a claim\\nthat has been finally  decided. See Prog ram Operations Manual System GN\\n03101.160.\\nB. Application of  Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe regulations at 20 CFR 404.947(c)(1) and 416.1457(c)(1) provide that\\nadministrative res judicata ex ists when:\\n1.There has been a previous determination or decision under the same\\nsubpart with respect to the same party ;\\n2.The previous determination or decision was based on the same facts\\nand on the same issue(s); and\\n3.The previous determination or decision has become final by either\\nadministrative or judici al action. The regulations allow an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) to dismiss an RH on the basis of\\nadministrative res judicata. Altho ugh such dismissal is discretionary ,\\nan ALJ should apply  the doctrine of res judicata when the requisite\\nconditions are met. It is possible to dismi ss one or more issues on the\\nbasis of administrative res judicata and still render a decision on other\\nissues.\\n4.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that administrative res judicata\\napplies as there has been a chang e in a specific section in the Listing  of\\nImpairments.\\n5.The ALJ committed reversible error in finding  that administrative res judicata\\napplies as the prior determination was not administratively  final because the\\nclaimant lacked mental competency  to appeal the prior determination.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-2-4-40, addressing  “Administrative Res\\nJudicata,” provides:\\nC. When Adm inistrative Res Judicata is Not Applicable  - \\nAdministrative res judicata does not apply  when there has been a chang e\\n208\\nin issues; for example, when there has been a change in a specific section\\nin the Listing  of Impairments  (listing s); or when the prior determination is\\nnot administratively  final (e.g., the claimant lacked mental competency  to\\nappe al the prior determination, or the claimant was provided with\\nincorrect, incomplete, or misleading  information about when and how to\\nrequest administrative review).\\nD.

An issue at your\\nhearing  may be a fact that has already  been decided in one of our previous\\ndeterminations or decisions in a claim involving  the same parties, but\\narising under a different title of the Act or under the Federal Coal Mine\\nHealth and Safety  Act.  If this happens, the administrative law judge will\\nnot consider the issue again, but will accept the factual finding  made in the\\nprevious determination or decision unless there are reasons to believe that\\nit was wrong .\\nEM-24033, effective July 13, 2024, announces SSA’s chang e of position on\\nthe use of collateral estoppel to adopt prior disability  determinations and\\ndecisions. It provides guidance on how this new policy will be applied to\\npotential collateral estoppel claims currently  pending  at various listed agency\\noffices.\\nThe EM states: \\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of\\ndisability  in a subsequent claim by the same individual for a different\\ndisability  benefit or SSI payments if, in our prior final determination or\\ndecision, we have already  decided that the individual is disable d for the\\nperiod in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1. Both the prior determination or decision  and new claim require\\napplication of the same statutory  definition of disability .\\n2. We have not made an intervening  medica l determination or decision\\nfinding  that the individual’s disability  ceased.\\n3. The individual has not engaged in substantial gainful activity  since the\\nprior established onset date (EOD). \\n4. The EOD in the prior claim is on or before the date when the\\nnonmedical requirements for entitlement are last met in the new claim.\\n213\\n5. The record with the prior favorable disability determination or\\ndecision is not in terminated status.\\n6. We do not have reason to believe that the prior disability\\ndetermination or decision was wrong .\\nThe new policy applies to subsequent claims and appeals filed on or after\\nthe effective date; to initial claims and appeals pending  as of the effec tive\\ndate; and to closed claims in which SSA or the claimant “ques tioned the\\nagency ’s prior final determination or decision in writing ” within one year\\nof the date of the notice of the initial determination.\\n“Questioning  the determination or decision in writing ” occurs when\\nclaimant files a subsequent claim for the same benefit alleg ing an onset\\ndate within the period adjudic ated by the prior determination or decision;\\nor claimant otherwise indicates in writing  that they disagree with the\\ndetermination or decision; or SSA indicates in writing  that it is\\nconsidering  reopening  and revising  the determination or decision.\\nTo meet the one-year requirement a subsequent application, other written\\nrequest for reopening  (express or implied), or other written expression of\\ndisag reement with the prior determination or decision must be made\\nwithin one year of the date of the notice of the initial determination; and\\nthe questioning  must either occur after or be pending  a response from SSA\\nas of the effective date.\\nA subsequent claim for a previously  denied benefit is considere d an\\nimplied request to reopen the prior determination  or decision when the\\nclaimant alleg es an onset date of disability  within the previously\\nadjudicat ed period. In such cases, the subsequent claim satisfies the\\nsecond claim criterion if filed within one year of the date of the notice of\\nthe initial determination associated with the prior final determination or\\ndecision.\\nSee also updates to POMS DI 11011 TN 5 and POMS DI 27515 TN 12\\nexplaining  how SSA employ ees must implement these chang es. \\nH.

LATE FILING OF THE REQUEST FOR RE VIEW66\\n1.The Appeals Council should find good cause, as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.911, 416.1511 for the claimant’s late filing  of his/her Request for Review.\\nApplicable law :  20 C.F .R. § 404.968(b) states:\\nExtension of time to request review .  You or any party to a hearing\\ndecision may ask that the time for filing a request for the review be\\nextended.  The request for an extension of time must be in writing .  It\\nmust be filed with the Appeals Council, and it must give the reasons why\\nthe request for review was not filed within the stated time period.  If you\\nshow that you had good cause for missing  the deadline, the time period\\nwill be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the\\nstandards ex plained in § 404.911.\\nSee also 20 C.F .R. § 416.1482 (same).\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911(a), 416.1311 provide that in determining  whether a\\nclaimant has shown good cause for missing  a deadline to request review, SSA\\nconsiders:  (1) what circumstan ces kept the claimant from making  the request\\non time; (2) whether SSA’s actions misled the claimant; (3) whether the\\nclaimant did not understand “the requirements of the Act resulting  from\\namendments to the Act, other  legislation, or court decisions;” and (4) whether\\nthe claimant had any “phy sical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitations\\n(including  any lack of facility  with the English language)” which prevented\\nhim/her from filing  a timely  request or from understanding  or knowing  about\\nthe need to file a timely  request for review. Id. See also  20 C.F.R. §\\n416.1411(b) (same).\\nThis regulation further sets forth examples in determining  whether  a claimant\\nhas shown to have “good cause for missing  a deadline to request review”\\nwhich include the following :\\n66 Requests for extensions of time submitted before a civil action is filed are governed by HALLEX I-3-9-\\n92(B), which also states that such requests must include a good cause reason for requesting the extension. \\n“If the claimant or appointed representative does not provide a good cause reason for requesting an\\n[extension], the AC will deny the request.”  Id.  The Appe als Council follows the good cause standards set\\nforth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 405.20, and 416.1411.  Any delay in the Appe als Council’s response to the\\nextension “request is not a factor the AC considers in determining whether good cause exists for not filing\\na civil action within the stated time.”  HALLEX I-3-9-92(B) (Note).  Further, when an extension is granted,\\nthe AC “will generally provide up to 30 days from the date of the notice granting the [extension] (or, if more\\nappro priate, up to 30 days from the date of the civil action filing deadline) to file a civil action,” although the\\nAppe als Council “may grant more or less time depending on the circumstances of the individual case.” \\nHAL LEX I-3-9-92(B) .  However, when the Appe als Council denies the extension request, the “AC will\\ninclude in the notice a sufficient rationale explaining its finding that there is not a good cause reason to extend\\nthe time to file a civil action.”  Id.\\n217\\n(1)You were seriously  ill and were prevented from contacting  us in\\nperson, in writing , or throug h a friend, relative, or other person.\\n(2)There was a death or serious illness in y our immediate family .\\n(3)Important  records were destroy ed or damag ed by fire or other\\naccidental cause.\\n(4)You were trying very hard to find necessary information to support\\nyour claim but did not find the information within the stated time\\nperiods.\\n(5)You asked us for addit ional information explaining  our action within\\nthe time limit, and within 60 days of receiving  the explanation you\\nrequested reconsideration or a hearing, or within 30 days of receiving\\nthe explanation you requested Appeal Council review or filed a civil\\nsuit.\\n(6)We gave you incorrect or incomplete information about when and how\\nto request administrative review or to file a civil suit.\\n(7)You did not receive notice of the determination or decision.\\n(8)You sent the request to another Government agency  in good faith\\nwithin the time limit and the request did not reach us until after the\\ntime period had ex pired.\\n(9)Unusual or unavoidable circumstances exist, including  the\\ncircumstances descri bed in parag raph (a)(4) of this section, which\\nshow that you could not have known of the need to file timely , or\\nwhich prevented y ou from filing  timely .\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.911(b), 416.1411(b).\\n2.The claimant’s failure to timely  request review should be excused in light of\\nhis/her mental impairments as discussed in SSR 91-5p.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 91-5p discusses the procedure SSA follows in cases\\nwhere a claimant fails to make  a timely  request for review but may have good\\ncause for failing  to do so due to mental incapacity . The Ruling explains that\\nSSA policy  has never been to consider failure to timely  request review as an\\nautomatic g round for dismissing  the appeal.\\nWhere claimants present evidence of mental incapacity  that may have\\nprevented an understanding  of the review process, SSA will consider whether\\ngood cause exists for extending  the time for requesting  review without regard\\nto how much time has passed. SSR 91-5p acknowledg es that 20 C.F.R. §\\n218\\n404.911 specifies, in essentially  the same lang uage as § 416.1411(a), the\\nfactors considered in determining  whether a claimant has shown good cause\\nfor missing  a deadline to request review.\\nPursuant to SSR 91-5p, adjudi cators must resolve reasonable doubts in favor\\nof a claimant and, while basing  the decision on all pertinent facts, must\\nconsider four factors in determining  whether “a claimant lacked the mental\\ncapacity  to understand the procedures for requesting  review”: \\n•inability  to read or write;\\n•lack of facility  with the Eng lish lang uage;\\n•limited education; or\\n•any menta l or physical condition which limits the claimant’s ability  to\\ndo thing s for him/herself.\\nSSR 91-5 explains that where claimants present evidence of mental incapacity\\nthat may  have prevented an understanding  of the review process, SSA will\\nconsider whether good cause exists for extending  the time for requesting\\nreview without regard to how much time has passed.  The decision regarding\\nmental incapacity  is to be “based on all the pertinent facts in a particular\\ncase.”\\nA finding  of good cause will result in an extensio n of time for requesting\\nreview and the adjudicator will “take the action which would have been\\nappr opriate had the claimant filed a timely  request for review.”  SSR 91-5p\\nmandates that if good cause is determined to exist, the adjudicator “will\\nextend the time for requesting  review and take the action which would have\\nbeen appropriate had the claimant filed a timely  request for review.”  Thus,\\nwhere good cause exists, the adjudicator does not have discretion and must\\ngrant the ex tension.\\nIf, on the other hand, the adjudicator decides good cause is absent, the request\\nfor extension of time will be denied and the request for review dismissed. \\nThe adjudicator is to provide a rationale for not finding  good cause and notify\\nthe claimant that a new application may  be filed using the date of the written\\nrequest for review as a protective filing  date.\\nSSR 91-5p provides that where any of the four factors (inability  to read or\\nwrite; lack of facility  with the English lang uage; limited educ ation; any\\nmental or physical condition which limits the claimant’s ability to do thing s\\nfor him/herself) are present and the claimant is unrepresented, the adjudicator\\nis to assist the claimant in obtaining  relevant evidence bearing  upon mental\\nincapacity .\\nSSR 91-5p specifies the adjudicator is to provide a rationale for not finding\\ngood cause and notify  the claimant that a new application may  be filed usin g\\nthe date of the written request for review as a protective filing  date.\\n219\\nHAL LEX 1-2-4-40, addressing  res judicata, provides\\nE. Mental Competence -- Prior Determination Not Admini stratively  Final\\nand Administrative Res Judicata Not Applicable - When an ALJ\\nAddresses Mental Competence- An ALJ must address and resolve in the\\ndecision or dismissal the issue of whether a claimant lacked the mental\\ncompetence to pursue the appeal when:\\n•The ALJ considers the application of administrative finality  or\\nadministrative res judicata to a determination or decision made on\\na prior application;\\n• There is evidence that a claimant lacked the mental capacity  to\\ntimely  request review of an adverse determination, decision,\\ndismissal, or review by  a federal district court; and\\n• The claimant had no one legally responsible for prosecuting the\\nclaim.\\nIf the claimant satisfies the substantive criteria, the time limits in the\\nreopening  regulations do not apply. In that situation, regardless of how much\\ntime has passed since the prior administrative action, the claimant can\\nestablish good cause for extending  the deadline to request review of that\\naction. If the ALJ finds that good cause exists, he or she will extend the time\\nfor requesting  review and take the action that would have been appro priate\\nhad the claimant filed a timely  appeal. In that instance, administrative finality\\nand administrative res judicata will not apply .\\nJ. HEARING S BEFORE THE APPE ALS CO UNCIL\\n1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral \\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n2.The Appeals Council erred by failing  to notify  claimant and his/her\\nrepresentativ e that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\nApplicable law: 20 CFR § 404.976 address procedures before  the Appeals\\nCouncil on review and provides in pertinent part:\\n(b) Oral argument. You may request to appear before the Appeals Council\\nto present oral argument. The Appeals Council will grant your request if it\\ndecides that your case raises an important question of law or policy  or that\\noral argument would help to reach a proper decision. If your request to\\nappear is granted, the Appeal s Council will tell you the time and place of\\n220\\nthe oral argument at least 10 business days before the scheduled date. You\\nwill appear before the Appeals Council by video teleconferencing  or in\\nperson, or, when the circumstances described in § 404.936(c)(2) exist, we\\nmay schedule you to appear by telephone. The Appeals Council will\\ndetermine whether any other person relevant to the proceeding  will appear\\nby video teleconferencing , telephone, or in person as based on the\\ncircumstances described in § 404.936(c)(4).\\nNOTE:\\nIf oral argument at the Appeals Council level is scheduled by video\\nteleconferencing , the rule does not provide for the claimant to opt out of\\nvideo teleconferencing  in favor of in person oral argument, as is permitted\\nunder the rules applicable to the AL J hearing  level.\\nSee also HAL LEX I-3-8-12 , Request for Appearance —  when the\\nAppeals Council (AC) grants a request for review or reviews an ALJ\\ndecision or order of dismissal on its own motion and sends a separate\\nnotice of review with its propo sed final action, the AC will notify  the\\nclaimant and any representative that they may request an appearance\\nbefore the AC to present oral argument.  The  AC will grant a request for\\nan appearance if it determined that:\\n•an important question of law or policy  is presented; or\\n•oral argument would benefit the AC in rendering a proper decision\\nin the case.  \\n3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issue d a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nApplicable Law: Unde r a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA\\nrevised its rules to clarify  when and how administrative appe als judges (AAJ )\\non the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisio ns. See Hearings\\nHeld by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 Fed. Reg.\\n73138 (Nov. 16, 2020).  Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the\\nauthority  to hold hearing s and issue decisions under the existing statute and\\nregulations, but SSA had not exercised this authority  or explained the\\ncircumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals Council to\\nassume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\n221\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Removal of a hearing request(s) to the\\nAppeals Council)  provides that the “Appeals Council  may assume\\nresponsibility  for a hearing request(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the\\nadministrative review process” and requires sending  a “notice to all parties\\nthat the Appeals Counc il has assumed responsibility  for the case(s).” The\\nAppeals Council is required to cond uct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961 , applicable to SSDI  claims and 416.1429\\nthrough 416.1461, applicable to SSI claims.

The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judg e\\nwho conducted a hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismis sed a hearing\\nrequest will not participate  in any action associated with the request for\\nAppeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456. \\nK.SUBMISSIO N OF NE W EVIDENCE  TO THE APPE ALS\\nCOUNCIL\\n1.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers]  warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decisio n and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n2.Even thoug h the eviden ce is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***] and there is good cause for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable probability  that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decis ion, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\nApplicable law:  SSR 17-4p notes that the Appeals Council will not obtain or\\nevaluate additional  evidence unless (1) “one of the circumstances listed in 20\\nCFR 404.970( b) or 416.1470(b) applies and the individual or his or her\\nreprese ntative shows that the evidence is related to the period on or before the\\ndate of the hearing  level decision”; or (2) “the claim is a title XVI claim that\\nis not based on an application for benefits (e.g ., an ag e-18 redetermination).” \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970(b), 416.1570(b) sets forth the circumstances under\\nwhich the Appeals Council will review a case.

HAL LEX I-3-3-6(B ) states, in part:\\nGenerally , the AC will only consider additional evidence as a basis for\\ngranting  review if the claimant meets one of the good cause exceptions\\nset forth in 20 C.F.R. 404.970(b) and 416.1470(b); the additional\\nevidence is new, material, and relates to the period on or before the\\ndate of the hearing  decision; and there is a reasonable proba bility that\\nthe additional evidence will chang e the outcome of the decision . . ..\\nNOTE 1:\\nThe AC has broad discretion when evaluat ing whether a claimant\\nmeets a good cause exception.  However, the AC will not infer good\\ncause for missing  the deadline to timely  submit evidence solely\\nbecause a claimant  is unrepresented.  When an unrepresented claimant\\n223\\nsubmits additional evidence, the AC will consider all factors present in\\nthe record and any  statements from the claimant. . . . \\nNOTE 2:\\nThe AC will determine that the claimant actively  and dilig ently  soug ht\\nevidence from a source when any evidence suggests that the\\ndocuments were timely  requested.  The AC will not investig ate the\\nissue or require a showing  of proof that the claimant actively  and\\ndilig ently  soug ht the evidence. . . .\\n2.  New, Material, and Relates to the Period On or Before the\\nHearing Decision\\nAdditional evidence is new if it is not part of the claim(s) file as of the\\ndate of the hearing  decision.\\nAdditional  evidence is material if it is relevant, i.e., involves or is\\ndirectly  related to issues adjudicated by  the AL J.\\nAdditional evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision if the evidence is dated on or before the date of the\\nhearing decision, or the evidence post-dates the hearing  decision but is\\nreasonably  related to the time period adjudicated in the hearing\\ndecision.\\nNOTE:\\nThe AC does not apply  a strict deadline when determining  whether\\npost-dated evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision.  There are circumstances when evidence  dated after\\nthe hearing decision relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nhearing  decision.  For example, a statement  may relate to the period on\\nor before the date of the hearing  decision when it postdates the\\ndecision but makes a direct reference to the time period adjudicated in\\nthe hearing decision.  This may be especially  important in a claim\\ninvolving  an expired date last insured (DLI) when a statement from  a\\nmedical source dated after the hearing  decision specifically  addresse s\\nthe time period before the DL I.\\nCommon examples of evidence that is not related to the period on or\\nbefore the date of the hearing  decision include evidence that shows:\\n•A worsening  of the condition after the expiration of a DLI in a title\\nII disability  insurance benefits claim.\\n•A worsening  of the condition after  the last day of the prescribed\\nperiod in a widow(er)’s insura nce benefits claim based on\\ndisability .\\n•A worsening  of the condition after the claimant attained age 22 in\\n224\\na child’s insurance benefits claim based on disability .\\n•A worsening  of the condition or onset of a new condition after the\\ndate of the AL J decision.\\nAs set forth in HAL LEX I -3-2-15(A), claimants:\\n. . . must inform or submit to the Social Security  Administration\\n(SSA) all evidence, in its entirety , known to him or her that relates\\nto whether or not he or she is blind or disabled.  See 20 C.F.R.\\n404.1512 and 416.912. If a claimant has a representative, then the\\nrepresentative must help the claimant obtain the information or\\nevidence that the claimant must submit.

Kelly , 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and to\\nreview addit ional materials and evidence, will be satisfied as part of the new\\nhearing  before the Administrative Law Judge.”  Under HAL LEX I-3-8-10,\\nNotice To Claimant When Granting  Request For Review, if the AC is\\nremanding  a case to an ALJ, issuing a fully favorable decision, or issuing  a\\ndecision that is favorable in part and remanding  the remaining  issue(s) for\\nfurth er proceeding s, the AC’s final action constitutes notice of review and the\\nAC is not required to send a separate notice of review before issuing  the final\\naction document.

However, when the AC grants\\nreview and proposes to issue an unfavorable decision, a partially  favorable\\ndecision (containing  unfavorable finding s), or to dismiss the request for\\nhearing , the AC must  issue a separate notice of review before taking  final\\naction. which will:\\n• State the reason(s) for the AC’s proposed action and the issue(s) to be\\nconsidered;\\n• Prov ide the claimant 30 days from the date of the notice to submit any\\nadditional evidence or written statement;\\n• Advise the claimant that they may request an appearance before the\\nAC; and\\n• When proffering  evidence, advise the claimant that they may request\\nthat the case be remanded to an AL J.\\nSee also HAL LEX I -3-9-84, Notice of Proposed Revision of Prior Decision.   \\nHAL LEX I-3-2-16 addresses proffering  evidence which is received by the\\nAppeals Council and  provides:\\nB. When the Appeals Council Proffers Evidence - Due to its appellate\\nfunction and the regulatory  standard for considering  additional evidence\\n(see 20 CFR 404.970 and 416.1470), the Appeals Counc il (AC) does not\\nproffer all evidence. The AC will proffer evidence that it receives from a\\nsource other than the claimant or the appointed representative, if any,\\nwhen that evidence is associated with the claim(s) file. The AC will not\\nproffer additional evidence when:\\n• The AC is using  the evidence to issue a fully  favorable decision;\\n•The evidence is for treatment of a common ailment (such as a cold\\nor the flu), and the AC finds it is reasonable to presume the ailment\\nis unrelated to the claimant’s alleg ed impairment(s) (i.e., the\\nevidence may be new and related to the period at issue, but it is not\\nmaterial as ex plained in HAL LEX I-3-3-6);\\n226\\n• The evidence is a list of prescribed medications (even when new,\\nmaterial and related to the period at issue);\\n• The evidence is substantively  the same as other evidence already\\nin the record (e.g., a nurse’s note duplica ting a doctor’s note that is\\nalready  part of the record); or\\n• The evidence is a duplicate copy  of evidence already  in the record.\\nNOTE:\\nAdditionally , the AC will not proffer evidence when it remands a case,\\nbecause the AC does not exhibit additional evidence on remand. Rather,\\nthe administrative law judge (ALJ) provides the claimant the opportunity\\nto review the additional evidence (see HAL LEX I -2-1-35).\\nC. When the AC Offers a Supplemental Hearing\\nThe AC will offer a supplemen tal hearing  with proffered evidence when\\nthe AC intends to grant review and issue a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision. In that circumstance, the AC will advise the claimant that he or\\nshe may  request that the AC remand the case to an AL J for a new hearing .\\nD.Proffering  Procedures\\nTo proffer evidence, the AC sends a proffer notice to the claimant and\\nappointed representative, if any. In the notice, the AC will generally  give\\nthe claimant 30 days from the date of the notice to object to, comment on\\nor refute the evidence, or to submit any other written statement about the\\nfacts or law that the claimant believes apply  in light of the evidence\\nsubmitted. When applicable (see above), the AC will also tell the claimant\\nthat within 30 days, he or she may ask the AC to remand the case to an\\nALJ for a new hearing .\\nWhen the AC initiates own-motion review based on a protest from an\\neffectuat ing component or Regional Commissioner’s office, the AC must\\nproffer the protest memorandum to the claimant and representative, if any,\\nunless the AC intends to issue a fully  favorable decisio n (HALLEX I-3-6-\\n20 B.2). In these cases, the AC must mail a copy of the protest\\nmemorandum to the claimant and representative, if any .\\nIn all other cases, the AC may follow the following  procedures when\\nproffer is required:\\n• If the claimant is represented and the claim( s) file is electronic, the\\nproffer notice will inform the representative that the new evidence\\nis available for review throug h the Appointed Representativ e\\nServices (ARS) portal.\\n• If the claimant is unrepresented and has a MySSA account and the\\n227\\nclaim(s) file is electro nic, Office of Appellate Operations (OAO)\\nstaff will provide a copy  of the new evidence to the claimant’s\\nMySSA messag e center. The proffer notice will inform the\\nclaimant that the evide nce is available to review on their MySSA\\naccount.\\n• OAO staff will proffer a copy of the new evidence by mail to the\\nclaimant and representative, if any , when:\\n\\\" The claimant is represented, but the claiman t’s representative\\ndoes not have access to the ARS portal;\\n\\\" The claimant is unrepres ented and does not have a My SSA\\naccount; or\\n\\\" The claim(s) file is in paper format.\\nThe AC must be mindful of new evidence that may be offensive or\\ndetrimental to the claima nt’s health. When the claimant is represented, the AC\\nmay elect to proffer the evidence only to the representativ e and advise the\\nrepresentative to exercise discretion in deciding  whether to show the claimant\\nthe eviden ce. When the claimant is unrepresented, the AC may proffer the\\nevidence throug h the claimant’s servicing  field office (F O). \\n6.The Appeals Council failed to conside r the claimant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving  additional evidence, because the AC did not assoc iate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-3-5-50, Appeals Council Receives Additional\\nEvidence After I ssuing  Denial of Request for Review provides:\\nC. Reviewing  the Additional Evidence\\n1. Evidence Submitted but Not Asso ciated Prior to Date of Denial\\nNotice - Occasionally , a claimant will submi t additional evidence for\\nAC review before the AC releases its denial notice, but the evidence is\\nnot associated with the file until after the AC releases its denial notice.\\nIn these instances, the AC must consider the claimant’s request for\\nreview ag ain.\\n2. Evidence Submitted on or After Date of Denial Notice - If the\\nclaimant submits evidence on or after the date of the denial notice, the\\nAC will not vacate its denial of the request for review. Rather, the AC\\ntreats the submission of additional evidence as an implied request for\\nreopening  of the administrative law judg e’s decision. \\n7.The Appeals Council must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice. \\n228\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX 1-3-5-50, Appeals Council Receives Additional\\nEvidence After I ssuing  Denial of Request for Review provides:\\nD. Other Request for Exhibits, Hearing  Recording (s), or Extension of\\nTime Received but Not Associated Prior to Date of Denial Notice\\nThe AC may also receive a request for exhibits, a hearing  recording, or an\\nextension of time before it releases its denial notice but does not associate\\nthe request with the file until after it releases its denial notice. In these\\ninstances, the AC must vacate the prior denial to consider the claimant’s\\nrequest for review again after the claimant has had an opportunity  to\\nreview and comment.\\n8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request  for review because the\\nreview  denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\nApplicable law :  HAL LEX I -3-5-25(A) provides:\\nA. General\\nThe purpose of denial notices is to notify the claimant that the Appeals\\nCouncil (AC) has not found a basis for granting  review. The AC will not\\nuse a denial notice to make substantive finding s, chang e the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, make substitute finding s, or in any other way revise an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) decision. If the AC needs to amend,\\nmodify , or change the substance in an ALJ decision, it must grant the\\nrequest for review.\\n9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.9 11, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-3-1-14 addressed requests for an extension of\\ntime (EOT)  to submit evidence or arguments to the Appeals Council (AC) in\\nsupport of a request for review.  HAL LEX I-3-1-14(A) states that the AC will\\naccept an extension request either in writing  or by telephone.  For an EOT\\nrequest, “the AC provides the claimant or appointe d representative 25 days\\nfrom the date of the notice granting  the EOT, even if the claimant or\\nappointed representative requests an EOT for more than 25 day s.” Id. \\nThis HAL LEX explains that when a subsequent extension request is made,\\n“the AC will consider whether the claimant or appointed representative\\nprovided good cause for requesting  a subsequent EOT” and will use the\\nstandards set forth  in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911 and 416.1411.67 Id. The Appeals\\n67see pages 212- 13, supra  for a discussion 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.131. \\n229\\nCouncil will deny  the extension request if it finds “there is no good cause” for\\nrequesting  a subsequ ent EOT request and will “continue processing  the\\nrequest for review.”  Id.  It is not alway s necessary  for the AC to respond to\\nan EOT request before performing  a substantive review as “[certain\\ncircumstances may  render the request moot.”  Id.\\nHAL LEX I -3-1-14(A) provides the following  example: \\nif the AC has received the additional evidence or arguments mentioned in\\nthe EOT request when the analy st examines the claim(s) file, the EOT\\nrequest may be moot. In these  circumstances the AC may address an\\ninitial or subsequent EOT request with its action on the request for review.\\nThe analy st will add the following  language to the action document,\\nmodified as appropriate: “On [date of request], a request was made for an\\nextension of time to submit additional evidence(A) and/or argument.\\nThese materials have been received. \\nHAL LEX I-3-1-14(B ) addresses procedures for processing  initial EOT\\nrequests and states: \\nThe AC’s notice granting  the initial EOT responds to all EOT requests\\nreceived on the case through the date of the notice.” NOTE: Unless the EOT\\nrequest is moot, when granting  the initial EOT request, the AC will provide\\n25 days for submission of additional evidence or argument even when the\\nclaim has been pending  before the AC for an extended time and OAO staff\\ndoes not discover the EOT request until after 25 days from the date of the\\ninitial request. \\nHAL LEX I-3-1-14(B ) also addresses procedures for processing  subsequent\\nEOT requests and states that if the AC determines good cause exists, it will\\nsend notice grantin g the subsequent EOT request. “The AC will provide the\\nclaimant and appointed representative, if any, an additional 30 days to submit\\nadditional evidence or argument on any subsequent EOT it grants.” Id. “If the\\nAC finds there is no good cause to provide an additional EOT, the AC will\\nissue a notice deny ing the EOT” and will “continue processing  the request for\\nreview following  the denial of any  subsequent EOT.” Id.\\nL. SUBSEQUENT APPL ICAT IONS \\n1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new\\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\nAppli cable law:  In SSR 11-1p, SSA announced that a claimant can\\nordinarily  no longer have a new disability  claim processed where another\\nclaim of the same type is still pending  at any level of administrative review. \\nSSR 11-1p explains that under the SSA’s new procedure, a claimant must\\n230\\nusually  choose between continuing  to pursue administrative review of a claim\\nand filing  a new claim of the same title and type.  According  to the Ruling ,\\nthis procedure is warranted in order to decrease administrative costs in the\\nface of increased applications, and due to a risk of improper payments\\nresulting  from the processing  of subsequent claims.  SSR 11-1p does not\\naffect claimants wishing  to file a subsequent  application once the prior claim\\nis on appeal in federal court.\\nThe Ruling  explains that new applications will ordinarily  no longer be\\naccepted while a “prior disability  claim is pending  administrative review,” but\\nthat a claimant can still provide SSA “with evidence that is relevant to\\npending  claim, in accordance with [its] existing  regulations and procedures.” \\nWhere a claimant submits evidence to the Appeals Council that is relevant\\nonly to the period after the ALJ’s decision , the Appeals Council will return\\nthe evidence to the claimant. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.976(b), 416.1476(b). \\nHowever, SSR 11-1p provides that if the eviden ce “shows a new critical or\\ndisabling  condition, and” the claimant informs SSA that he or she desires “to\\nfile a new claim based on this evidence, the Appeals Council may permit” the\\nfiling  of “a new disability  claim before it completes its action on [the\\nclaimant’s]  request for review of the pending  claim.”\\n2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim.\\nApplicable law:  Accor ding to SSR 11-1p, improved electronic handling  of\\ninformation has enab led SSA to “act on additional evidence promptly .” \\nMoreover, the Ruling  indicates SSA “will act expeditiously ” wher e “the\\nadditional evidence indicates a critical or dire need situation[ .]” What\\nconstitutes such a situation  is not defined by SSR 11-1p, but the Ruling  also\\nstates that review of the pending  claim will be expedited “[i]f the new and\\nmaterial evidence that relates to the period on or before the date of the hearing\\ndecision shows a critical or disabling  condition[ .]”\\n3.Submiss ion of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\n \\nApplicable law:  SSR 11-1p provides that evidence the Appeals Council\\ndeems unrelated to the period on or before the ALJ’s decision will be returned\\nto the claimant along  with a notice that “will explain why the Appeals Council\\ndid not accept the evidence and inform you that, under certain circumstances,\\nwe will consider the date you filed the request for Appeals Council review as\\nthe filing  date for y our new claim.”  The Ruling  goes on to ex plain that:\\nIf you originally  filed for disability  benefits under title II, and you file a\\nnew application for title II disabili ty benefits within six months of the date\\nof this notice, we will use the date of your request for Appeals Council\\n231\\nreview as the filing  date.  If both applications are for Supplemental\\nSecurity  Income payments based on disability  under title XVI, and you\\nfile the new application within 60 days from the date of the notice,  we will\\nuse the date you requested Appeals Council review as the filing date for\\nthe new claim.  We will permit the filing  of a new disability  claim after\\nthe Appeals Council completes its action on the request for review of the\\npending  claim.\\nM.RIGHT TO A HEARING  BEFORE A NE W ALJ\\n1.In accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\nApplicable law:  While the Hearing  Office Chief “generall y assigns cases to\\nALJs on a rotational basis, with the earliest (i.e., oldest) [request for hearing s]\\nreceiving priority , cases are assig ned in a different order where there is a\\n“special situation” requiring  a “change in the order in which a case is\\nassig ned.” HAL LEX I-2-1-55(A).68 Some of these “special situations”  involve\\n68 HAL LEX I -2-1-55(E) lists exceptions to case rotation in the following circumstances:\\n1. Assignment of New Claim Whe n Claimant Voluntarily Withdraws [request for hearing “(RH”)]\\nIf a claimant voluntarily asks to withdraw his or her RH a fter an AL J has been assigned to the case,\\nand the ALJ grants the claimant’s request (see HALLEX I-2-4-20), except in the circumstances noted\\nin subsection F, the same ALJ will generally be assigned if the claimant later submits a RH on a new\\napplication.\\nNOTE:\\nIf the previous ALJ has transferred to another office or is otherwise unavailable (see HAL LEX I-2-8-\\n40), the case may be assigned to a different ALJ. However, a change in the claimant’s address will\\nnot necessarily necessitate a change in the assigned AL J. Se e HAL LEX I -2-0-70 and I -2-3-10.\\nCheck the Case Processing and Management System (CPMS)  entry for the case to confirm that the\\nprior dismissal was based on the claimant’s voluntary withdrawal of his or her RH.  The status field\\nshould display the “WDDI ” withdrawal dismissal code.  Check the decision maker field for the name\\nof the ALJ who issued that dismissal.\\n Assignment of Case Whe n Claimant Withdraws Appl ication\\nIf an ALJ has been assigned to a case and the claimant withdraws his or her application, the same\\nALJ will be assigned if the claimant submits a RH o n a new application. \\nNOTE:   \\nSee HAL LEX 1-2-4-22 Claimant Reque sts Withdrawal of Appli cation (6/24/21) for guidance on\\napplication withdrawal. If an ALJ has already issued a decision or order of dismissal, an ALJ will\\nnot accept a request to withdraw the application. However, a claimant may submit a written request\\nto cancel the request to withdraw the application within 60 days of the date the request was approved.\\n232\\nassig ning a  case to a new AL J. See HAL LEX I -2-1-55(D). These include:\\n•In time-limited court remand cases, where a “court has ordered the\\nCommissioner to complete one or more specific actions within a set\\ntime period,” the cases must be assigned immediately .  These cases\\n“are generally  assigned to the same ALJ who issued the decision or\\ndismissal,  unless the AC or court specifically  directs otherwise, or the\\nALJ is no long er with the ag ency .”\\n•A delay ed court remand case which is defined as a “case is over 125\\ndays old (counting  from the date of the court’s order) or a court\\nremand that the AC remanded to an ALJ a second time.” These cases\\nmust be assigned immediately . “If the AC remanded a second time,\\nassig n to a different AL J.”\\n•Other court remand cases must also be assig ned immediately .  “If the\\nAC remanded a second time, assig n to a different AL J.”\\n•Non-court AC remands must also be assig ned immediately  and are\\n“assigned to the same ALJ who issued the decision or dismissal\\nunless:\\n•the case was previously  assig ned to that ALJ on a prior remand\\nfrom the AC and the ALJ’s decision or dismissal after remand is\\nthe subject of the new AC remand; or\\n•the AC directs the case be assig ned to a different AL J \\n    \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-55(D)(Note) further provides:\\nAC remands for decisions or dismissals issued by National Hearin g Center\\n(NHC) ALJs are sent to the HO servicing  the claimant’s current address.\\nIf the NHC is still providing  assistance to the HO and the NHC ALJ is\\ncurrently  on duty in the same NHC, the case may be assig ned to the NHC\\nALJ unless the claimant has filed a timely  objection to appearing at the\\nhearing  by VTC.  See HAL LEX I -2-0-21.\\nHALLEX I-2-1-55(F )(1) provides that in those cases where a hearing  has yet\\nto be held, a HOCAL J “may reassig n a case to a different ALJ” in the\\nfollowing  circumstances:\\n•When it is necessary to ensure that the claimant will have his or her\\ncase heard or decided in a timely  manner;\\n•The ALJ who was assig ned the case initially  is not available to\\nconduct the hearing  because of death, retirement, resig nation, illness,\\nSee 20 CFR 404.641 a nd 416.360. \\n233\\nor other cause resulting  in prolong ed absence of 20 or more day s; or\\n•The ALJ who was assigned the case is unavailable on short notice to\\nconduct the hearing .\\nHALLEX I-2-1-55(F )(2) provides that in those cases after a hearing  has been\\nheld, the case may be reassig ned if the ALJ has not approved a draft decision\\nand must consider “whether the delay  in issuing  a decision constitutes a\\ndetriment to the public.”  If the case is reassig ned, “the ALJ to whom the case\\nis reassig ned will review all the evidence of record, including  the audio\\nrecording  of the hearing ”.  If a fully favorable decision will be issued, the ALJ\\nneed not conduct another hearing .  The ALJ “may find another hearing  is\\nnecessary  if, for example, relevant expert evidence was needed but was not\\nobtained at the hearing , or the ALJ needs additional testimo ny to fully\\nevaluate a claimant’s alleg ations of pain and other sy mptoms.”  Id.\\nFinally , the “HOCAL J or other manag ement ALJ may also determine that a\\nreassig nment and case transfer are appropriate if the claimant chang es\\nresidence while the request  for hearing  is pending . See HAL LEX I-2-3-11.” \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-55(F )(2)(NOTE).\\n2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeal s Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. 404.940 and 416.1440.  \\nApplicable law:  HALLEX I-3-7-14(H) addresses “Unfair Hearing\\nAlleg ations” and provides that when the record supports a claimant’s\\nalleg ation “that the hearing  was unfair and the record demonstrates that the\\nALJ abused his or her discretion, the AC will grant review,  and, when remand\\nis appropriate, remand  the case to a different ALJ.  See HAL LEX I-3-2-25\\nand I -3-3-2.”\\nN. DUTY TO FOLLOW APPE ALS CO UNCIL  REMAND O RDERS\\n1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that on remand from the Appeals\\nCouncil, “[t]he administrative law judge shall take any action that is ordered\\nby the Appeals Council and may take any additional action that is not\\ninconsistent with the Appeals Council’s remand order.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.977(b), 416.1577(b) (emphasis added).\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-85(A) provides that an ALJ “may seek clarification of an\\nAppeals Council (AC) remand order” only  when:\\n234\\n•The ALJ cannot carry out the directive(s) set forth in the remand\\norder;69 or \\n•The directive(s) in the remand order appears to have been rendered\\nmoot.70\\n69 HAL LEX I-2-1-85(C) (1) provides that an ALJ may not be able to carry out a directive in the following\\nsituations:\\n  \\n•The directive(s) violates law or agency policy, or carrying out the directive(s) may require the\\nALJ to violate law or agency policy;\\n•The directive(s), if followed, would cause inordinate delay in a claim or be unne cessarily\\nburde nsome; or\\n•The directive(s) is based on a factual or clerical error, and the error results in a directive(s) that\\ncannot be carried out or a directive(s) that is uncl ear based on the actual facts.\\nThe following are examples of valid clarification requests:\\n•The AC directs the ALJ to request a consultative examination to evaluate the claimant’s mental\\nimpairments. The claimant is in a confinement facility for an extended period of time, and the\\nfacility will not allow a consultative examination while the claimant is confined.\\n•The AC directs the ALJ to obtain a hearing test and examination performed by a qualified\\notolaryngologist but there is no otolaryngologist in the area servicing the HO.\\n•The AC reman d directs the ALJ to consider the findings of a prior ALJ decision, but the AC\\nmade an error and no  prior ALJ decision was issued.  \\nThis HAL LEX further states that an ALJ may “only request clarification based on a clerical or factual\\nerror in the AC remand order if the error is substantive and directly related to a specific directive”\\nand “[d]isagreement with an aspect of the remand order does not constitute a factual error.”  Id.  The\\nHALLEX goes on to list specific examples of clarification requests that are valid, including a\\ndisagreement about the AC’s finding of good cause for a claimant not appearing at a hearing, or the\\nremand order failing to cite a regulatory basis for granting review, or the AC not explaining the basis\\nfor needing a medical expert, or the directive was issued by a federal court, or the ALJ previously\\nreceived conflicting instructions on another case.  \\n70 HAL LEX I -2-1-85(C)(2) provides examples of when a directive appears to be rendered moot: \\n  A change in circumstance or an error of fact may make a directive(s) obsolete in some instances.  The\\nfollowing are examples of valid requests for clarification in these circumstances:\\n•The AC remands a case for a new hearing solely because the hearing recording cannot be\\nlocated. The hearing recording is subsequently found and is determined to be audible, and a new\\nhearing has not yet been hel d.\\n•The AC remands a case to determine the identity and Social Security num ber (SSN)  of the wage\\nearner on whose record the claimant may apply for benefits.  On remand, the HO discovers a\\nclerical error resulted in the entering of an incorrect digit in the SSN in the Case Processing and\\n235\\nALJs may not seek clarification of AC remand orders under any other\\ncircumstances.71\\nIf the “AC accepts a clarification request, it will vacate its remand order and\\nissue a new action.”  HALLEX I-2-1-85(A).  Since the AC will not vacate a\\nremand order after an ALJ holds a new hearing, “if an ALJ intends to request\\nclarification from the AC, he or she must submit the request before\\nconducting  a hearing  (and whenever possible, before scheduling  a hearing ).” \\nId.\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-85(A)(Note) also provides that while the criteria for clarification\\nmay not be present, feedback to the AC may  be appropriate:\\nIf the AC remand order itself is unclear, may demonstrate inconsistent\\napplication of policy  by the AC, or, while technically  correct, contains\\ninsig nificant errors that would not likely  result in a Federal court remand, the\\nALJ can refer the case throug h the AC feedback initiative, as explained in\\nHAL LEX I -2-1-88.\\nO.ALJ BIAS, PRE JUDICE , OR FAIL URE TO FOLLOW\\nPROCEDURE S\\n1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council shou ld issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-1p describes the process es for handling  alleg ations\\nof ALJ unfairness, prejudice, partiality , bias, misconduct, or discrimination. It\\nprovides, in part, that a party  may ask for review by the Appeals Council\\nwhere an ALJ refuses to withdraw despite the party’s objection. Id. Based on\\ninformation in the administrative record, the Appeals Counci l will apply  the\\nabuse of discretion standard and may provide a new decision on the claim or\\nremand for further proceeding s. Id.\\nManagement System (CPMS)  and the HO c orrected the error.\\n71See also HAL LEX I-2-1-86 (Formal Requests for Clarification - Procedures) which sets forth the specific\\nprocedures for communicating with the Appe als Council and emphasizes that the ALJ or designated hearing\\noffice staff, “who wants to request formal clarification of an AC remand order must communicate with the\\nAC only as set forth” in HAL LEX I-2-1-86.  This HAL LEX provides that HO staff and ALJs may not directly\\ncontact AC adjudicators regarding specific cases, regardless of whether the case is pending at the AC or at\\nthe HO.  Under HAL LEX I-2-1-86 there are two required steps to obtain formal clarification from the AC:\\n• First, an AL J must obtain appro val from HO m anagement to request clarification; and\\n• Second, if HO management appro ves, the ALJ must submit the request to the AC and obtain\\na response from the AC be fore acting on the hearing level case. \\n236\\nThe Ruling  provides  that after being  presented with objections, the Appeals\\nCouncil will review the allega tions and ALJ decision under the abuse of\\ndiscretion standard. An abuse of discretion takes place where: (1) the ALJ’s\\naction is erroneous  and without rational basis; (2) the ALJ’s action is clearly\\nnot justified under the circumstances; (3) certain failures to follow required\\nprocedures has occurred; or (4) the evidence of record shows the ALJ was\\nprejudiced or partial, or had an interest in the pending  matter. Id.\\nHAL LEX I-3-7- 14(H) addresses “Unfair Hearing  Alleg ations” and discusses\\nhow the Appeal s Council addresses these alleg ations and the circumstances\\nwhen the Appeals Council will direct the assig nment of the case to a new\\nALJ. HAL LEX I -3-7-14 (H) states:\\nWhen a claimant alleg es the hearing  was unfair and the record\\ndemonstr ates that the ALJ abused his or her discretion, the AC will grant\\nreview, and, when remand is appropriate, remand the case to a different\\nALJ. See HAL LEX I -3-2-25 and I -3-3-2.\\n2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidenced  by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-1p describes three distinct processes  for evaluating\\nunfair hearing s: \\nAll adjudicators, including  our ALJs, must fulfill  their duties with fairness\\nand impartiality . We have three separate processes to guard against\\nunfairness in our hearing  process: (1) the Appeals Council review process,\\nunder which we review hearing  decisions in accordance with 20 C.F.R.\\n404.969, 404.970, 416.1469 and 416.1470, to ensure that ALJs fairly  and\\nimpartial ly consider claims for benefits; (2) the Division of Quality\\nService’s ALJ complaint investig ation process; and (3) the civil rights\\ninvestig ation process for alleg ations of discrimination involving\\nunfairness, prejudice, partiality , or bias based on race, color, national\\norigin (including  English language ability ), religion, sex, sexual\\norientation, age, disability, or in retaliation for having  previously  filed a\\ncivil rights complaint. These three processes operate separately  from one\\nanother and have different focuses.\\nHAL LEX I-3-2-25 states that bias includes egregious conduct, which is\\ndefined as conduct that shows unfairness, prejudice, partiality , bias,\\nmisconduct, discrimination, or equivalent.\\n3.The languag e of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decisio n as a forum for criticiz ing [the agency ,\\nagency  policy or procedure, other government agencies, the courts, the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] .\\n237\\n4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.  \\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-25 discusses the language and style of\\ndecisions and provides that:\\nWhen writing  or reviewing  a draft decision, an AL J will not use:\\n•Emotionally  charg ed words, disapproving  or derog atory  terms, or\\npersonal judg ments or opinions;\\n•Medical tex ts or publications as the authority  for resolving  an issue;\\n•Non-prescribed standardiz ed lang uage in the rationale; or\\n•The decision as a forum for criticizing the agency , agency  policy  or\\nprocedure, other government agencies, the courts, the representative,\\nor the claimant.\\nP. REDETERMINATIONS DUE  TO FRAUD O R SIM ILAR\\nFAUL T\\n1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding  of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n  2.The ALJ’s finding that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar faul t\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\n  3.The ALJ failed to apply the applicable standard for excluding  evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable ground s to suspect, that\\nthe person knew  the evidence provided was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n 4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there  was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.   \\n 5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason]  into\\naccount in excluding  evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided. \\n6.The ALJ failed to comply  with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermin ation of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p. \\n238\\n7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n8.The notice of determi nation or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficie nt because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencies prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision. \\nApplicable law :  42 U.S.C. 405(u)(1) g overning  redetermination provides:\\n(A)  The Commi ssioner of Social Security  shall immediately  redetermine\\nthe entitlement of individuals to monthly  insurance benefits under this\\nsubchapter if there is reason to believe that fraud or simil ar fault was\\ninvolved in the application of the individual for such benefits, unless a\\nUnited States attorney, or equivalent State prosecutor, with jurisdiction\\nover potential or actual related criminal cases, certifies, in writing , that\\nthere is a substantial risk that such action by the Commissioner of Social\\nSecurity  with regard to beneficiaries in a particular investig ation woul d\\njeopardiz e the criminal prosecution of a person involved in a suspected\\nfraud.\\n(B)When redetermining  the entitlement, or making  an initial\\ndetermination of entitlement, of an individual under this subch apter, the\\nCommissioner of Social Securit y shall disreg ard any evidence if there is\\nreason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing\\nof such evidence.\\n42 U.S.C. 405(u)(1). \\nFormer SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p were rescinded and replaced with SSR 22-\\n1p and SSR 22-2p, effective May 17, 2022. SSR 22-1p (Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations) and SSR 22-2p (Evaluation of Claims Involving  the\\nIssue of Similar Fault in the Prov iding of Evidence).72   explain that the\\n72Following the issuance of SSR 22-1p and 22-2p, SSA issued numerous HAL LEX providing guidance\\nregarding these new rulings.  The following HAL LEX issued on June 7, 2022, are related to SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22- 2p: \\n•I-1-3-15 (Adjudicating Fraud or Similar Fault Issues) \\n•I-1-3-25 (Processi ng Cases Unde r Sections 205(U) and 1631( E) (7) of the Social Security Act\\n(Fraud or Similar Fault “Redeterminations”) \\n•I-1-3-26 (Processing Non-Redetermination Fraud or Similar Fault Cases and Disregarding\\nEvidence Unde r Sections 205( U)(1)(B) and 1631( E)(7)(A)(II) of The Social Security Act)\\n•I-2-10-1 (Overview) \\n•I-2-10-6 (Notice of Hearing ) \\n•I-2-1010 ( Considering Evidence Whe n Fra ud or Similar Fault Is Involved) \\n239\\nevidentiary  standard for fraud and similar fault is revised from  a\\n“preponderance of the evidence” to “reason to believe” to align more closely\\nwith the standard provided in the Social Security  Act.  Additionally , the\\nRuling s set forth a new procedure which provides that, before SSA will\\ndisreg ard evidence under the Act at the hearing s level of the administra tive\\nreview  process, SSA will consider the individual’s objection to the\\ndisreg arding  of that evidence. \\n  SSA expects that these revised procedures will allow implementation of\\nrelevant sections of the Act in a manner consistent with the decisions of the\\nCourts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the procedures\\noutlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. \\nProcess for redeterm ining the entitlem ent to benef its.  SSR 22-1p sets\\nforth the process for redetermining  for redetermining  an individua l’s\\nentitlement to monthly  insurance benefits under Title II or eligibility  for\\npayments under Title XVI of the Act and provides “we will immediately\\nredetermine an individual’s entitlement to benefi ts or eligibility  for payments\\nwhen there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in an\\nindividual’s application for benefits or payments, including  the provid ing of\\nevidence.” SSR 22-2p sets forth the process for evaluating  and adjudi cating\\nclaims in which “there is reason to believe similar fault was involved  in the\\nproviding  of evidence to us in support of a claim for benefits under title II or\\npayments under title XVI of the Social Security  Act (Act).” Whenever such\\nreason exists, the Social Security  Independence and Program Improvements\\nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(u), 1383(e)(7), provides for an immediate\\nredetermination. \\nDuring  the redetermination, SSR 22-1p provides the SSA disreg ards evidence,\\nfrom any individual or entity , as to which “there is reason to believe that fraud\\nor similar fault was involved in providing  that evidence.” This includes: \\nevidence supplied, prepared, or signed by a medical source or nonmedical\\nsource when there is a reason to believe that the source knowing ly (1)\\nprovided incorrect or incomplete evidence material to the determination or\\ndecision or (2) concealed or failed to disclose evidence material to the\\n•I-2-10-14 (Writing A Decision When Fraud or Similar Fault Is At Issue) I-2-10-16\\n(Adm inistrative Sanction Cases) \\n•1-3-10-1 (Overview) \\n•I-3-10-5 (Appe als Council Final Actions Whe n a Fraud or Similar Fault Issue Is Raised)\\n \\nThe following HAL LEX issued on June  28, 2022, a re also related to SSR 22- 1p and SSR 22-2p:  \\n•I-1-3-30 (Referring Non-compliant Excluded Medical Sources of Evidence to the Office of the\\nInspector General)\\n•I-2-5-15 (Excluded Me dical Sources of Evidence) \\n•I-3-2-36 (Excluded Me dical Sources of Evidence) \\n240\\ndetermination or decision, even if it includes a report prepared or signed\\nby another source. \\nUnder SSR 22-2p, SSA disreg ards evidence due to similar fault “if there is\\nreason to believe, meaning reasonable grounds to suspect, that the person\\nknew the evidence provided was false or incomplete or that the information\\nthat was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.” \\nSSR 22-2p makes a significant chang e to the effect that a finding  of similar\\nfault will have on other claims by eliminating  the language in former SSR 16-\\n2p that: \\na finding  of similar fault concerning  a material fact may constitute\\nevidence to be considered in determining  whether there is reason to\\nbelieve that similar fault was involved with respect to other evidence\\nprovided by the same source, and may justify  disreg arding  other evidence\\nfrom that source. Also, the evidence relied on to make a finding of similar\\nfault in one claim may be considered in deciding  whether there is similar\\nfault in another claim or in deciding  whether to give less weig ht to\\nevidence in another claim. \\n  SSR 22-1p also provides that after determining what evidence is to be\\ndisreg arded, the adjudicator then considers eligibility  for benefits in light of\\nthe remaining  evidence, including  evidence not presented previously  and\\nevidence post-dating  the original allowance so long  as it relate s to the period\\nat issue. This includes evidence included in the record at the time of the\\noriginal favorable determination or decision, along  with evidence provided\\nduring  the redetermination process. When requested, SSA will help\\nindividuals obtain evidence relevant to the redetermination. If the remaining\\nevidence  does not support benefit entitlement or eligibility  at the time of the\\noriginal allowance, the agency “may  terminate such entitlement or eligibility\\nand may treat benefits paid or payments made based on such evidence as\\noverpay ments.” \\nDefinitions of fraud , similar fault, material, know ingly, and “reason to\\nbelieve”  \\n•Fraud. Fraud exists when a person, with the intent to defraud, either\\nmakes or causes to be made, a false statement or misrepresentation of\\na material fact for use in determining  rights under the Act; or conceals\\nor fails to disclose a material fact for use in determining  rights under\\nthe Act. \\n•Similar Fault . Similar fault is involved with respect to a determination\\nif: “an incorrect or incomplete statement that is material to the\\ndetermination is knowing ly made or information that is material to the\\ndetermination is knowing ly concealed.”\\n241\\n•Material. Material describes a statement or informatio n, or an\\nomission from a statement or information that could influence us in\\ndetermining  entitleme nt to benefits under title II or eligibility  for\\nbenefits under title XVI  of the Act. \\n•Knowingly . Knowing ly describes a person’s awareness or\\nunderstanding  regarding  the correctness or completeness of the\\ninformation he or she provides us, or the materiality  of the information\\nhe or she conceals from us. \\n•Reason to Believe. Reason to believe means reasonable grounds to\\nsuspect that fraud or similar fault was involved in the application or\\nthe provision of evidence. The reason to believe standard requires\\nmore than mere suspicion, speculation, or a hunch, but it does not\\nrequire a preponderance of evidence. \\nException to immediate redeterm ination . SSR 22-1p notes that the Social\\nSecurity  Independence and Prog ram Impro vements Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §§\\n405(u), 1383(e)(7), provides for an immediate redeterm ination with one\\nexception: when a prosecutor “with jurisdiction over potential or actual\\nrelated criminal cases, certifies, in writing , that there is a substantial risk that\\n[the agency’s] action with regard to beneficiaries or recip ients in a particular\\ninvestig ation would jeopardiz e the criminal prosecution of a person involved\\nin a suspected fraud.” Id. \\nIndividual receiving benef its need not be the one who committed the\\nfraud or similar fault.   Individual receiving  al SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p\\nexplain that for SSA to disre gard evidence it is not necessary  that the affected\\nbenefici ary or recipient had knowledg e of or participated in the fraud or\\nsimilar fault and that SSA will document the record with the description of the\\ndisreg arded evidence and the reasons for disreg arding  the evidence.  SSR 22-\\n1p and SSR 22-2p also explain that in certain circumstances, SSA may\\ndisregard evidence provided by someone who has not committed fraud or\\nsimilar fault, but whose evidence relies on other evidence invol ving fraud or\\nsimilar fault. For example, SSA may disre gard parts of a medical source’s\\nopinion, which relies on evidence that SSA disreg arded from another medical\\nsource. Depending  on the extent to which the medical source relied on the\\ndisregarded evidence, SSA may disreg ard some or all of the medical source’ s\\nopinion. \\n Scope of evidence to be considered on redetermination.  When\\nredetermining  a claim, additional evidence is to be considered so long as it is\\nrelevant. SSR 22-1p provides that after determining  what evidence is to be\\ndisreg arded, the adjudicator then considers eligibility  for benefits in light of\\nthe remaining  evidence, including  evidence not presented previously  and\\nevidence post-dating  the original allowance so long as it relates to the period\\nat issue. \\n242\\nSSR 22-1p and SSR-22-2p provide that generally , a finding  that there is\\nreason to believe fraud or similar fault was involved in providing evidence\\ndoes not constitute complete adjudicative action in any claim. Even if SSA\\ndisreg ards evidence, SSA will evaluate the remaining  evidence of record and\\ndetermine whether that evidence supports  a finding of entitlement to benefits\\nor eligibility  for payments.  SSR 22-1p is phrased permissively  with regard to\\ncircumstances where the remaining  evidence does not support benefit\\nentitlement or eligibility  at the time of the original allowance.  In such cases,\\nthe agency  “may  terminate such entitlement or eligibility and may treat\\nbenefits paid or pay ments made based on such evidence as overpay ments.”\\nProcedural requirem ents in f raud and sim ilar f ault cases \\nSSR 22-1p and 22-2p acknowledg e that an adjudicator must adhere to due\\nprocess and confiden tiality requirements and must consider all record\\nevid ence before determining  whether specific evidence may be disreg arded. \\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p revise the evidenti ary standard for fraud and\\nsimilar fault from a “preponderance of the evidence” to “reason to believe” to\\nalign more closely  with the standard provided in the Act. “Reason to believe”\\nmeans reaso nable grounds to suspect that fraud or similar fault was involved\\nin the appl ication or in the provision of evidence. The “reason to believe\\nstandard” requires more than mere suspicion, speculation, or a hunch, but it\\ndoes not require a preponderance of evidence. \\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p provide that before evidence  can be disreg arded,\\nthe individual’s objection to the disreg arding  of that evidence will be\\nconsidered. After considering  any objections, adjudicators will decide whether\\nthere is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing\\nevidence in the individual’s case. \\nDocum entary and analytical responsibilities of  adjudicators \\n Under SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p, adjudicators will consider all evidence i n\\nthe case   record before determining  whether specific evidence must be\\ndisreg arded. SSR 22-2p   provides: \\nIn determining  if there is reason to believe fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved, adjud icators may make reasonable inferences based on the\\ntotality  of the circumstances such as facts or case characteristics common\\nto patterns of known or suspected fraudulent activity . . . . Adjudicators\\nwill fully  document the record with the description of the disreg arded\\nevidence and the reasons for disreg arding  the evidence. \\n  SSR  22-2p provides that in determinations or decisions that involve a finding\\nof similar fault and disreg arding  evidence, the notice of determin ation or\\ndecision must:\\n \\n 1) Explain the applicable provisio n of the Act that allows the adjudicator to\\ndisreg ard particular evidence due to a similar fault finding . \\n243\\n2)  Identify  the documents or other evidence that is being  disreg arded. \\n3)  Provide a discussion of the evidence that supports a finding  to disregard\\nevidence. The discussion must explain that, in accordance with the law,\\nthe evidence identified cannot be used as evidence in a claim because,\\nafter considering  all the information in the case record, the adjudicator has\\nreason to believe that similar fault was involved in providing  the evide nce.\\nA similar fault finding  can be made only if there is reason to believe the\\nperson knew that the evidence provided was false  or incomplete. A similar\\nfault finding  cannot be based on speculation or suspicion. \\n4) Provide a determination or decision based on an evaluation of the\\nremaining  evidence in accordance with other rules and procedures. A\\nsimilar fault finding  does not constitu te complete adjudicative action in\\nany claim. A person may still be found entitled to benefits or eligible for\\npayments desp ite that some evidence in the case record has been\\ndisreg arded based on similar fault. For example, a person may be found to\\nbe under a disability  based on impairments that are estab lished by\\nevidence that is not disreg arded because of similar fault. \\n5) Include standard appeal lang uage. \\n \\nAppeal rights in redeterm ination cases \\n SSR 22-1p and 22-2p e xplain that an individual may appeal a finding  of fraud\\nor similar fault, and together with the appeal object to a findi ng to disreg ard\\nevidence, may appeal a deter mination that the remaining  evidence does not\\nsupport entitlement or eligibility , and may appeal any overpay ments assessed\\nin accordance with SSA’s rules for administrative review.  SSR 22-1p\\nprovides that an individual may, in accordance with the usual rules governing\\noverpay ments, also request waiver of an overpay ment from the ag ency. \\nSuccessf ul challenges to f ormer SSR 16-1p and 16-2p \\nAs noted in SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p, the rescission and revision of SSR 16-\\n1p and  SSR 16- 2p were made by SSA due to Court challeng es. A decision\\nfrom the Sixth   Circuit found the redetermination process in violation of the\\nDue Process Clause and the Administrative Procedu res Act. See Hicks v.\\nComm’r of Soc. Sec., 909 F.3d 786 (6th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc den. (Mar.\\n29, 2019). Acquiescence Ruling  19-1(6), discussed below, was issued in\\nresponse to Hicks , and to date AR 19-1(6) has not been rescinded. The\\nSeventh Circuit also has found the redeterm ination proceeding s flawed\\nbecause the SSA did not provide the claimant an opportunity  to rebut\\nevidence of fraud before excluding  a physician’s report. See Jason v. Saul,\\n970 F.3d 775 (7th Cir. 2020). The Fourth Circuit also has also held the\\nredetermination process in violation of the Due Process Clause and\\nAdministrative Procedures Act in Kirk v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin ., 987\\nF.3d 314 (4th Cir. 2021). SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p now contain provisions\\nthat address these Court challeng es. \\n244\\n  District courts in several jurisdictions also faced challenges to the\\nredetermination   proceeding s under former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p, that\\nare now addressed by SSR 22-1p and 22-2p. See, e.g., Jeannie S. v. Saul, No.\\n1:16-CV-04681-L AW (N.D. Ga. Mar. 3, 2020) (unpub.); Tyler J. v. Saul, No.\\n17-cv-50090, 2019 WL 3716817, at *4-*8 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 7, 2019); Kirk v.\\nBerryhill , 388 F. Supp. 3d 652, 662-65 (D.S.C. 2019); Agosto v. Comm’r of\\nSoc. Sec., No. 18-cv-1271, 2019 WL 6190612,  at *5-*6 (D.P.R. Nov. 20,\\n2019); Picon- Gonzalez v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Adm in., No. 18- cv-1016,\\n2019  WL 4187701, at *10-16 (D.P.R. Sept. 4, 2019); Correa v. Saul, No. 18-\\n24536-CI V, 2020 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 8625, at *34 (S.D. F la. Jan. 15, 2020). \\n Acquiescence Ruling 19-1(6) \\nAR 19-1(6) acquiesces in the Sixth Circuit decision issued in Hicks v.\\nComm’r of Soc. Sec., 909 F.3d 786 (6th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc den. (Mar.\\n29, 2019) for claims within the Sixth Circuit (states of Kentucky , Michig an,\\nOhio, or Tennessee), and provides that for such claims, SSA will offer an\\nopportunity  to rebut alleg ations of fraud involvement. See also HAL LEX I-5-\\n4- 74 (“Implementation of The Hicks Acquiescenc e Ruling  (Sixth Circuit)”).73\\nThis is consistent with the revisions made to former SSR 16-1p and 16- 2p by\\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.  \\nContrary  to SSA policy , the court in Hicks held that before disreg arding\\nevidence during  a redetermination, the Commissio ner must supply  a factual\\nbasis for believing  fraud was involved in providing  evidence . Hicks,  909 F.3d\\nat 799. Moreover, plaintiffs must have a chance to rebut the Commissioner’s\\nassertions before a neutral decisionmaker. Id. AR 19-1(6) applies only to\\ncases in which evidence is disreg arded based on a referral from Office  of\\nInspector General (OIG) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-8(1) ; however, similar\\nprovisions in SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p do not require such referral. \\nIn cases where the affected individual resides in Kentucky , Michig an, Ohio,\\nor Tennessee at the time SSA makes its hearing -level decisi on, it must now\\nsupply  notice of the factual basis for belie ving that fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved in providing  evidence. See Hicks , 909 F.3d at 799. In Hicks,  the\\nSixth Circuit explained that the Supreme Court has long “reco gnized the\\n‘immutable’ principle that ‘where governmental action seriously  injures an\\nindividual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact finding s, the\\nevidence used to prove the Government’s case must be disclosed to the\\nindividual[ .]’” Id. at 797 (quoting  Greene v. McElroy , 360 U.S. 474, 496\\n(1959)). SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p now apply  this notice and disclosure\\nprinciple in all jurisdictions. \\nIn the Sixth Circuit, individuals must be given a chance to rebut assertions of\\nfraud or  similar fault. While a claimant need not have played a role in the\\n73[Editor’s note: The provision in AR 19- 1(6) that for claimants outside of the Sixth Circuit the agency will\\ncontinue to ignore objections to SSA disregarding the evidence appears to be overruled by SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22- 2p].\\n245\\nfraud or similar  fault, he or she must have “an opportunity  to show that it is\\nuntrue.’” Hicks,  909 F.3d at 797 (quoting  Greene,  360 U.S. at 496). The\\nRuling  thus specifies that SSA must provide the claimant with an oppor tunity\\nto challeng e the agency ’s reason to believe that fraud or simila r fault was\\ninvolved in the provision of evidence. Moreover, the opportunity  for rebuttal\\nmust be held before a neutral decis ionmaker. Citing  the plurality  opinion in\\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507, 533 (2004), the Hicks  court determined that\\nan individual’s opportunity  to rebut the Government’s factual assertions must\\noccur before a neutral decisionmaker. Hicks, 909 F.3d at 797. SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22-2p now apply  this opportunity  to object before an adjudicator and on\\nappeal to all jurisdictions.\\nTem porary Instructions f or Im plem entation of  AR 19-1(6)\\n HALLEX I-5-4-74, was issued March 13, 2020, as a Temporary  Instruction\\nproviding  guidance for implementing  AR 19-1(6). I t provides, in summary : \\n  •Upon receipt of a sentence four Hicks court remand, the AC will issue\\na remand order instructing  an ALJ to conduct a hearing  and issue a\\nnew decision on the issue of disability  during  the period on or before\\nthe date of the orig inal allowance. \\n  \\n  •The ALJ will determine whether there is reason to believe fraud or\\nsimilar fault was involved in the providing  of evidence in support of\\nthe beneficiary  or recipient’s application for disability  benefits. \\n  \\n•The ALJ will consider all evidence that is new, material, and related to\\nthe period at issue including  evidence the beneficiary  or recipient\\nobtained from the Receivers previously  associated with his or her file\\nin the office of his or her former representative.\\n•ALJs must issue decisions in cases rema nded for further\\nadministrative actions under AR 19-1(6). \\nUnder no circumstances can ALJs dismiss the requests for hearing  in these\\ncases. If the beneficiary  or recipient fails to appear and does not establish\\ngood cause or waives or constructively  waives the right to appear at the\\nhearing , the ALJ will issue a decision on the record. The ALJ may choose to\\nproceed with the hearing  if witness testimony  is necessary  to resolve the case.\\nIf an appointe d representative appears without the beneficiary  or recipient, the\\nALJ will allow the appointed representative to question witnesses and make\\narguments on the beneficiary  or recipient’s behalf. \\n  Upon receipt of the AC remand order, SRC staff will send the beneficiary or\\nrecipient an acknowledg ment letter and proffer the OIG Affidavit as well as\\nany other evidence related to the issue of whether fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved in the providing  of evidence. The OIG Affidavit will contain the\\nfactual basis for the OIG’s investig ation and the reason to believe that fraud\\n246\\nwas involved in the application or in the providing  of evidence. \\n•  The acknowledgment letter will provide the benefic iary or recipient\\nand representative the opportunity to submit written objections to the\\nproffered evidence at least 5 business days before the scheduled\\nhearing ; provide the beneficiary  or recipient and representativ e the\\nopportunity  to submit a written request to the ALJ, no later than 30\\ndays after receipt of the acknowledg ment letter, explaining  why it is\\nnecessary  that an OIG witness appear at the hearing ; and request the\\nbeneficiary  or recipient and representative submit evidence that is\\nnew, material, and related to the period on or before the date of the\\noriginal allowance. This evidence may include evidence the\\nbenefic iary or recipient obtained from the Receivers previously\\nassociated with his or her file in Eric C. Conn’s office.\\n   •To provid e notice of the hearing, the ALJ will send the beneficiary  or\\nrecipient the notice in Attachment 2 to the AR. If the ALJ determines\\ntestimony  from an OIG witness is necessary , the Notice of Hearing\\nwill inform the beneficiary  or recipient and representativ e of the\\nidentity  of any OIG witness who OIG intends to have appear at the\\nhearing . The Notice of Hearing will also inform the beneficiary  or\\nrecipient of the right to request that the ALJ issue a subpoena for any\\nother witnesses or documents pursuant to HAL LEX I-2-5-78 . Prior to\\nthe hearing , the SRC will also send the beneficiary  or recipient and\\nrepresentative, if any, an Exhibit Letter (Attachment 3) proposi ng the\\nexhibits at issue for the hearing . \\n07/31/2024\\n247\\nPART II - SSA  CHARTS,\\nMEMOR ANDA & MOR E!\\n1.

Did the ALJ adequately consider the claimant's cognitive impairments, including difficulties with comprehension, concentration, and word-finding, in accordance with SSR 14-1p when evaluating the impact of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) on the claimant's ability to work?\\n\\n2. Did the ALJ fail to assess the cumulative effects of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and other impairments on their residual functional capacity (RFC) as required by SSR 14-1p, and how did this oversight affect the determination of the claimant's ability to perform substantial gainful activity?\\n\\n3. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n4. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the claimant's treatment history and the effectiveness of prescribed therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n5. Did the ALJ violate HALLEX I-2-5-44 by failing to obtain a medical expert's opinion regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their ability to work?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ improperly dismiss the claimant's reports of cognitive difficulties associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, contrary to the guidance provided in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ fail to consider the potential side effects of medications prescribed for chronic fatigue syndrome and their impact on the claimant's ability to maintain attention and concentration, as discussed in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ err in not addressing the claimant's need for workplace accommodations due to chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's daily activities and how chronic fatigue syndrome limits those activities, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p, and how did this affect the overall assessment?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ fail to consider the opinions of treating physicians regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their functional capacity?\\n\\n11. Did the ALJ err in not considering the impact of the claimant's diabetes mellitus on their ability to work, as required by SSR 14-2p, and how did this oversight affect the evaluation?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ adequately assess the interaction between the claimant's obesity and diabetes mellitus, as required by SSR 14-2p and SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ comply with SSR 14-2p in addressing whether the claimant's diabetes mellitus equals a listed impairment, and did the failure to do so warrant remand for further consideration?\\n\\n14. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, considering the overlap of symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome?\\n\\n15. Did the ALJ fail to consider the longitudinal record in evaluating the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia, as SSR 12-2p recognizes that symptoms can wax and wane, and was this a significant error?\\n\\n16. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's headaches in accordance with SSR 19-4p, particularly regarding the severity and impact on daily functioning?\\n\\n17. Did the ALJ ignore the claimant's interstitial cystitis and its potential impact on functional limitations, as outlined in SSR 15-1p, and how did this oversight affect the overall assessment of the claimant's impairments?\\n\\n18.

Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: and 416.1540.  This duty applie s at the Appeals Council (AC) if\\nthe evidence relates to the period on or before the date of the\\nadministr ative law judge (ALJ) decision (or the claimant’s date\\nlast insured, when applicable)”\\n \\nFor all regions, 20 C.F.R. § 405.401(c) provides that the Appeal s\\nCouncil:\\nwill consider additional evidence only where it relates to the period\\non or before the date of the hearing  decision, and only if you show\\nthat there is a reasonable probability  that the evidence, alone or\\nwhen considered with the other evidence of record, would chang e\\nthe outcome of the decision, and\\n(1) Our action misled y ou;\\n(2)You had a physical, menta l, educational, or linguistic\\nlimitati on(s) that prevented you from submitting  the evidence\\nearlier; or\\n(3)Some other unusual, unex pected, or unavoidable circumstance\\nbeyond your control prevented you from submitting  the\\nevidence earlier.\\nRepresentatives must also comply  with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1512(a),\\n416.912(a), which require that “you must bring  to our attention\\nevery thing  that shows that y ou are blind or disabled.”\\n4.The Appeals Council failed to proffer to claimant evidence received from a\\nsource, other than the claimant or their representative, associated with the\\nclaim(s) file.\\n5.The Appeals Council failed to offer a supplemental hearing  with proffered\\nevidence when the AC granted review and issued a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-3-6- 5(B) stated that  “When the AC initiates\\n225\\nown-motion review and remand s the case for a new hearing , the claimant’s\\nrights to a hearing  under Goldberg v. Kelly , 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and to\\nreview addit ional materials and evidence, will be satisfied as part of the new\\nhearing  before the Administrative Law Judge.”  Under HAL LEX I-3-8-10,\\nNotice To Claimant When Granting  Request For Review, if the AC is\\nremanding  a case to an ALJ, issuing a fully favorable decision, or issuing  a\\ndecision that is favorable in part and remanding  the remaining  issue(s) for\\nfurth er proceeding s, the AC’s final action constitutes notice of review and the\\nAC is not required to send a separate notice of review before issuing  the final\\naction document. (see also, HAL LEX I-3-6-5). However, when the AC grants\\nreview and proposes to issue an unfavorable decision, a partially  favorable\\ndecision (containing  unfavorable finding s), or to dismiss the request for\\nhearing , the AC must  issue a separate notice of review before taking  final\\naction. which will:\\n• State the reason(s) for the AC’s proposed action and the issue(s) to be\\nconsidered;\\n• Prov ide the claimant 30 days from the date of the notice to submit any\\nadditional evidence or written statement;\\n• Advise the claimant that they may request an appearance before the\\nAC; and\\n• When proffering  evidence, advise the claimant that they may request\\nthat the case be remanded to an AL J.\\nSee also HAL LEX I -3-9-84, Notice of Proposed Revision of Prior Decision.   \\nHAL LEX I-3-2-16 addresses proffering  evidence which is received by the\\nAppeals Council and  provides:\\nB. When the Appeals Council Proffers Evidence - Due to its appellate\\nfunction and the regulatory  standard for considering  additional evidence\\n(see 20 CFR 404.970 and 416.1470), the Appeals Counc il (AC) does not\\nproffer all evidence. The AC will proffer evidence that it receives from a\\nsource other than the claimant or the appointed representative, if any,\\nwhen that evidence is associated with the claim(s) file. The AC will not\\nproffer additional evidence when:\\n• The AC is using  the evidence to issue a fully  favorable decision;\\n•The evidence is for treatment of a common ailment (such as a cold\\nor the flu), and the AC finds it is reasonable to presume the ailment\\nis unrelated to the claimant’s alleg ed impairment(s) (i.e., the\\nevidence may be new and related to the period at issue, but it is not\\nmaterial as ex plained in HAL LEX I-3-3-6);\\n226\\n• The evidence is a list of prescribed medications (even when new,\\nmaterial and related to the period at issue);\\n• The evidence is substantively  the same as other evidence already\\nin the record (e.g., a nurse’s note duplica ting a doctor’s note that is\\nalready  part of the record); or\\n• The evidence is a duplicate copy  of evidence already  in the record.\\nNOTE:\\nAdditionally , the AC will not proffer evidence when it remands a case,\\nbecause the AC does not exhibit additional evidence on remand. Rather,\\nthe administrative law judge (ALJ) provides the claimant the opportunity\\nto review the additional evidence (see HAL LEX I -2-1-35).\\nC. When the AC Offers a Supplemental Hearing\\nThe AC will offer a supplemen tal hearing  with proffered evidence when\\nthe AC intends to grant review and issue a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision. In that circumstance, the AC will advise the claimant that he or\\nshe may  request that the AC remand the case to an AL J for a new hearing .\\nD.Proffering  Procedures\\nTo proffer evidence, the AC sends a proffer notice to the claimant and\\nappointed representative, if any. In the notice, the AC will generally  give\\nthe claimant 30 days from the date of the notice to object to, comment on\\nor refute the evidence, or to submit any other written statement about the\\nfacts or law that the claimant believes apply  in light of the evidence\\nsubmitted. When applicable (see above), the AC will also tell the claimant\\nthat within 30 days, he or she may ask the AC to remand the case to an\\nALJ for a new hearing .\\nWhen the AC initiates own-motion review based on a protest from an\\neffectuat ing component or Regional Commissioner’s office, the AC must\\nproffer the protest memorandum to the claimant and representative, if any,\\nunless the AC intends to issue a fully  favorable decisio n (HALLEX I-3-6-\\n20 B.2). In these cases, the AC must mail a copy of the protest\\nmemorandum to the claimant and representative, if any .\\nIn all other cases, the AC may follow the following  procedures when\\nproffer is required:\\n• If the claimant is represented and the claim( s) file is electronic, the\\nproffer notice will inform the representative that the new evidence\\nis available for review throug h the Appointed Representativ e\\nServices (ARS) portal.\\n• If the claimant is unrepresented and has a MySSA account and the\\n227\\nclaim(s) file is electro nic, Office of Appellate Operations (OAO)\\nstaff will provide a copy  of the new evidence to the claimant’s\\nMySSA messag e center. The proffer notice will inform the\\nclaimant that the evide nce is available to review on their MySSA\\naccount.\\n• OAO staff will proffer a copy of the new evidence by mail to the\\nclaimant and representative, if any , when:\\n\\\" The claimant is represented, but the claiman t’s representative\\ndoes not have access to the ARS portal;\\n\\\" The claimant is unrepres ented and does not have a My SSA\\naccount; or\\n\\\" The claim(s) file is in paper format.\\nThe AC must be mindful of new evidence that may be offensive or\\ndetrimental to the claima nt’s health. When the claimant is represented, the AC\\nmay elect to proffer the evidence only to the representativ e and advise the\\nrepresentative to exercise discretion in deciding  whether to show the claimant\\nthe eviden ce. When the claimant is unrepresented, the AC may proffer the\\nevidence throug h the claimant’s servicing  field office (F O). \\n6.The Appeals Council failed to conside r the claimant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving  additional evidence, because the AC did not assoc iate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-3-5-50, Appeals Council Receives Additional\\nEvidence After I ssuing  Denial of Request for Review provides:\\nC. Reviewing  the Additional Evidence\\n1. Evidence Submitted but Not Asso ciated Prior to Date of Denial\\nNotice - Occasionally , a claimant will submi t additional evidence for\\nAC review before the AC releases its denial notice, but the evidence is\\nnot associated with the file until after the AC releases its denial notice.\\nIn these instances, the AC must consider the claimant’s request for\\nreview ag ain.\\n2. Evidence Submitted on or After Date of Denial Notice - If the\\nclaimant submits evidence on or after the date of the denial notice, the\\nAC will not vacate its denial of the request for review. Rather, the AC\\ntreats the submission of additional evidence as an implied request for\\nreopening  of the administrative law judg e’s decision. \\n7.The Appeals Council must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice. \\n228\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX 1-3-5-50, Appeals Council Receives Additional\\nEvidence After I ssuing  Denial of Request for Review provides:\\nD. Other Request for Exhibits, Hearing  Recording (s), or Extension of\\nTime Received but Not Associated Prior to Date of Denial Notice\\nThe AC may also receive a request for exhibits, a hearing  recording, or an\\nextension of time before it releases its denial notice but does not associate\\nthe request with the file until after it releases its denial notice. In these\\ninstances, the AC must vacate the prior denial to consider the claimant’s\\nrequest for review again after the claimant has had an opportunity  to\\nreview and comment.\\n8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request  for review because the\\nreview  denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\nApplicable law :  HAL LEX I -3-5-25(A) provides:\\nA. General\\nThe purpose of denial notices is to notify the claimant that the Appeals\\nCouncil (AC) has not found a basis for granting  review. The AC will not\\nuse a denial notice to make substantive finding s, chang e the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, make substitute finding s, or in any other way revise an\\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) decision. If the AC needs to amend,\\nmodify , or change the substance in an ALJ decision, it must grant the\\nrequest for review.\\n9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.9 11, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nApplicable law: HAL LEX I-3-1-14 addressed requests for an extension of\\ntime (EOT)  to submit evidence or arguments to the Appeals Council (AC) in\\nsupport of a request for review.  HAL LEX I-3-1-14(A) states that the AC will\\naccept an extension request either in writing  or by telephone.  For an EOT\\nrequest, “the AC provides the claimant or appointe d representative 25 days\\nfrom the date of the notice granting  the EOT, even if the claimant or\\nappointed representative requests an EOT for more than 25 day s.” Id. \\nThis HAL LEX explains that when a subsequent extension request is made,\\n“the AC will consider whether the claimant or appointed representative\\nprovided good cause for requesting  a subsequent EOT” and will use the\\nstandards set forth  in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911 and 416.1411.67 Id. The Appeals\\n67see pages 212- 13, supra  for a discussion 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.131. \\n229\\nCouncil will deny  the extension request if it finds “there is no good cause” for\\nrequesting  a subsequ ent EOT request and will “continue processing  the\\nrequest for review.”  Id.  It is not alway s necessary  for the AC to respond to\\nan EOT request before performing  a substantive review as “[certain\\ncircumstances may  render the request moot.”  Id.\\nHAL LEX I -3-1-14(A) provides the following  example: \\nif the AC has received the additional evidence or arguments mentioned in\\nthe EOT request when the analy st examines the claim(s) file, the EOT\\nrequest may be moot. In these  circumstances the AC may address an\\ninitial or subsequent EOT request with its action on the request for review.\\nThe analy st will add the following  language to the action document,\\nmodified as appropriate: “On [date of request], a request was made for an\\nextension of time to submit additional evidence(A) and/or argument.\\nThese materials have been received. \\nHAL LEX I-3-1-14(B ) addresses procedures for processing  initial EOT\\nrequests and states: \\nThe AC’s notice granting  the initial EOT responds to all EOT requests\\nreceived on the case through the date of the notice.” NOTE: Unless the EOT\\nrequest is moot, when granting  the initial EOT request, the AC will provide\\n25 days for submission of additional evidence or argument even when the\\nclaim has been pending  before the AC for an extended time and OAO staff\\ndoes not discover the EOT request until after 25 days from the date of the\\ninitial request. \\nHAL LEX I-3-1-14(B ) also addresses procedures for processing  subsequent\\nEOT requests and states that if the AC determines good cause exists, it will\\nsend notice grantin g the subsequent EOT request. “The AC will provide the\\nclaimant and appointed representative, if any, an additional 30 days to submit\\nadditional evidence or argument on any subsequent EOT it grants.” Id. “If the\\nAC finds there is no good cause to provide an additional EOT, the AC will\\nissue a notice deny ing the EOT” and will “continue processing  the request for\\nreview following  the denial of any  subsequent EOT.” Id.\\nL. SUBSEQUENT APPL ICAT IONS \\n1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new\\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\nAppli cable law:  In SSR 11-1p, SSA announced that a claimant can\\nordinarily  no longer have a new disability  claim processed where another\\nclaim of the same type is still pending  at any level of administrative review. \\nSSR 11-1p explains that under the SSA’s new procedure, a claimant must\\n230\\nusually  choose between continuing  to pursue administrative review of a claim\\nand filing  a new claim of the same title and type.  According  to the Ruling ,\\nthis procedure is warranted in order to decrease administrative costs in the\\nface of increased applications, and due to a risk of improper payments\\nresulting  from the processing  of subsequent claims.  SSR 11-1p does not\\naffect claimants wishing  to file a subsequent  application once the prior claim\\nis on appeal in federal court.\\nThe Ruling  explains that new applications will ordinarily  no longer be\\naccepted while a “prior disability  claim is pending  administrative review,” but\\nthat a claimant can still provide SSA “with evidence that is relevant to\\npending  claim, in accordance with [its] existing  regulations and procedures.” \\nWhere a claimant submits evidence to the Appeals Council that is relevant\\nonly to the period after the ALJ’s decision , the Appeals Council will return\\nthe evidence to the claimant. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.976(b), 416.1476(b). \\nHowever, SSR 11-1p provides that if the eviden ce “shows a new critical or\\ndisabling  condition, and” the claimant informs SSA that he or she desires “to\\nfile a new claim based on this evidence, the Appeals Council may permit” the\\nfiling  of “a new disability  claim before it completes its action on [the\\nclaimant’s]  request for review of the pending  claim.”\\n2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim.\\nApplicable law:  Accor ding to SSR 11-1p, improved electronic handling  of\\ninformation has enab led SSA to “act on additional evidence promptly .” \\nMoreover, the Ruling  indicates SSA “will act expeditiously ” wher e “the\\nadditional evidence indicates a critical or dire need situation[ .]” What\\nconstitutes such a situation  is not defined by SSR 11-1p, but the Ruling  also\\nstates that review of the pending  claim will be expedited “[i]f the new and\\nmaterial evidence that relates to the period on or before the date of the hearing\\ndecision shows a critical or disabling  condition[ .]”\\n3.Submiss ion of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\n \\nApplicable law:  SSR 11-1p provides that evidence the Appeals Council\\ndeems unrelated to the period on or before the ALJ’s decision will be returned\\nto the claimant along  with a notice that “will explain why the Appeals Council\\ndid not accept the evidence and inform you that, under certain circumstances,\\nwe will consider the date you filed the request for Appeals Council review as\\nthe filing  date for y our new claim.”  The Ruling  goes on to ex plain that:\\nIf you originally  filed for disability  benefits under title II, and you file a\\nnew application for title II disabili ty benefits within six months of the date\\nof this notice, we will use the date of your request for Appeals Council\\n231\\nreview as the filing  date.  If both applications are for Supplemental\\nSecurity  Income payments based on disability  under title XVI, and you\\nfile the new application within 60 days from the date of the notice,  we will\\nuse the date you requested Appeals Council review as the filing date for\\nthe new claim.  We will permit the filing  of a new disability  claim after\\nthe Appeals Council completes its action on the request for review of the\\npending  claim.\\nM.RIGHT TO A HEARING  BEFORE A NE W ALJ\\n1.In accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\nApplicable law:  While the Hearing  Office Chief “generall y assigns cases to\\nALJs on a rotational basis, with the earliest (i.e., oldest) [request for hearing s]\\nreceiving priority , cases are assig ned in a different order where there is a\\n“special situation” requiring  a “change in the order in which a case is\\nassig ned.” HAL LEX I-2-1-55(A).68 Some of these “special situations”  involve\\n68 HAL LEX I -2-1-55(E) lists exceptions to case rotation in the following circumstances:\\n1. Assignment of New Claim Whe n Claimant Voluntarily Withdraws [request for hearing “(RH”)]\\nIf a claimant voluntarily asks to withdraw his or her RH a fter an AL J has been assigned to the case,\\nand the ALJ grants the claimant’s request (see HALLEX I-2-4-20), except in the circumstances noted\\nin subsection F, the same ALJ will generally be assigned if the claimant later submits a RH on a new\\napplication.\\nNOTE:\\nIf the previous ALJ has transferred to another office or is otherwise unavailable (see HAL LEX I-2-8-\\n40), the case may be assigned to a different ALJ. However, a change in the claimant’s address will\\nnot necessarily necessitate a change in the assigned AL J. Se e HAL LEX I -2-0-70 and I -2-3-10.\\nCheck the Case Processing and Management System (CPMS)  entry for the case to confirm that the\\nprior dismissal was based on the claimant’s voluntary withdrawal of his or her RH.  The status field\\nshould display the “WDDI ” withdrawal dismissal code.  Check the decision maker field for the name\\nof the ALJ who issued that dismissal.\\n Assignment of Case Whe n Claimant Withdraws Appl ication\\nIf an ALJ has been assigned to a case and the claimant withdraws his or her application, the same\\nALJ will be assigned if the claimant submits a RH o n a new application. \\nNOTE:   \\nSee HAL LEX 1-2-4-22 Claimant Reque sts Withdrawal of Appli cation (6/24/21) for guidance on\\napplication withdrawal. If an ALJ has already issued a decision or order of dismissal, an ALJ will\\nnot accept a request to withdraw the application. However, a claimant may submit a written request\\nto cancel the request to withdraw the application within 60 days of the date the request was approved.\\n232\\nassig ning a  case to a new AL J. See HAL LEX I -2-1-55(D). These include:\\n•In time-limited court remand cases, where a “court has ordered the\\nCommissioner to complete one or more specific actions within a set\\ntime period,” the cases must be assigned immediately .  These cases\\n“are generally  assigned to the same ALJ who issued the decision or\\ndismissal,  unless the AC or court specifically  directs otherwise, or the\\nALJ is no long er with the ag ency .”\\n•A delay ed court remand case which is defined as a “case is over 125\\ndays old (counting  from the date of the court’s order) or a court\\nremand that the AC remanded to an ALJ a second time.” These cases\\nmust be assigned immediately . “If the AC remanded a second time,\\nassig n to a different AL J.”\\n•Other court remand cases must also be assig ned immediately .  “If the\\nAC remanded a second time, assig n to a different AL J.”\\n•Non-court AC remands must also be assig ned immediately  and are\\n“assigned to the same ALJ who issued the decision or dismissal\\nunless:\\n•the case was previously  assig ned to that ALJ on a prior remand\\nfrom the AC and the ALJ’s decision or dismissal after remand is\\nthe subject of the new AC remand; or\\n•the AC directs the case be assig ned to a different AL J \\n    \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-55(D)(Note) further provides:\\nAC remands for decisions or dismissals issued by National Hearin g Center\\n(NHC) ALJs are sent to the HO servicing  the claimant’s current address.\\nIf the NHC is still providing  assistance to the HO and the NHC ALJ is\\ncurrently  on duty in the same NHC, the case may be assig ned to the NHC\\nALJ unless the claimant has filed a timely  objection to appearing at the\\nhearing  by VTC.  See HAL LEX I -2-0-21.\\nHALLEX I-2-1-55(F )(1) provides that in those cases where a hearing  has yet\\nto be held, a HOCAL J “may reassig n a case to a different ALJ” in the\\nfollowing  circumstances:\\n•When it is necessary to ensure that the claimant will have his or her\\ncase heard or decided in a timely  manner;\\n•The ALJ who was assig ned the case initially  is not available to\\nconduct the hearing  because of death, retirement, resig nation, illness,\\nSee 20 CFR 404.641 a nd 416.360. \\n233\\nor other cause resulting  in prolong ed absence of 20 or more day s; or\\n•The ALJ who was assigned the case is unavailable on short notice to\\nconduct the hearing .\\nHALLEX I-2-1-55(F )(2) provides that in those cases after a hearing  has been\\nheld, the case may be reassig ned if the ALJ has not approved a draft decision\\nand must consider “whether the delay  in issuing  a decision constitutes a\\ndetriment to the public.”  If the case is reassig ned, “the ALJ to whom the case\\nis reassig ned will review all the evidence of record, including  the audio\\nrecording  of the hearing ”.  If a fully favorable decision will be issued, the ALJ\\nneed not conduct another hearing .  The ALJ “may find another hearing  is\\nnecessary  if, for example, relevant expert evidence was needed but was not\\nobtained at the hearing , or the ALJ needs additional testimo ny to fully\\nevaluate a claimant’s alleg ations of pain and other sy mptoms.”  Id.\\nFinally , the “HOCAL J or other manag ement ALJ may also determine that a\\nreassig nment and case transfer are appropriate if the claimant chang es\\nresidence while the request  for hearing  is pending . See HAL LEX I-2-3-11.” \\nHAL LEX I -2-1-55(F )(2)(NOTE).\\n2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeal s Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. 404.940 and 416.1440.  \\nApplicable law:  HALLEX I-3-7-14(H) addresses “Unfair Hearing\\nAlleg ations” and provides that when the record supports a claimant’s\\nalleg ation “that the hearing  was unfair and the record demonstrates that the\\nALJ abused his or her discretion, the AC will grant review,  and, when remand\\nis appropriate, remand  the case to a different ALJ.  See HAL LEX I-3-2-25\\nand I -3-3-2.”\\nN. DUTY TO FOLLOW APPE ALS CO UNCIL  REMAND O RDERS\\n1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that on remand from the Appeals\\nCouncil, “[t]he administrative law judge shall take any action that is ordered\\nby the Appeals Council and may take any additional action that is not\\ninconsistent with the Appeals Council’s remand order.”  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.977(b), 416.1577(b) (emphasis added).\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-85(A) provides that an ALJ “may seek clarification of an\\nAppeals Council (AC) remand order” only  when:\\n234\\n•The ALJ cannot carry out the directive(s) set forth in the remand\\norder;69 or \\n•The directive(s) in the remand order appears to have been rendered\\nmoot.70\\n69 HAL LEX I-2-1-85(C) (1) provides that an ALJ may not be able to carry out a directive in the following\\nsituations:\\n  \\n•The directive(s) violates law or agency policy, or carrying out the directive(s) may require the\\nALJ to violate law or agency policy;\\n•The directive(s), if followed, would cause inordinate delay in a claim or be unne cessarily\\nburde nsome; or\\n•The directive(s) is based on a factual or clerical error, and the error results in a directive(s) that\\ncannot be carried out or a directive(s) that is uncl ear based on the actual facts.\\nThe following are examples of valid clarification requests:\\n•The AC directs the ALJ to request a consultative examination to evaluate the claimant’s mental\\nimpairments. The claimant is in a confinement facility for an extended period of time, and the\\nfacility will not allow a consultative examination while the claimant is confined.\\n•The AC directs the ALJ to obtain a hearing test and examination performed by a qualified\\notolaryngologist but there is no otolaryngologist in the area servicing the HO.\\n•The AC reman d directs the ALJ to consider the findings of a prior ALJ decision, but the AC\\nmade an error and no  prior ALJ decision was issued.  \\nThis HAL LEX further states that an ALJ may “only request clarification based on a clerical or factual\\nerror in the AC remand order if the error is substantive and directly related to a specific directive”\\nand “[d]isagreement with an aspect of the remand order does not constitute a factual error.”  Id.  The\\nHALLEX goes on to list specific examples of clarification requests that are valid, including a\\ndisagreement about the AC’s finding of good cause for a claimant not appearing at a hearing, or the\\nremand order failing to cite a regulatory basis for granting review, or the AC not explaining the basis\\nfor needing a medical expert, or the directive was issued by a federal court, or the ALJ previously\\nreceived conflicting instructions on another case.  \\n70 HAL LEX I -2-1-85(C)(2) provides examples of when a directive appears to be rendered moot: \\n  A change in circumstance or an error of fact may make a directive(s) obsolete in some instances.  The\\nfollowing are examples of valid requests for clarification in these circumstances:\\n•The AC remands a case for a new hearing solely because the hearing recording cannot be\\nlocated. The hearing recording is subsequently found and is determined to be audible, and a new\\nhearing has not yet been hel d.\\n•The AC remands a case to determine the identity and Social Security num ber (SSN)  of the wage\\nearner on whose record the claimant may apply for benefits.  On remand, the HO discovers a\\nclerical error resulted in the entering of an incorrect digit in the SSN in the Case Processing and\\n235\\nALJs may not seek clarification of AC remand orders under any other\\ncircumstances.71\\nIf the “AC accepts a clarification request, it will vacate its remand order and\\nissue a new action.”  HALLEX I-2-1-85(A).  Since the AC will not vacate a\\nremand order after an ALJ holds a new hearing, “if an ALJ intends to request\\nclarification from the AC, he or she must submit the request before\\nconducting  a hearing  (and whenever possible, before scheduling  a hearing ).” \\nId.\\nHAL LEX I-2-1-85(A)(Note) also provides that while the criteria for clarification\\nmay not be present, feedback to the AC may  be appropriate:\\nIf the AC remand order itself is unclear, may demonstrate inconsistent\\napplication of policy  by the AC, or, while technically  correct, contains\\ninsig nificant errors that would not likely  result in a Federal court remand, the\\nALJ can refer the case throug h the AC feedback initiative, as explained in\\nHAL LEX I -2-1-88.\\nO.ALJ BIAS, PRE JUDICE , OR FAIL URE TO FOLLOW\\nPROCEDURE S\\n1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council shou ld issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-1p describes the process es for handling  alleg ations\\nof ALJ unfairness, prejudice, partiality , bias, misconduct, or discrimination. It\\nprovides, in part, that a party  may ask for review by the Appeals Council\\nwhere an ALJ refuses to withdraw despite the party’s objection. Id. Based on\\ninformation in the administrative record, the Appeals Counci l will apply  the\\nabuse of discretion standard and may provide a new decision on the claim or\\nremand for further proceeding s. Id.\\nManagement System (CPMS)  and the HO c orrected the error.\\n71See also HAL LEX I-2-1-86 (Formal Requests for Clarification - Procedures) which sets forth the specific\\nprocedures for communicating with the Appe als Council and emphasizes that the ALJ or designated hearing\\noffice staff, “who wants to request formal clarification of an AC remand order must communicate with the\\nAC only as set forth” in HAL LEX I-2-1-86.  This HAL LEX provides that HO staff and ALJs may not directly\\ncontact AC adjudicators regarding specific cases, regardless of whether the case is pending at the AC or at\\nthe HO.  Under HAL LEX I-2-1-86 there are two required steps to obtain formal clarification from the AC:\\n• First, an AL J must obtain appro val from HO m anagement to request clarification; and\\n• Second, if HO management appro ves, the ALJ must submit the request to the AC and obtain\\na response from the AC be fore acting on the hearing level case. \\n236\\nThe Ruling  provides  that after being  presented with objections, the Appeals\\nCouncil will review the allega tions and ALJ decision under the abuse of\\ndiscretion standard. An abuse of discretion takes place where: (1) the ALJ’s\\naction is erroneous  and without rational basis; (2) the ALJ’s action is clearly\\nnot justified under the circumstances; (3) certain failures to follow required\\nprocedures has occurred; or (4) the evidence of record shows the ALJ was\\nprejudiced or partial, or had an interest in the pending  matter. Id.\\nHAL LEX I-3-7- 14(H) addresses “Unfair Hearing  Alleg ations” and discusses\\nhow the Appeal s Council addresses these alleg ations and the circumstances\\nwhen the Appeals Council will direct the assig nment of the case to a new\\nALJ. HAL LEX I -3-7-14 (H) states:\\nWhen a claimant alleg es the hearing  was unfair and the record\\ndemonstr ates that the ALJ abused his or her discretion, the AC will grant\\nreview, and, when remand is appropriate, remand the case to a different\\nALJ. See HAL LEX I -3-2-25 and I -3-3-2.\\n2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidenced  by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 13-1p describes three distinct processes  for evaluating\\nunfair hearing s: \\nAll adjudicators, including  our ALJs, must fulfill  their duties with fairness\\nand impartiality . We have three separate processes to guard against\\nunfairness in our hearing  process: (1) the Appeals Council review process,\\nunder which we review hearing  decisions in accordance with 20 C.F.R.\\n404.969, 404.970, 416.1469 and 416.1470, to ensure that ALJs fairly  and\\nimpartial ly consider claims for benefits; (2) the Division of Quality\\nService’s ALJ complaint investig ation process; and (3) the civil rights\\ninvestig ation process for alleg ations of discrimination involving\\nunfairness, prejudice, partiality , or bias based on race, color, national\\norigin (including  English language ability ), religion, sex, sexual\\norientation, age, disability, or in retaliation for having  previously  filed a\\ncivil rights complaint. These three processes operate separately  from one\\nanother and have different focuses.\\nHAL LEX I-3-2-25 states that bias includes egregious conduct, which is\\ndefined as conduct that shows unfairness, prejudice, partiality , bias,\\nmisconduct, discrimination, or equivalent.\\n3.The languag e of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decisio n as a forum for criticiz ing [the agency ,\\nagency  policy or procedure, other government agencies, the courts, the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] .\\n237\\n4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.  \\nApplicable law:  HAL LEX I-2-8-25 discusses the language and style of\\ndecisions and provides that:\\nWhen writing  or reviewing  a draft decision, an AL J will not use:\\n•Emotionally  charg ed words, disapproving  or derog atory  terms, or\\npersonal judg ments or opinions;\\n•Medical tex ts or publications as the authority  for resolving  an issue;\\n•Non-prescribed standardiz ed lang uage in the rationale; or\\n•The decision as a forum for criticizing the agency , agency  policy  or\\nprocedure, other government agencies, the courts, the representative,\\nor the claimant.\\nP. REDETERMINATIONS DUE  TO FRAUD O R SIM ILAR\\nFAUL T\\n1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding  of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n  2.The ALJ’s finding that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar faul t\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\n  3.The ALJ failed to apply the applicable standard for excluding  evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable ground s to suspect, that\\nthe person knew  the evidence provided was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n 4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there  was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.   \\n 5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason]  into\\naccount in excluding  evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided. \\n6.The ALJ failed to comply  with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermin ation of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p. \\n238\\n7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n8.The notice of determi nation or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficie nt because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencies prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision. \\nApplicable law :  42 U.S.C. 405(u)(1) g overning  redetermination provides:\\n(A)  The Commi ssioner of Social Security  shall immediately  redetermine\\nthe entitlement of individuals to monthly  insurance benefits under this\\nsubchapter if there is reason to believe that fraud or simil ar fault was\\ninvolved in the application of the individual for such benefits, unless a\\nUnited States attorney, or equivalent State prosecutor, with jurisdiction\\nover potential or actual related criminal cases, certifies, in writing , that\\nthere is a substantial risk that such action by the Commissioner of Social\\nSecurity  with regard to beneficiaries in a particular investig ation woul d\\njeopardiz e the criminal prosecution of a person involved in a suspected\\nfraud.\\n(B)When redetermining  the entitlement, or making  an initial\\ndetermination of entitlement, of an individual under this subch apter, the\\nCommissioner of Social Securit y shall disreg ard any evidence if there is\\nreason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in the providing\\nof such evidence.\\n42 U.S.C. 405(u)(1). \\nFormer SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p were rescinded and replaced with SSR 22-\\n1p and SSR 22-2p, effective May 17, 2022. SSR 22-1p (Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations) and SSR 22-2p (Evaluation of Claims Involving  the\\nIssue of Similar Fault in the Prov iding of Evidence).72   explain that the\\n72Following the issuance of SSR 22-1p and 22-2p, SSA issued numerous HAL LEX providing guidance\\nregarding these new rulings.  The following HAL LEX issued on June 7, 2022, are related to SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22- 2p: \\n•I-1-3-15 (Adjudicating Fraud or Similar Fault Issues) \\n•I-1-3-25 (Processi ng Cases Unde r Sections 205(U) and 1631( E) (7) of the Social Security Act\\n(Fraud or Similar Fault “Redeterminations”) \\n•I-1-3-26 (Processing Non-Redetermination Fraud or Similar Fault Cases and Disregarding\\nEvidence Unde r Sections 205( U)(1)(B) and 1631( E)(7)(A)(II) of The Social Security Act)\\n•I-2-10-1 (Overview) \\n•I-2-10-6 (Notice of Hearing ) \\n•I-2-1010 ( Considering Evidence Whe n Fra ud or Similar Fault Is Involved) \\n239\\nevidentiary  standard for fraud and similar fault is revised from  a\\n“preponderance of the evidence” to “reason to believe” to align more closely\\nwith the standard provided in the Social Security  Act.  Additionally , the\\nRuling s set forth a new procedure which provides that, before SSA will\\ndisreg ard evidence under the Act at the hearing s level of the administra tive\\nreview  process, SSA will consider the individual’s objection to the\\ndisreg arding  of that evidence. \\n  SSA expects that these revised procedures will allow implementation of\\nrelevant sections of the Act in a manner consistent with the decisions of the\\nCourts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the procedures\\noutlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. \\nProcess for redeterm ining the entitlem ent to benef its.  SSR 22-1p sets\\nforth the process for redetermining  for redetermining  an individua l’s\\nentitlement to monthly  insurance benefits under Title II or eligibility  for\\npayments under Title XVI of the Act and provides “we will immediately\\nredetermine an individual’s entitlement to benefi ts or eligibility  for payments\\nwhen there is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in an\\nindividual’s application for benefits or payments, including  the provid ing of\\nevidence.” SSR 22-2p sets forth the process for evaluating  and adjudi cating\\nclaims in which “there is reason to believe similar fault was involved  in the\\nproviding  of evidence to us in support of a claim for benefits under title II or\\npayments under title XVI of the Social Security  Act (Act).” Whenever such\\nreason exists, the Social Security  Independence and Program Improvements\\nAct of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §§ 405(u), 1383(e)(7), provides for an immediate\\nredetermination. \\nDuring  the redetermination, SSR 22-1p provides the SSA disreg ards evidence,\\nfrom any individual or entity , as to which “there is reason to believe that fraud\\nor similar fault was involved in providing  that evidence.” This includes: \\nevidence supplied, prepared, or signed by a medical source or nonmedical\\nsource when there is a reason to believe that the source knowing ly (1)\\nprovided incorrect or incomplete evidence material to the determination or\\ndecision or (2) concealed or failed to disclose evidence material to the\\n•I-2-10-14 (Writing A Decision When Fraud or Similar Fault Is At Issue) I-2-10-16\\n(Adm inistrative Sanction Cases) \\n•1-3-10-1 (Overview) \\n•I-3-10-5 (Appe als Council Final Actions Whe n a Fraud or Similar Fault Issue Is Raised)\\n \\nThe following HAL LEX issued on June  28, 2022, a re also related to SSR 22- 1p and SSR 22-2p:  \\n•I-1-3-30 (Referring Non-compliant Excluded Medical Sources of Evidence to the Office of the\\nInspector General)\\n•I-2-5-15 (Excluded Me dical Sources of Evidence) \\n•I-3-2-36 (Excluded Me dical Sources of Evidence) \\n240\\ndetermination or decision, even if it includes a report prepared or signed\\nby another source. \\nUnder SSR 22-2p, SSA disreg ards evidence due to similar fault “if there is\\nreason to believe, meaning reasonable grounds to suspect, that the person\\nknew the evidence provided was false or incomplete or that the information\\nthat was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.” \\nSSR 22-2p makes a significant chang e to the effect that a finding  of similar\\nfault will have on other claims by eliminating  the language in former SSR 16-\\n2p that: \\na finding  of similar fault concerning  a material fact may constitute\\nevidence to be considered in determining  whether there is reason to\\nbelieve that similar fault was involved with respect to other evidence\\nprovided by the same source, and may justify  disreg arding  other evidence\\nfrom that source. Also, the evidence relied on to make a finding of similar\\nfault in one claim may be considered in deciding  whether there is similar\\nfault in another claim or in deciding  whether to give less weig ht to\\nevidence in another claim. \\n  SSR 22-1p also provides that after determining what evidence is to be\\ndisreg arded, the adjudicator then considers eligibility  for benefits in light of\\nthe remaining  evidence, including  evidence not presented previously  and\\nevidence post-dating  the original allowance so long  as it relate s to the period\\nat issue. This includes evidence included in the record at the time of the\\noriginal favorable determination or decision, along  with evidence provided\\nduring  the redetermination process. When requested, SSA will help\\nindividuals obtain evidence relevant to the redetermination. If the remaining\\nevidence  does not support benefit entitlement or eligibility  at the time of the\\noriginal allowance, the agency “may  terminate such entitlement or eligibility\\nand may treat benefits paid or payments made based on such evidence as\\noverpay ments.” \\nDefinitions of fraud , similar fault, material, know ingly, and “reason to\\nbelieve”  \\n•Fraud. Fraud exists when a person, with the intent to defraud, either\\nmakes or causes to be made, a false statement or misrepresentation of\\na material fact for use in determining  rights under the Act; or conceals\\nor fails to disclose a material fact for use in determining  rights under\\nthe Act. \\n•Similar Fault . Similar fault is involved with respect to a determination\\nif: “an incorrect or incomplete statement that is material to the\\ndetermination is knowing ly made or information that is material to the\\ndetermination is knowing ly concealed.”\\n241\\n•Material. Material describes a statement or informatio n, or an\\nomission from a statement or information that could influence us in\\ndetermining  entitleme nt to benefits under title II or eligibility  for\\nbenefits under title XVI  of the Act. \\n•Knowingly . Knowing ly describes a person’s awareness or\\nunderstanding  regarding  the correctness or completeness of the\\ninformation he or she provides us, or the materiality  of the information\\nhe or she conceals from us. \\n•Reason to Believe. Reason to believe means reasonable grounds to\\nsuspect that fraud or similar fault was involved in the application or\\nthe provision of evidence. The reason to believe standard requires\\nmore than mere suspicion, speculation, or a hunch, but it does not\\nrequire a preponderance of evidence. \\nException to immediate redeterm ination . SSR 22-1p notes that the Social\\nSecurity  Independence and Prog ram Impro vements Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. §§\\n405(u), 1383(e)(7), provides for an immediate redeterm ination with one\\nexception: when a prosecutor “with jurisdiction over potential or actual\\nrelated criminal cases, certifies, in writing , that there is a substantial risk that\\n[the agency’s] action with regard to beneficiaries or recip ients in a particular\\ninvestig ation would jeopardiz e the criminal prosecution of a person involved\\nin a suspected fraud.” Id. \\nIndividual receiving benef its need not be the one who committed the\\nfraud or similar fault.   Individual receiving  al SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p\\nexplain that for SSA to disre gard evidence it is not necessary  that the affected\\nbenefici ary or recipient had knowledg e of or participated in the fraud or\\nsimilar fault and that SSA will document the record with the description of the\\ndisreg arded evidence and the reasons for disreg arding  the evidence.  SSR 22-\\n1p and SSR 22-2p also explain that in certain circumstances, SSA may\\ndisregard evidence provided by someone who has not committed fraud or\\nsimilar fault, but whose evidence relies on other evidence invol ving fraud or\\nsimilar fault. For example, SSA may disre gard parts of a medical source’s\\nopinion, which relies on evidence that SSA disreg arded from another medical\\nsource. Depending  on the extent to which the medical source relied on the\\ndisregarded evidence, SSA may disreg ard some or all of the medical source’ s\\nopinion. \\n Scope of evidence to be considered on redetermination.  When\\nredetermining  a claim, additional evidence is to be considered so long as it is\\nrelevant. SSR 22-1p provides that after determining  what evidence is to be\\ndisreg arded, the adjudicator then considers eligibility  for benefits in light of\\nthe remaining  evidence, including  evidence not presented previously  and\\nevidence post-dating  the original allowance so long as it relates to the period\\nat issue. \\n242\\nSSR 22-1p and SSR-22-2p provide that generally , a finding  that there is\\nreason to believe fraud or similar fault was involved in providing evidence\\ndoes not constitute complete adjudicative action in any claim. Even if SSA\\ndisreg ards evidence, SSA will evaluate the remaining  evidence of record and\\ndetermine whether that evidence supports  a finding of entitlement to benefits\\nor eligibility  for payments.  SSR 22-1p is phrased permissively  with regard to\\ncircumstances where the remaining  evidence does not support benefit\\nentitlement or eligibility  at the time of the original allowance.  In such cases,\\nthe agency  “may  terminate such entitlement or eligibility and may treat\\nbenefits paid or pay ments made based on such evidence as overpay ments.”\\nProcedural requirem ents in f raud and sim ilar f ault cases \\nSSR 22-1p and 22-2p acknowledg e that an adjudicator must adhere to due\\nprocess and confiden tiality requirements and must consider all record\\nevid ence before determining  whether specific evidence may be disreg arded. \\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p revise the evidenti ary standard for fraud and\\nsimilar fault from a “preponderance of the evidence” to “reason to believe” to\\nalign more closely  with the standard provided in the Act. “Reason to believe”\\nmeans reaso nable grounds to suspect that fraud or similar fault was involved\\nin the appl ication or in the provision of evidence. The “reason to believe\\nstandard” requires more than mere suspicion, speculation, or a hunch, but it\\ndoes not require a preponderance of evidence. \\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p provide that before evidence  can be disreg arded,\\nthe individual’s objection to the disreg arding  of that evidence will be\\nconsidered. After considering  any objections, adjudicators will decide whether\\nthere is reason to believe that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing\\nevidence in the individual’s case. \\nDocum entary and analytical responsibilities of  adjudicators \\n Under SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p, adjudicators will consider all evidence i n\\nthe case   record before determining  whether specific evidence must be\\ndisreg arded. SSR 22-2p   provides: \\nIn determining  if there is reason to believe fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved, adjud icators may make reasonable inferences based on the\\ntotality  of the circumstances such as facts or case characteristics common\\nto patterns of known or suspected fraudulent activity . . . . Adjudicators\\nwill fully  document the record with the description of the disreg arded\\nevidence and the reasons for disreg arding  the evidence. \\n  SSR  22-2p provides that in determinations or decisions that involve a finding\\nof similar fault and disreg arding  evidence, the notice of determin ation or\\ndecision must:\\n \\n 1) Explain the applicable provisio n of the Act that allows the adjudicator to\\ndisreg ard particular evidence due to a similar fault finding . \\n243\\n2)  Identify  the documents or other evidence that is being  disreg arded. \\n3)  Provide a discussion of the evidence that supports a finding  to disregard\\nevidence. The discussion must explain that, in accordance with the law,\\nthe evidence identified cannot be used as evidence in a claim because,\\nafter considering  all the information in the case record, the adjudicator has\\nreason to believe that similar fault was involved in providing  the evide nce.\\nA similar fault finding  can be made only if there is reason to believe the\\nperson knew that the evidence provided was false  or incomplete. A similar\\nfault finding  cannot be based on speculation or suspicion. \\n4) Provide a determination or decision based on an evaluation of the\\nremaining  evidence in accordance with other rules and procedures. A\\nsimilar fault finding  does not constitu te complete adjudicative action in\\nany claim. A person may still be found entitled to benefits or eligible for\\npayments desp ite that some evidence in the case record has been\\ndisreg arded based on similar fault. For example, a person may be found to\\nbe under a disability  based on impairments that are estab lished by\\nevidence that is not disreg arded because of similar fault. \\n5) Include standard appeal lang uage. \\n \\nAppeal rights in redeterm ination cases \\n SSR 22-1p and 22-2p e xplain that an individual may appeal a finding  of fraud\\nor similar fault, and together with the appeal object to a findi ng to disreg ard\\nevidence, may appeal a deter mination that the remaining  evidence does not\\nsupport entitlement or eligibility , and may appeal any overpay ments assessed\\nin accordance with SSA’s rules for administrative review.  SSR 22-1p\\nprovides that an individual may, in accordance with the usual rules governing\\noverpay ments, also request waiver of an overpay ment from the ag ency. \\nSuccessf ul challenges to f ormer SSR 16-1p and 16-2p \\nAs noted in SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p, the rescission and revision of SSR 16-\\n1p and  SSR 16- 2p were made by SSA due to Court challeng es. A decision\\nfrom the Sixth   Circuit found the redetermination process in violation of the\\nDue Process Clause and the Administrative Procedu res Act. See Hicks v.\\nComm’r of Soc. Sec., 909 F.3d 786 (6th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc den. (Mar.\\n29, 2019). Acquiescence Ruling  19-1(6), discussed below, was issued in\\nresponse to Hicks , and to date AR 19-1(6) has not been rescinded. The\\nSeventh Circuit also has found the redeterm ination proceeding s flawed\\nbecause the SSA did not provide the claimant an opportunity  to rebut\\nevidence of fraud before excluding  a physician’s report. See Jason v. Saul,\\n970 F.3d 775 (7th Cir. 2020). The Fourth Circuit also has also held the\\nredetermination process in violation of the Due Process Clause and\\nAdministrative Procedures Act in Kirk v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin ., 987\\nF.3d 314 (4th Cir. 2021). SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p now contain provisions\\nthat address these Court challeng es. \\n244\\n  District courts in several jurisdictions also faced challenges to the\\nredetermination   proceeding s under former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p, that\\nare now addressed by SSR 22-1p and 22-2p. See, e.g., Jeannie S. v. Saul, No.\\n1:16-CV-04681-L AW (N.D. Ga. Mar. 3, 2020) (unpub.); Tyler J. v. Saul, No.\\n17-cv-50090, 2019 WL 3716817, at *4-*8 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 7, 2019); Kirk v.\\nBerryhill , 388 F. Supp. 3d 652, 662-65 (D.S.C. 2019); Agosto v. Comm’r of\\nSoc. Sec., No. 18-cv-1271, 2019 WL 6190612,  at *5-*6 (D.P.R. Nov. 20,\\n2019); Picon- Gonzalez v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Adm in., No. 18- cv-1016,\\n2019  WL 4187701, at *10-16 (D.P.R. Sept. 4, 2019); Correa v. Saul, No. 18-\\n24536-CI V, 2020 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 8625, at *34 (S.D. F la. Jan. 15, 2020). \\n Acquiescence Ruling 19-1(6) \\nAR 19-1(6) acquiesces in the Sixth Circuit decision issued in Hicks v.\\nComm’r of Soc. Sec., 909 F.3d 786 (6th Cir. 2018), reh’g en banc den. (Mar.\\n29, 2019) for claims within the Sixth Circuit (states of Kentucky , Michig an,\\nOhio, or Tennessee), and provides that for such claims, SSA will offer an\\nopportunity  to rebut alleg ations of fraud involvement. See also HAL LEX I-5-\\n4- 74 (“Implementation of The Hicks Acquiescenc e Ruling  (Sixth Circuit)”).73\\nThis is consistent with the revisions made to former SSR 16-1p and 16- 2p by\\nSSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.  \\nContrary  to SSA policy , the court in Hicks held that before disreg arding\\nevidence during  a redetermination, the Commissio ner must supply  a factual\\nbasis for believing  fraud was involved in providing  evidence . Hicks,  909 F.3d\\nat 799. Moreover, plaintiffs must have a chance to rebut the Commissioner’s\\nassertions before a neutral decisionmaker. Id. AR 19-1(6) applies only to\\ncases in which evidence is disreg arded based on a referral from Office  of\\nInspector General (OIG) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-8(1) ; however, similar\\nprovisions in SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p do not require such referral. \\nIn cases where the affected individual resides in Kentucky , Michig an, Ohio,\\nor Tennessee at the time SSA makes its hearing -level decisi on, it must now\\nsupply  notice of the factual basis for belie ving that fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved in providing  evidence. See Hicks , 909 F.3d at 799. In Hicks,  the\\nSixth Circuit explained that the Supreme Court has long “reco gnized the\\n‘immutable’ principle that ‘where governmental action seriously  injures an\\nindividual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact finding s, the\\nevidence used to prove the Government’s case must be disclosed to the\\nindividual[ .]’” Id. at 797 (quoting  Greene v. McElroy , 360 U.S. 474, 496\\n(1959)). SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p now apply  this notice and disclosure\\nprinciple in all jurisdictions. \\nIn the Sixth Circuit, individuals must be given a chance to rebut assertions of\\nfraud or  similar fault. While a claimant need not have played a role in the\\n73[Editor’s note: The provision in AR 19- 1(6) that for claimants outside of the Sixth Circuit the agency will\\ncontinue to ignore objections to SSA disregarding the evidence appears to be overruled by SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22- 2p].\\n245\\nfraud or similar  fault, he or she must have “an opportunity  to show that it is\\nuntrue.’” Hicks,  909 F.3d at 797 (quoting  Greene,  360 U.S. at 496). The\\nRuling  thus specifies that SSA must provide the claimant with an oppor tunity\\nto challeng e the agency ’s reason to believe that fraud or simila r fault was\\ninvolved in the provision of evidence. Moreover, the opportunity  for rebuttal\\nmust be held before a neutral decis ionmaker. Citing  the plurality  opinion in\\nHamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507, 533 (2004), the Hicks  court determined that\\nan individual’s opportunity  to rebut the Government’s factual assertions must\\noccur before a neutral decisionmaker. Hicks, 909 F.3d at 797. SSR 22-1p and\\nSSR 22-2p now apply  this opportunity  to object before an adjudicator and on\\nappeal to all jurisdictions.\\nTem porary Instructions f or Im plem entation of  AR 19-1(6)\\n HALLEX I-5-4-74, was issued March 13, 2020, as a Temporary  Instruction\\nproviding  guidance for implementing  AR 19-1(6). I t provides, in summary : \\n  •Upon receipt of a sentence four Hicks court remand, the AC will issue\\na remand order instructing  an ALJ to conduct a hearing  and issue a\\nnew decision on the issue of disability  during  the period on or before\\nthe date of the orig inal allowance. \\n  \\n  •The ALJ will determine whether there is reason to believe fraud or\\nsimilar fault was involved in the providing  of evidence in support of\\nthe beneficiary  or recipient’s application for disability  benefits. \\n  \\n•The ALJ will consider all evidence that is new, material, and related to\\nthe period at issue including  evidence the beneficiary  or recipient\\nobtained from the Receivers previously  associated with his or her file\\nin the office of his or her former representative.\\n•ALJs must issue decisions in cases rema nded for further\\nadministrative actions under AR 19-1(6). \\nUnder no circumstances can ALJs dismiss the requests for hearing  in these\\ncases. If the beneficiary  or recipient fails to appear and does not establish\\ngood cause or waives or constructively  waives the right to appear at the\\nhearing , the ALJ will issue a decision on the record. The ALJ may choose to\\nproceed with the hearing  if witness testimony  is necessary  to resolve the case.\\nIf an appointe d representative appears without the beneficiary  or recipient, the\\nALJ will allow the appointed representative to question witnesses and make\\narguments on the beneficiary  or recipient’s behalf. \\n  Upon receipt of the AC remand order, SRC staff will send the beneficiary or\\nrecipient an acknowledg ment letter and proffer the OIG Affidavit as well as\\nany other evidence related to the issue of whether fraud or similar fault was\\ninvolved in the providing  of evidence. The OIG Affidavit will contain the\\nfactual basis for the OIG’s investig ation and the reason to believe that fraud\\n246\\nwas involved in the application or in the providing  of evidence. \\n•  The acknowledgment letter will provide the benefic iary or recipient\\nand representative the opportunity to submit written objections to the\\nproffered evidence at least 5 business days before the scheduled\\nhearing ; provide the beneficiary  or recipient and representativ e the\\nopportunity  to submit a written request to the ALJ, no later than 30\\ndays after receipt of the acknowledg ment letter, explaining  why it is\\nnecessary  that an OIG witness appear at the hearing ; and request the\\nbeneficiary  or recipient and representative submit evidence that is\\nnew, material, and related to the period on or before the date of the\\noriginal allowance. This evidence may include evidence the\\nbenefic iary or recipient obtained from the Receivers previously\\nassociated with his or her file in Eric C. Conn’s office.\\n   •To provid e notice of the hearing, the ALJ will send the beneficiary  or\\nrecipient the notice in Attachment 2 to the AR. If the ALJ determines\\ntestimony  from an OIG witness is necessary , the Notice of Hearing\\nwill inform the beneficiary  or recipient and representativ e of the\\nidentity  of any OIG witness who OIG intends to have appear at the\\nhearing . The Notice of Hearing will also inform the beneficiary  or\\nrecipient of the right to request that the ALJ issue a subpoena for any\\nother witnesses or documents pursuant to HAL LEX I-2-5-78 . Prior to\\nthe hearing , the SRC will also send the beneficiary  or recipient and\\nrepresentative, if any, an Exhibit Letter (Attachment 3) proposi ng the\\nexhibits at issue for the hearing . \\n07/31/2024\\n247\\nPART II - SSA  CHARTS,\\nMEMOR ANDA & MOR E!\\n1.

Did the ALJ adequately consider the claimant's cognitive impairments, including difficulties with comprehension, concentration, and word-finding, in accordance with SSR 14-1p when evaluating the impact of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) on the claimant's ability to work?\\n\\n2. Did the ALJ fail to assess the cumulative effects of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and other impairments on their residual functional capacity (RFC) as required by SSR 14-1p, and how did this oversight affect the determination of the claimant's ability to perform substantial gainful activity?\\n\\n3. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n4. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the claimant's treatment history and the effectiveness of prescribed therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n5. Did the ALJ violate HALLEX I-2-5-44 by failing to obtain a medical expert's opinion regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their ability to work?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ improperly dismiss the claimant's reports of cognitive difficulties associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, contrary to the guidance provided in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ fail to consider the potential side effects of medications prescribed for chronic fatigue syndrome and their impact on the claimant's ability to maintain attention and concentration, as discussed in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ err in not addressing the claimant's need for workplace accommodations due to chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's daily activities and how chronic fatigue syndrome limits those activities, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p, and how did this affect the overall assessment?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ fail to consider the opinions of treating physicians regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their functional capacity?\\n\\n11. Did the ALJ err in not considering the impact of the claimant's diabetes mellitus on their ability to work, as required by SSR 14-2p, and how did this oversight affect the evaluation?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ adequately assess the interaction between the claimant's obesity and diabetes mellitus, as required by SSR 14-2p and SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ comply with SSR 14-2p in addressing whether the claimant's diabetes mellitus equals a listed impairment, and did the failure to do so warrant remand for further consideration?\\n\\n14. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, considering the overlap of symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome?\\n\\n15. Did the ALJ fail to consider the longitudinal record in evaluating the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia, as SSR 12-2p recognizes that symptoms can wax and wane, and was this a significant error?\\n\\n16. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's headaches in accordance with SSR 19-4p, particularly regarding the severity and impact on daily functioning?\\n\\n17. Did the ALJ ignore the claimant's interstitial cystitis and its potential impact on functional limitations, as outlined in SSR 15-1p, and how did this oversight affect the overall assessment of the claimant's impairments?\\n\\n18. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the claimant's mental impairments and associated functional limitations as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a, and did the ALJ's failure to do so affect the decision?\\n\\n19.

Did the ALJ adequately consider the claimant's cognitive impairments, including difficulties with comprehension, concentration, and word-finding, in accordance with SSR 14-1p when evaluating the impact of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) on the claimant's ability to work?\\n\\n2. Did the ALJ fail to assess the cumulative effects of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and other impairments on their residual functional capacity (RFC) as required by SSR 14-1p, and how did this oversight affect the determination of the claimant's ability to perform substantial gainful activity?\\n\\n3. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the claimant's subjective complaints of fatigue and its impact on daily functioning, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n4. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the claimant's treatment history and the effectiveness of prescribed therapies for chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n5. Did the ALJ violate HALLEX I-2-5-44 by failing to obtain a medical expert's opinion regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their ability to work?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ improperly dismiss the claimant's reports of cognitive difficulties associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, contrary to the guidance provided in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ fail to consider the potential side effects of medications prescribed for chronic fatigue syndrome and their impact on the claimant's ability to maintain attention and concentration, as discussed in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ err in not addressing the claimant's need for workplace accommodations due to chronic fatigue syndrome, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's daily activities and how chronic fatigue syndrome limits those activities, contrary to the requirements of SSR 14-1p, and how did this affect the overall assessment?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ fail to consider the opinions of treating physicians regarding the severity of the claimant's chronic fatigue syndrome and its impact on their functional capacity?\\n\\n11. Did the ALJ err in not considering the impact of the claimant's diabetes mellitus on their ability to work, as required by SSR 14-2p, and how did this oversight affect the evaluation?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ adequately assess the interaction between the claimant's obesity and diabetes mellitus, as required by SSR 14-2p and SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ comply with SSR 14-2p in addressing whether the claimant's diabetes mellitus equals a listed impairment, and did the failure to do so warrant remand for further consideration?\\n\\n14. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, considering the overlap of symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome?\\n\\n15. Did the ALJ fail to consider the longitudinal record in evaluating the severity of the claimant's fibromyalgia, as SSR 12-2p recognizes that symptoms can wax and wane, and was this a significant error?\\n\\n16. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's headaches in accordance with SSR 19-4p, particularly regarding the severity and impact on daily functioning?\\n\\n17. Did the ALJ ignore the claimant's interstitial cystitis and its potential impact on functional limitations, as outlined in SSR 15-1p, and how did this oversight affect the overall assessment of the claimant's impairments?\\n\\n18. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the claimant's mental impairments and associated functional limitations as required by 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a, and did the ALJ's failure to do so affect the decision?\\n\\n19. Did the ALJ adequately consider the impact of the claimant's obesity on their overall functional capacity, as required by SSR 19-2p, and how did this affect the determination of disability?\\n\\n20. Did the ALJ fulfill their duty to develop the record fully, including obtaining necessary medical evidence and considering post-hearing submissions, as required by HALLEX and relevant regulations, and how did any failures in this regard impact the decision?\\n\\nThis refined set of questions maintains clarity and specificity while addressing the potential errors made by the ALJ in evaluating the claimant's various impairments, ensuring compliance with relevant legal standards and HALLEX guidelines.\"\n",

      "  \"context\": \"other opini on evidenc e, the extent to which an adjud icator can rely on the\\nGAF rating as a mea sure of impairmen t severity and ment al functioning\\ndepe nds on whether the GAF rating is consistent with other evidenc e, how\\nfamiliar the rater is with the claimant , and the rater’s expertise.\\nB. Backgr ound\\nThe Diagno stic and Statistical Manua l of Ment al Diso rders (DSM),\\npubli shed perio dically by  the Americ an Psychiatric Association (APA ),\\nprovides the common langu age and standa rd criteria for classification of\\nment al disorde rs. The DSM, Fourt h Edition, Text Revision  (DSM-I V-TR )\\nprovided for a multi-axial assessment  of ment al disorde rs. Axis I covered\\nclinical disorde rs; Axis II covered  personali ty dis orde rs and ment al\\nretarda tion; Axis III covered  gener al medic al conditions; Axis IV considere d\\npsychosocial and environment al prob lems ; and Axis V, also known as the\\nGAF,  reported the clinician’s  judgmen t of a person’s overall level of\\nfunctioning.  \\n284\\nNOTE:  Rec ently the APA  publis hed a fifth edition (DSM-5 ) that does not\\ninclude GAF rating for assessment of ment al disorde rs. How ever, we will\\ncontinue to receive and consider GAF in medic al evidenc e. \\nC. What is the GAF?\\nThe GAF is a rating repo rting the clinician’s  judgmen t of a person’s ability\\nto function in daily lif e. See DSM-I V-TR , p. 32. It reflects the clinician’s\\nsubjective jud gment  about  the pers on’s sympto m severity and\\npsychologi cal, social, and occupational  functioning.  The  rating does  not\\nreflect impair ment  in function caused by physical or environme ntal\\nlimitations. \\nEach 10-p oint range within the GAF has two compone nts: one that covers\\nsymptom severity, and a second covering  functioning.  If a pers on’s\\nsymptom severity and level of functioning differ, the GAF rating reflects the\\nlower rat ing. In other words , a pers on with a number  of psychologi cal\\nsymptoms  and very few fu nctional limitations would get a GAF s core\\nconsistent with his or her repo rted psychologi cal sympto ms (DSM-I V-TR , p.\\n33).\\nD. Problem s with using the GAF to evaluate disability  \\nThe prob lem with using the GAF to evaluat e disability is that there  is no\\nway to standa rdize meas ureme nt and evaluat ion. Res earc hers  have\\npoint ed out numero us proble ms with the GAF - from the choice of rating\\nscale, to the choice of anchor point s, to the limited instructions to clinicians\\nfor rating GAFs  within  the 10-p oint intervals. Some researc hers  sugge sted\\nthat aband oning  the GAF altoget her in favor of a 5-poin t scale, might mak e\\nratings mor e accurate.\\nOther researc hers  had ques tions about  the anchor point s of the scale,\\nbecause it is unclear whether other key words  or examples  would result in\\na better GAF. The anchor point s are indic ators that help the clinician\\nestablish the GAF rating. The  current anchor point s are gene rally inc lusion\\ncriteria. For example,  “occasional ly failing to maintain pers onal hygiene ” is\\na criterion that could result in a GAF rating of 20-11 . Some researc hers\\nbelie ve addin g exclusion criteria to the anchors  might promot e better inter-\\nrater reliability. An exclusion criterion might  be “do not rate GAF lower than\\n285\\n20 if the individual is clean but somewhat disheveled”.  \\nAs another example,  some researc hers  have expres sed concern that, as\\nmanag ed-c are companie s continue to set practice standa rds and quali ty\\nguide lines , and the trend towards  account ability for  clinical outcomes\\ncontinues  to grow, p ractitioner s may be unde r increas ing pres sure to use\\nGAF ratings and DSM d iagno ses in inapp ropriate ways to ensure\\ninsuran ce coverag e for treatment .\\nResearc h has also ident ified the prop ensity of  some clinicians to give\\ninflated or unre alistically low  GAF ratings because the GAF rating\\ninstructions in the DSM-I V-TR a re unclear.  In gene ral, inter-rater reliab ility\\nratings are low in the clinical setting because there is great variabilit y of\\ntraining  and experie nce levels amongs t clinicians. Thes e rating prob lems ,\\nalone  or in combinat ion, can lead to imprope r assessment of impair ment\\nseverity.\\n1. GAF ratings ar e not st andardi zed \\nThe GAF is neither standa rdized nor based on norma tive dat a. A GAF\\nrating compare s the patient with the distinctive popu lation of patients the\\nclinician has known. Th is limits direct compara bility of GAF scores\\nassigned  by differen t evaluat ors or even by the same e valuat or at\\nsubstantially dif ferent points in time.\\nAlthoug h the GAF rating is numeric al, the actual numbe r assigned  can be\\nmisleadi ng because the score does  not quant ify dif ferenc es in function\\nbetween peop le. For example,  a GAF s core of 75 does  not mea n a pers on\\nis functioning 10 units better than a pers on with a score of 65, nor does  a\\nGAF of 40 indic ate a pers on is functioning half as well as a person with a\\nscore of 80.\\nGAF ratings assigned  by differen t clinicians are inconsistent because of\\nthe lack of standar dization. In a clinical (i.e., treatment  and evaluat ion)\\nsetting, inter-rater reliab ility is gener ally low  because of variabilit y of\\ntraining  and experie nce levels among clinicians. This mea ns adjudi cators\\ncannot  draw relia ble inferen ces from differen ces in GAF ratings assigned\\nby differen t clinicians or from a single GAF score in isolation\\n286\\n2. GAF is not desi gned to predi ct outcome\\nClinic ians use the GAF to help plan and meas ure the impac t of treatment\\n(see DSM-I V-TR , p. 32). It is of limited value for assessing prog nosis or\\ntreatment  outcome a nd other meas ures  are better indicators of outcome.\\nFor example,  research sugges ts the highe st level of functioning for a\\nperio d of time is a better predic tor of prog nosis than the lowest  level of\\nfunctioning for a time perio d. \\n3. GAF ratings need supporti ng detai l \\nThe GAF scale anchors  are very gener al and there can be a significant\\nvariat ion in how cl inicians rate a GAF. For example,  if a claiman t has a\\nGAF of 20, it could mean that he or she is not maintainin g minimal\\npers onal hygiene  (a clinical observation),  or that the claimant  has some\\npotential to hurt himself or others (a clinical judgme nt). Interpreting the\\nGAF rating requ ires knowing what the clinician was focusing on when\\nassigning  the overall rating. Although  the DSM-I V-TR r ecommends\\nassigning  a rating reflecting the lower as sessment  when s ympto m severity\\nand level of functioning differ, evaluat ors rarely not e whether the score\\nreflects function, sympto ms, or both. \\nE. Weighing GA F ratings as  opinion e vidence\\nFor purp oses of the Social Security disability prog rams , when it comes\\nfrom an  acceptable medic al source, a GAF rating is a med ical opini on as\\ndefined in 20 CFR §§ 404. 1527 (a)(2) and 416. 927(a)(2). An adjud icator\\nconsiders  a GAF s core with all of the relevant evidenc e in the case file and\\nweighs  a GAF rating as require d by §§ 20 CFR 404. 1527 (c), 416. 927(c),\\nand SSR 06-0 3p, while keeping  the following in  mind: \\nThe GAF is unlike most other opini on evidenc e we evaluat e because it is a\\nrating. Howev er, as with other opini on evidenc e, a GAF n eeds  suppo rting\\nevidenc e to be given much weight . By itself, the GAF cannot  be used to\\n“rais e” or “lower” s omeon e’s level of function. The  GAF is only a s naps hot\\nopini on abou t the level of functioning.  It is one opini on that we c onsider\\nwith all the evidenc e abou t a pers on’s functioning.  Unless the clinician\\n287\\nclearly ex plain s the reasons behind  his or her GAF rating, and the perio d to\\nwhich the rating appli es, it does  not provide a reliable longi tudinal  picture of\\nthe claimant ’s men tal functioning for a disability analysis . \\nA GAF score is never dispositive of impairmen t severity. DO NOT:\\nGive c ontrolling weight  to a GAF from a treating source unles s it is well\\nsupported and not inconsistent with the other evidenc e.\\nWhen case evidenc e includes  a GAF from a treating source and you do\\nnot give it controlling weight , you must provide g ood reasons in the\\npersonali zed disability ex plana tion or decision notice. \\nEqua te any particular GAF score with a listing-level limitation. \\nYou c anno t use a GAF rating to determine  whethe r a claiman t’s\\nimpair ment  mee ts the diagn ostic criteria of men tal retardation in listing\\n12.05, because the rating lacks specificity, may not  reflect a claiman t’s\\nfunctioning over time, and is not a standardized meas ure of anything,\\nincludin g intelligence and adap tive beh avior. \\nEqua te a particular GAF score with a particular ment al residual  functional\\ncapacity as sessment . \\nThe GAF does  not mea sure the ability to meet  the ment al deman ds of\\nunskilled work. There have been  no publi shed studies  of how, or  if, GAF\\nscores relate to mee ting the deman ds of unskilled work. Additionally, t here\\nis no correlation between GAF scores and the B criteria in the ment al\\ndisorders listings.\\nQuest ions  \\nDirec t all program–re lated and technical ques tions to your RO support staff\\nor PSC OA staff.

Purpose\\nThis emerg ency  messag e (EM) identifies certain Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT)\\noccupations that are isolated. “I solated” occupations are occupations with jobs that “exist only  in\\nvery limited numbers in relatively  few locations outside of the reg ion where [ the individual\\nlives] ”; 20 CF R 404.1566(b) and416.966(b). This EM also ex plains that adjudicators may  not\\ncite work in those occupations to support a “not disabled” determination or decision that uses the\\nmedical-vocational g uidelines (20 CF R Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix  2) as a framework for\\ndecision making .\\nIMPORTANT: This g uidance does not apply  to determinations or decisions that are based on an\\nindividual’s ability  to do past relevant work. According ly, adjudicators may  continue to rely  on\\nisolated jobs at step four of the disability  evaluation process.\\nB. Background\\nAt step five in the sequential evaluation process for adult disability  claims (and at the\\ncorresponding  step in the medical improvement review standard used in continuing  disability\\nreviews), we must determine whether, considering  their residual functional capacity  (RFC), ag e,\\neducation, and work ex perience, an individual can adjust to other work that ex ists in sig nificant\\nnumbers in the national economy . In determinations and decisions in which the medical-\\nvocational g uidelines do not direct an outcome under our rules, we use the medical-vocational\\nguidelines as a framework for decision making . When we use the medical-vocational g uidelines\\nas a framework and make a finding  of “not disabled,” we must support the finding  with evidence\\n1\\n292\\nthat an individual can adjust to work that ex ists in sig nificant numbers in the national economy .\\nUnder our rules, isolated jobs are jobs that “ex ist only  in very  limited numbers in relatively  few\\nlocations outside of the reg ion where [ the individual lives] .” 20 CF R 404.1566 and 416.966.\\nOccupations with isolated jobs are therefore not considered “work which ex ists in the national\\neconomy .”\\nIn the medical-vocational g uidelines and our other rules, we take administrative notice of the\\nDOT and its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the\\nRevised Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (SCO), as reliable sources of information. W hile\\nthese publications provide information about the requirements of work, they  do not provide\\ninformation about how much work ex ists within occupations or where such work ex ists within\\nthe national economy .\\nIn developing  this g uidance, we used current federal employ ment data from the B ureau of L abor\\nStatistics’ Occupational Employ ment and W age Statistics (OEW S) prog ram for the y ears 2020\\nto 2022. The OEWS prog ram publishes data using  the Standard Occupational Classification\\n(SOC) sy stem. F irst, we summed the OEW S state level employ ment data for each y ear by  U.S.\\nCensus Division. The Census Divisions divide the states into nine g eographical areas, as is\\nexplained here. Then, we identified the SOC occupations with fewer than 1,000 employ ees in\\neach of the nine U.S. Census Divisions in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 OEW S panels. There are 35\\nSOC occupations that meet these criteria. W e then identified the corresponding  DOT\\noccupations, using  the Occupational I nformation Network (O*NET) DOT crosswalk file\\n(available here). Using  this method, we identified 114 DOT occupations, each of which\\ncorresponds to one of the 35 SOC occupations with jobs that ex ist in very  limited numbers in\\neach U.S. Census Division. W e will now consider these 114 DOT occupations isolated in all\\nregions of the country .\\nC. P olicy\\nUnder 20 CF R 404.1566 and 416.966, when we make a determination or decision at step five of\\nthe sequential evaluation, we will not deny  disability  benefits based on the ex istence of isolated\\njobs which ex ist only  in very  limited numbers in relatively  few locations outside of the reg ion\\nwhere the individual lives. W e have determined that the DOT occupations listed below currently\\nsatisfy  the reg ulatory  definition of isolated jobs in all reg ions of the country .\\nOur adjudicators may  not support a “not disabled” determination or decision under the\\nframework of the medical-vocational g uidelines by  citing  any of the following  occupations as\\nexamples of other work an individual can perform. W e will remove an occupation from this list\\nif we later determine that occupational data demonstrate that it is no long er isolated.\\n2\\n293\\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry Designation(s)\\n013.061- 010 AGRI CULTURAL  ENGI NEER professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 014 AGRI CULTURAL -RESEARCH ENGI NEER professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 018DESI GN-ENGI NEER, AGRI CULTURAL\\nEQUI PMENT professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 022TEST ENGI NEER, AGRI CULTURAL\\nEQUI PMENT professional and kindred occupations\\n021.067- 010 ASTRONOMER professional and kindred occupations\\n029.067- 010 GEOGRAPHER professional and kindred occupations\\n029.067- 014 GEOGRAPHER, PHYSI CAL professional and kindred occupations\\n045.061- 014 PSYCHOL OGIST, ENGI NEERI NG professional and kindred occupations\\n045.107- 030PSYCHOL OGIST, INDUSTRI AL-\\nORGANI ZATIONAL professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 014 DIRECTOR, STATE- HISTORI CAL SOCI ETY professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 018 GENEAL OGIST professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 022 HISTORI AN professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 026 HISTORI AN, DRAMATI C ARTS professional and kindred occupations\\n052.167- 010 DIRECTOR, RESEARCHmotion picture;

Purpose\\nThis emerg ency messag e (EM) clarifies and consolidates guidance related to evidentiary  support for\\ncertain “not disabled” determinations and decisions that use the medical-vocational guidelines (20\\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix  2) as a framework for decision making . It explains heightened\\nevidentiary  and articulation requirements about certain Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT)\\noccupations whose continued widespread ex istence multiple courts have questioned.\\nB. Background\\nAt step five in the sequential evaluation process for adult disability  claims (and at the corresponding\\nstep in the medical improvement review  standard used in continuing  disability  reviews), we must\\ndetermine whether an individual can adjust to other work, given their residual functional capacity\\n(RFC) along  with their age, education, and work experience. In determinations and decisions in\\nwhich the medical-vocational guidelines do not direct an outcome under our rules, we use the\\nmedical-vocational guidelines as a framework for decision making . When we use the medical-\\nvocational guidelin es as a framework and make a finding  of “not disabled,” we must support the\\nfinding  with evidence that an individual can adjust to work that exists in significant numbers in the\\nnational economy .\\nIn the medical-vocational guidelines and our other rules, we take administrative notice of the DOT\\nand its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised\\nDictionary  of Occupational Titles (SCO), as reliable sources of information. Social Security  Ruling\\n(SSR) 00-4p  explains that, when there is an apparent conflict between vocational expert (VE) or\\nvocational specialist (VS) evidence and information in the DOT, the adjudicator must elicit a\\nreasonable explanation for the conflict and explain in the determination or decision how the conflict\\nis resolved. For example, descriptions of occupations in the DOT may refer to job materials or\\nprocesses that have been replaced by more modern materials or processes identified by a VS or VE.\\n1\\n299\\nThis may  create a conflict that an adjudicator must address under SSR 00-4p .\\nSome courts have questioned whether some occupations continue to be performed in the manner that\\nthey are described in the DOT. To ensure that our decisions are adequately  supported and consistent\\nwith SSR 00-4p , we are clarify ing the evidence needed to resolve these potential conflicts and\\nsupport a finding  of “not disabled” with respect to the listed occupations discussed below.\\nC. Policy\\nAn adjudicator may not cite any of the DOT occupations listed below to support a framework “not\\ndisabled” determination or decision without additional evidence from a VS or VE supporting  the\\nadjudicator’s conclusion that, as the occupation is currently  performed:\\n•Its requirements are consistent with the individual’s RF C, and\\n•It exists in the national economy  in numbers that alone, or in combination with work in\\nother cited occupations, are sig nificant.\\nThe determination or decision must includ e or summariz e the VS or VE’s evidence that supports\\nsuch a conclusion. This requirement applies if the adjudicator intends to rely on any of the following\\noccupations as support for a framework finding  of “not disabled”:\\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry Designation\\n209.587- 010 Addr esser clerical\\n249.587- 018 Docum ent Preparer, Microfilming business ser vices\\n249.587- 014 Cutter-and-Paster, Press Cl ippings business ser vices\\n239.687- 014 Tube Oper ator clerical\\n318.687- 018 Silver Wrapper hotel and r estaurant\\n349.667- 010 Host /Host ess, Dance Hal l amusem ent and r ecreation\\n349.667- 014 Host /Host ess, Head amusem ent and r ecreation\\n379.367- 010 Surveillance- System Monitor government services\\n521.687- 010 Almond Bl ancher , Hand canni ng and pr eserving\\n521-687-086 Nut Sorter canni ng and pr eserving\\n726.685- 010 Magnetic-Tape W inder recording\\n782.687- 030 Puller-Through glove and m itten\\n976.385- 010 Microfilm Processor business ser vices\\nNOTE : Alternatively , adjudicators may support the determination or decision with other\\noccupation(s) appropriate to the facts of the claim.

Background\\n1. New regulatory def inition of  PRW ef fective June 22, 2024\\nOn June 22, 2024, we implemented final reg ulations 89 F R 27653  Intermediate Improvement\\nto the Disability Adjudication Process Including How W e Consider Past W ork (PRW  Rule).\\nThe PRW  rule provides a new and less restrictive definition of PRW , see 20\\nCFR 404.1560(b)(1) , and Social Security  Ruling  (SSR) 24-2p .\\nThe new PRW  definition is less restrictive than the prior PRW definition in two way s:\\n•The relevant period considers 5 y ears rather than 15 y ears of past work, and\\n• Work that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2. Res Judicata\\nOur administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided it does not need\\nto be decided ag ain. W e apply  res judicata at all levels of the adjudication process to avoid\\ndeciding  an issue that we have previously  decided based on the same facts, same issues, same\\nparties, and same adjudicative period ( DI 27516.001).\\nRes judicata is applicable only  with respect to the period covered by  the prior final\\n1\\n303\\ndetermination or decision. The end of this date period will g enerally  correspond to the date of\\nthe prior final determination or decision, ex cept when the date the claimant last met the non-\\ndisability  requirements for entitlement ex pired prior to the date of the final determination or decision.\\nFor additional information about using  administrative res judicata for disability  claims,\\nsee DI 27516.000 and GN 03101.160 .\\nC. Policy\\nWe will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously  adjudicated period when\\nthe prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not disabled is dated prior to\\nJune 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found the individual could do:\\n1.PRW at step fo ur of the sequential evaluation process (SEP) and the PRW  cited is not\\nPRW  under the PRW  rule; OR\\n2.Other w ork at step f ive of the SEP, work ex perience was material to the decision, and\\nthe individual’s work ex perience is different under the PRW  rule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, we will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or dismiss\\na request for hearing  on that claim.\\nD. Procedures\\n1. Field Of fice (F O) Instructions\\nDo not apply  res judicata if a subsequent Title I I claim is pending  on or filed after J une 22,\\n2024, and we previously  made an administratively  final determination or decision deny ing\\ndisability  throug h the last day  the claim met the non-disability  requirements, and the\\nregulation basis code (RB C) for the prior denial is:\\na.

Alert the DDS to potential res judicata\\ndeterminations and add the following  messag e to the certified electronic folder (CEF ):\\n“DDS jurisdiction: potential denial on basis of res judicata. DDS review necessary .”\\nNOTE: In addition, do not apply  res judicata if any  of the additional requirements in DI\\n27516.001B  are not met or the ex ception in DI 27516.001E  (new and material evidence)\\napplies.\\n2. DDS Instructions\\na.Initial review of claims in which res judicata potentially  applies\\nThe DDS will assume jurisdiction to review cases identified by  the F O as potential res\\njudicata determinations, with the following  messag e to the certified electronic folder (CEF ):\\n“DDS jurisdiction: potential denial on basis of res judicata. DDS review necessary .”\\nIf any  of the requirements in DI 27516.001B  are not met, make a substantive\\ndetermination on the claim as ex plained in DI 27516.005D . Res judicata does not apply .\\nIf one of the RB Cs from sections D.1.a. or D.1.b. in this EM applies and the prior\\ndetermination or decision was before J une 22, 2024, review the claim to determine if res\\njudicata applies.

A new substantive determination is\\nrequired if:\\n1.The new definition of PRW produces a chang e in work ex perience categ ory that could \\n    be material to the determination in the subsequent claim.\\nRes Judicata does not apply--\\nIF the prior\\ndeterm ination or\\ndecision f ound the\\nindividual’s w ork\\nexperience w as:AND the prior\\nclaim  was denied\\nusing (directed or\\nas a f ramework)\\nrule:AND the claim ant’s w ork experience category\\nunder current rules is:\\nSkilled or\\nsemiskilled, skills\\ntransferable201.03\\n201.07\\n201.11\\n201.15\\n202.03\\n202.07Skilled or semiskilled, skills not transferable OR\\nUnskilled OR\\nNone\\nUnskilled 203.03\\n203.11None\\n2.In the prior claim the claimant had limited education, was ag e 55 or older and had     \\nwork ex perience, but for the new claim, considering  the current definition of PRW ,\\nthey have no PRW .\\nNOTE:  Because the claimant has no PRW  under current rules, they  would meet the “no\\nwork” profile. See SSR 24-1p .\\nIF the criteria in D.2.c.1 and D.2.c.2 in this EM do not apply , THEN  the new definition of\\nPRW  would not y ield an outcome different from the prior determination or decision, such\\nthat res judicata may  be a basis for denial of the subsequent claim, provided that the usual\\nrequirements for apply ing res judicata are satisfied.\\nSee DI 27516.005D  for instructions on how to make a new determination if res judicata does\\nnot apply .\\n4\\n306\\n3.

F or all pending  initial, reconsideration,\\nhearing , and Appeals Council (AC) review cases where the appeal request was timely  filed or the\\ntime for filing  has been ex tended, and for cases remanded by  the courts, this means the ag ency\\nwill g enerally  apply  the revised criteria to the pending  claim as of the CoP date.\\nIn general, we may  reopen and revise a prior final determination or decision based on a CoP only\\nunder the one-y ear rule (DI  27505.020B .1) and, in the disability  contex t, only  if the result is\\nfavorable to the claimant. F or more information about reopening  and revising  a determination or\\ndecision, see DI  27501.005. See also 20 CF R 404.988(a), 416.1488(a), and Hearing s, Appeals,\\nand L itigation L aw (HAL LEX) manual I -2-9 and I -3-9.\\nThis CoP, effective 7/13/2024, ex pands our use of administrative collateral estoppel to adopt a\\nprior favorable disability  determination or decision in a subsequent claim for a different disability\\n1\\n309\\nbenefit or Supplemental Security  Income (SSI ) pay ments. I n certain cases, we will not decide the\\nissue of disability  again if, based on our prior final determination or decis ion, we have already\\ndecided that the individual is disabled for the period in question, and we have not determined that\\ntheir disability  ceased. The new policy  will apply  not only  to subsequent claims and appeals filed\\non or after the CoP effective date, but also to claims pending  at all administrative adjudication\\nlevels as of the CoP effective date as well as certain previously  adjudicated claims in which (1)\\nwe or the claimant questioned the final determination or decision in writing  within one y ear of\\nthe date of the notice of the initial determination, and (2) the questioning  occurred after, or was\\nnot resolved as of the CoP effective date (see DI  27505.020).\\nC. Collateral Estoppel P olicy CoP\\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of disability  in a subsequent\\nclaim by  the same individual for a different disability  benefit or SSI  payments if, in our prior\\nfinal determination or decision, we have already  decided that the individual is disabled for the\\nperiod in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1. Both the prior determination or decision and new claim require application of the same\\nstatutory  definition of disability .\\n2. We have not made an intervening  medical determination or decision finding  that the\\nindividual’s disability  ceased.\\n3. The individual has not eng aged in substantial g ainful activity  since the prior established\\nonset date (EOD).\\n4.The EOD in the prior claim is on or before the date when the nonmedical requirements\\nfor entitlement are last met in the new claim.\\n5.The record with the prior favorable disability  determination or decision is not in\\nterminated status.\\n6.We do not have reason to believe that the prior disability  determination or decision was\\nwrong .\\nConsult DI  11011.001 for instructions on how to analy ze each of these criteria.\\nD. Claim  Identif ication\\nThis new policy  applies not only  to subsequent claims and appeals filed on or after the CoP\\neffective date, but also to claims we refer to as CoP claims.\\nFor collateral estoppel, we will proactively  identify  and process CoP claims. CoP claims are:\\n1. Initial claims and appeals pending  as of the CoP effective date.\\n2.Closed claims in which we or the claimant questioned the ag ency ’s prior final\\n2\\n310\\ndetermination or decision in writing  within one y ear of the date of the notice of the initial\\ndetermination.\\nQuestioning  the determination or decision in writing :\\n•The claimant files a subsequent claim for the same benefit alleg ing an onset date within\\nthe period adjudicated by  the prior determination or decision; or\\n•The claimant otherwise indicates in writing  that they  disag ree with the determination or\\ndecision.\\n•The Ag ency indicates in writing  that it is considering  reopening  and revising  the\\ndetermination or decision.\\nOne-Year Requirement: To meet the one-y ear requirement:\\n•A subsequent application, other written request for reopening  (express or implied), or\\nother written ex pression of disag reement with the prior determination or decision must be\\nmade within one y ear of the date of the notice of the initial determination; and\\n•The questioning  must either occur after or be pending  a response from us as of the CoP\\neffective date.\\nSee DI 27505.020 for more information on the one-y ear requirement.\\nNote on I mplied Requests to Reopen: A subsequent claim for a previously  denied benefit is\\nconsidered an implied request to reopen the prior determination or decision when the claimant\\nalleg es an onset date of disability  within the previously  adjudicated period. I n such cases, the\\nsubsequent claim satisfies the second CoP claim criterion if filed within one y ear of the date of\\nthe notice of the initial determination associated with the prior final determination or decision.\\nExample of an I mplied Request to Reopen: An SSI  recipient filed a disability  insurance benefit\\n(DIB) claim with an AOD of Aug ust 1, 2022. The claim was denied in an initial determination\\nwith a notice date of October 1, 2023. The SSI  recipient did not appeal the determination, which\\ntherefore became the final determination of the ag ency on that DI B claim.\\nThe claimant files a new DI B claim on Aug ust 27, 2024, with an AOD of November 15, 2022.\\nThis AOD falls within the period adjudicated in the final determination on the prior DI B claim:\\nAugust 1, 2022, throug h October 1, 2023. Therefore, this DI B claim is an implied request to\\nreopen the final determination on the prior DI B claim.\\nIn this ex ample, the subsequent claim was filed after the CoP effective date and within one y ear\\nof the date of the notice of the initial determination. Therefore, the implied request to reopen\\nmeets the one-y ear requirement. According ly, if the criteria in section C of this EM are met, we\\nwill reopen the final determination on the prior DI B claim and apply  collateral estoppel based on\\nthe individual’s ong oing eligibility  for SSI . We will apply  payment retroactivity  based on the\\nfiling  date of the orig inal DI B claim.\\nIMPORTANT: I n general in the disability  contex t, and for purposes of this CoP, we may  reopen\\n3\\n311\\nunder the one-y ear rule, based on the CoP, only  where revision would be favorable to the\\nclaimant (see DI  27505.020B .1).\\nE. Field of fice (F O) procedures f or CoP  claim s\\n1.Initial or reconsideration claim pending  at the F O\\nIf an initial claim or reconsideration appeal is pending  at the F O on or after the CoP effective\\ndate and collateral estoppel may  apply , the F O will ensure that all the criteria in section C of\\nthis EM are met.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies to the entire period in question, the F O will adjudicate the\\nclaim following  DI 11011.001E. I f the claim is pending  in EDCS, close the EDCS claim\\nas an F O Determination and select “Disability  established/pending  same issue” as the\\nreason.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies but an alleg ed onset date (AOD) earlier than the prior\\ndetermination EOD could provide for additional entitlement, the F O will determine the\\npotential onset date (POD) on the subsequent claim and, if the POD predates the prior\\ndetermination or decision EOD, follow the instructions in DI  11011.001F  and transfer the\\nclaim to the DDS.\\n•If collateral estoppel does not apply , the F O will not add the collateral estoppel flag  and\\nwill handle the claim under its normal procedures.\\n2. Pending  initial or reconsideration claim returned from the Disability  Determination Services\\n(DDS)\\nThe F O will review claims returned from the DDS to determine whether all the criteria in\\nsection C of this EM are met.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies to the entire period in question, the F O will adjudicate the\\nclaim following  DI 11011.001 and close the EDCS claim as an F O Determination and\\nselect “Disability  established/pending  same issue” as the reason.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies but an AOD earlier than the prior determination EOD could\\nprovide for additional entitlement, the F O will determine the POD on the subsequent\\nclaim and transfer the claim back to the DDS following  the instructions in DI\\n11011.001F .\\nIf collateral estoppel does not apply , the F O will:\\n•Remove the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag;\\nUpdate the POD;\\n•Add a Report of Contact (RoC) stating  “Collateral estoppel flag  removed, disability\\ndetermination needed” and providing  the reason why  collateral estoppel does not apply ;\\n4\\n312\\n\\\"Example RoC lang uage: “Collateral estoppel flag  removed; disability  determination\\nneeded.  Collateral estoppel does not apply  because the record with the prior favorable\\ndisability  determination or decision is in terminated status.”\\n•Add the following  subject line to the RoC: “Disability  Determination Needed”; and\\n•Transfer the claim back to the DDS.\\n3. Claims in which a prior final determination or decision is questioned in writing  within one\\nyear of the date of the notice of the initial determination (hereinafter, “one-y ear claims”)\\nIf the section C criteria are met, the F O will determine which component made the final\\ndetermination or decision on the prior claim.\\n• If the prior claim was finally  adjudicated at the F O or DDS level, the F O will reopen and\\nrevise the prior determination following  the procedures set out in this EM for pending\\ninitial or reconsideration claims.\\n•If the prior claim was finally  decided at the Hearing  or Appeals Council level, the F O will\\nadd the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  to the file and alert the\\ncomponent that made the prior final decision.\\nFO Reopening  Authority : For collateral estoppel CoP, the F O has the authority  to reopen\\ndeterminations made below the hearing  level when collateral estoppel applies. See DI\\n27501.005B .3.d.\\nPayment Retroactivity : For determinations made at the F O or DDS level that can be reopened\\nand revised under the one-y ear CoP requirement and where all the criteria are met to apply\\ncollateral estoppel, the F O will apply  payment retroactivity  based on the filing  date of the\\nclaim with the reopened determination.\\n4.Claims in which a prior final determination or decision is questioned in writing  more than\\none y ear from the date of the notice of the initial determination\\nWe may  apply  collateral estoppel in a subsequent claim even when we cannot reopen the\\nprior determination under CoP policy  because the date of the notice of the initial\\ndetermination is more than one y ear before the protective filing  date of the subsequent\\napplication.\\nProcedure and Pay ment Retroactivity : Do not reopen the prior determination but, if all the\\ncriteria in C of this EM are met, process the subsequent claim as a collateral estoppel\\ndetermination and use its filing  date — rather than the filing  date of the claim associated with\\nthe prior final determination — to determine appropriate retroactive entitlement.\\nOnset of Disability  Within a Previously  Adjudicated Period: W hen we cannot reopen a prior\\ndetermination or decision but the disability  criteria have since chang ed and provide a basis\\nfor establishing  disability  on a new Title I I application, onset of disability  on the subsequent\\nclaim may  be established within the period adjudicated in the prior determination or decision,\\nif supported by  all evidence (see DI  25501.250A.5 and DI  27505.020B .3).\\n5313\\nF. DDS P rocedures f or CoP  Claim s Pending at the Initial and Reconsideration Levels\\n1. Batch transfer of pending  claims\\nFrom J uly 20, 2024, throug h July 21, 2024, the Office of Disability  Information Sy stems\\n(ODI S) will initiate an automatic transfer (No Determination) of pending  electronic claims\\nfrom the DDS to the F O. Claims transferred will consist of all initial claims and\\nreconsideration appeals with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  where the\\nclaimant is in current or suspended pay ment status on another title or benefit ty pe. Claims\\nflagged as potential collateral estoppel and where the individual is not in current or\\nsuspended pay ment status will remain in the DDS’ jurisdiction.\\nFO technicians will be able to identify  the batch transfer claims via:\\n•The “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag ;\\n•The ND date of J uly 20, 2024, or J uly 21, 2024; and\\n•The \\\" FO Determination Requested” ND reason in the W orkload Action Center.\\nThe DDS will be responsible for reviewing  the remaining  claims to determine if the claim is\\nincorrectly  flagged or if it should be manually  transferred to the F O for a collateral estoppel\\ndetermination. I f the claim is incorrectly  flagged, remove the flag , and continue development\\nfollowing  usual procedures.\\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT manually  transfer any  collateral estoppel claims to the F O until after\\nthe automatic transfer is complete.\\n2. Claims ex cluded from batch transfer - unsuccessful closures\\nClosure will occur automatically  for most claims included in the automatic transfer of\\npending  electronic claims from the DDS to the F O, but certain claims may  fail to close\\nautomatically  (e.g., outstanding  items remain, such as a scheduled CE). W hen a claim fails to\\nclose automatically , it may  not be automatically  transferred to the F O. ODI S will send each\\nDDS a list of unsuccessful transfers.\\nEach DDS shall resolve unsuccessful transfers within their jurisdiction by :\\n•Resolving  any outstanding  items that are preventing  closure;\\n•Adding  the following  messag e to eView:\\nClaim returned to F O due to 7/13/2024 Collateral Estoppel Chang e of Position;\\n•Making  a “No Determination” (ND) determination with the reason “F O Determination\\nRequested” and include the Reason Detail “Collateral Estoppel Chang e of Position”; and\\n•Manually  transferring  the claim to the F O.\\n3. Unflag ged CoP claims\\nIf DDS finds a potential collateral estoppel CoP issue in a pending  claim that does not have\\nthe “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag, do not transfer it manually  to the F O\\nuntil after the automatic transfer has taken place. Once the automatic transfer has occurred,\\n6314\\nthe DDS will add the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  to the file and follow\\nthe steps in F .2 to ND and return the claim to the F O.\\n4. Office of Quality  Review (OQR) returns\\nEach claim with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  returned by  OQR to the\\nDDS will require review by  the DDS to determine if it must be manually  returned to the F O\\nfor a collateral estoppel determination.\\nThe DDS will follow the steps in F .2. to ND and return the claim to the F O.\\nG. Office of  Hearings Operations (OHO) P rocedures f or Pending CoP  claim s\\n1. Identification, Routing , and Administrative Processing\\nOHO reg ional offices (RO) will identify  pending  CoP claims which are identified with the\\n“Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  in eView. Each OHO RO will provide any\\npertinent hearing  office (HO) within their reg ion with a list of pending  CoP claims with the\\n“Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues” flag  in eView. HO manag ement or their desig nee will\\nadd the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues” (PCEI ) case characteristic to the claims in\\nOHO’s case processing  systems (HACPS and/or CPMS).\\nEach HO will be responsible for identify ing CoP paper claims pending  within the office and\\ndesig nating  them as such.\\n2. Evaluation Process\\nHO manag ement will assig n each claim to a Senior Attorney  Advisor or Decision W riter to\\nreview and provide a recommendation to the administrative law judg e (AL J) on whether the\\nclaim meets the criteria in section C of this EM, using  either the Case Notes section of\\nHACPS case processing  with a HACPS referral to the AL J, or the Remarks in CPMS with a\\nCPMS to-do to the AL J, as appropriate.\\nIf the AL J agrees that the claim meets the criteria in section C of this EM, the AL J will issue\\na decision adopting  the disability  finding  from the prior determination or decision.\\nIf the AL J decides that collateral estoppel does not apply , the AL J will proceed with\\nadjudicating  the claim. HO staff will add an eView messag e explaining  why  the collateral\\nestoppel criteria in section C of the EM are not met.\\n3. Effect of Evaluation on Hearing\\nIf collateral estoppel applies to the entire period at issue in the current appeal, the AL J will\\ndecide the claim on the record and not conduct an oral hearing  (See 20 CF R § 404.948 and\\n416.1448).\\nIf collateral estoppel applies only  to part of the period at issue in the current appeal, the AL J\\n7315\\nwill adopt the prior determination or decision only  for that portion of the period at issue and\\nthen proceed with adjudicating  the remainder of the claim.\\nExample: A subsequent Title I I claim features a POD that is earlier than the EOD for the\\nprior favorable determination or decision. Collateral estoppel cannot apply  to the period\\nbetween the current claim’s POD and the prior determination or decision’s EOD.\\n4. Processing  One-Year Claims\\nThe Office of the Chief Administrative L aw Judge will obtain a list of claims pending  at\\nOHO with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  in which an AL J issued the\\nprior final decision.\\nAn AL J will determine whether the prior decision may  be reopened due to the CoP, and if so,\\nwill issue a new decision apply ing the new collateral estoppel criteria.\\nH.

In addition, the non-specific restriction in pushing  and\\npulling  and the sit/stand option resemble the hypothetical RFC to which [the VE]\\ncould only  identify  one job at reduced numbers.  F urther evaluation is warranted.  \\n338\\nAdditionally , the Appeals Council noted that the ALJ evaluated the Title II claim based on the wrong\\ndate last insured and, thus, further evaluation of this claim was needed.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to the evidence of record supporting\\nthe assessed limitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.  The hypothetical\\nquestions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole\\nand before relying on VE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between\\nthe occupational evidence provided by  the VE and the DOT;  \\n \\n•assig n the case to another AL J as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n•determine if it is necessary  to associate the claim files from the subsequent claims for title\\nII and XVI  benefits and issue a decision on the associated claims; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any  further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record, and issue a new decision.\\nCaveat : The HALLEX cite to request assignment to a new ALJ on remand has changed to HALLEX\\nI-2-1-55( D)(6)\\n339\\n340\\n341\\n342\\n343\\n344\\n345\\n346\\n347\\n348\\n349\\n350\\n351\\nLetter Brief #2  \\nTopics Addres sed:\\n•Need for Review by  Medical Staff at AC\\n•Listing  3.02A, Pulmonary  Impairment\\n•Severity  - Mental I mpairment\\n•Past W ork - 15 Year Rule\\n•New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.

Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: other opini on evidenc e, the extent to which an adjud icator can rely on the\\nGAF rating as a mea sure of impairmen t severity and ment al functioning\\ndepe nds on whether the GAF rating is consistent with other evidenc e, how\\nfamiliar the rater is with the claimant , and the rater’s expertise.\\nB. Backgr ound\\nThe Diagno stic and Statistical Manua l of Ment al Diso rders (DSM),\\npubli shed perio dically by  the Americ an Psychiatric Association (APA ),\\nprovides the common langu age and standa rd criteria for classification of\\nment al disorde rs. The DSM, Fourt h Edition, Text Revision  (DSM-I V-TR )\\nprovided for a multi-axial assessment  of ment al disorde rs. Axis I covered\\nclinical disorde rs; Axis II covered  personali ty dis orde rs and ment al\\nretarda tion; Axis III covered  gener al medic al conditions; Axis IV considere d\\npsychosocial and environment al prob lems ; and Axis V, also known as the\\nGAF,  reported the clinician’s  judgmen t of a person’s overall level of\\nfunctioning.  \\n284\\nNOTE:  Rec ently the APA  publis hed a fifth edition (DSM-5 ) that does not\\ninclude GAF rating for assessment of ment al disorde rs. How ever, we will\\ncontinue to receive and consider GAF in medic al evidenc e. \\nC. What is the GAF?\\nThe GAF is a rating repo rting the clinician’s  judgmen t of a person’s ability\\nto function in daily lif e. See DSM-I V-TR , p. 32. It reflects the clinician’s\\nsubjective jud gment  about  the pers on’s sympto m severity and\\npsychologi cal, social, and occupational  functioning.  The  rating does  not\\nreflect impair ment  in function caused by physical or environme ntal\\nlimitations. \\nEach 10-p oint range within the GAF has two compone nts: one that covers\\nsymptom severity, and a second covering  functioning.  If a pers on’s\\nsymptom severity and level of functioning differ, the GAF rating reflects the\\nlower rat ing. In other words , a pers on with a number  of psychologi cal\\nsymptoms  and very few fu nctional limitations would get a GAF s core\\nconsistent with his or her repo rted psychologi cal sympto ms (DSM-I V-TR , p.\\n33).\\nD. Problem s with using the GAF to evaluate disability  \\nThe prob lem with using the GAF to evaluat e disability is that there  is no\\nway to standa rdize meas ureme nt and evaluat ion. Res earc hers  have\\npoint ed out numero us proble ms with the GAF - from the choice of rating\\nscale, to the choice of anchor point s, to the limited instructions to clinicians\\nfor rating GAFs  within  the 10-p oint intervals. Some researc hers  sugge sted\\nthat aband oning  the GAF altoget her in favor of a 5-poin t scale, might mak e\\nratings mor e accurate.\\nOther researc hers  had ques tions about  the anchor point s of the scale,\\nbecause it is unclear whether other key words  or examples  would result in\\na better GAF. The anchor point s are indic ators that help the clinician\\nestablish the GAF rating. The  current anchor point s are gene rally inc lusion\\ncriteria. For example,  “occasional ly failing to maintain pers onal hygiene ” is\\na criterion that could result in a GAF rating of 20-11 . Some researc hers\\nbelie ve addin g exclusion criteria to the anchors  might promot e better inter-\\nrater reliability. An exclusion criterion might  be “do not rate GAF lower than\\n285\\n20 if the individual is clean but somewhat disheveled”.  \\nAs another example,  some researc hers  have expres sed concern that, as\\nmanag ed-c are companie s continue to set practice standa rds and quali ty\\nguide lines , and the trend towards  account ability for  clinical outcomes\\ncontinues  to grow, p ractitioner s may be unde r increas ing pres sure to use\\nGAF ratings and DSM d iagno ses in inapp ropriate ways to ensure\\ninsuran ce coverag e for treatment .\\nResearc h has also ident ified the prop ensity of  some clinicians to give\\ninflated or unre alistically low  GAF ratings because the GAF rating\\ninstructions in the DSM-I V-TR a re unclear.  In gene ral, inter-rater reliab ility\\nratings are low in the clinical setting because there is great variabilit y of\\ntraining  and experie nce levels amongs t clinicians. Thes e rating prob lems ,\\nalone  or in combinat ion, can lead to imprope r assessment of impair ment\\nseverity.\\n1. GAF ratings ar e not st andardi zed \\nThe GAF is neither standa rdized nor based on norma tive dat a. A GAF\\nrating compare s the patient with the distinctive popu lation of patients the\\nclinician has known. Th is limits direct compara bility of GAF scores\\nassigned  by differen t evaluat ors or even by the same e valuat or at\\nsubstantially dif ferent points in time.\\nAlthoug h the GAF rating is numeric al, the actual numbe r assigned  can be\\nmisleadi ng because the score does  not quant ify dif ferenc es in function\\nbetween peop le. For example,  a GAF s core of 75 does  not mea n a pers on\\nis functioning 10 units better than a pers on with a score of 65, nor does  a\\nGAF of 40 indic ate a pers on is functioning half as well as a person with a\\nscore of 80.\\nGAF ratings assigned  by differen t clinicians are inconsistent because of\\nthe lack of standar dization. In a clinical (i.e., treatment  and evaluat ion)\\nsetting, inter-rater reliab ility is gener ally low  because of variabilit y of\\ntraining  and experie nce levels among clinicians. This mea ns adjudi cators\\ncannot  draw relia ble inferen ces from differen ces in GAF ratings assigned\\nby differen t clinicians or from a single GAF score in isolation\\n286\\n2. GAF is not desi gned to predi ct outcome\\nClinic ians use the GAF to help plan and meas ure the impac t of treatment\\n(see DSM-I V-TR , p. 32). It is of limited value for assessing prog nosis or\\ntreatment  outcome a nd other meas ures  are better indicators of outcome.\\nFor example,  research sugges ts the highe st level of functioning for a\\nperio d of time is a better predic tor of prog nosis than the lowest  level of\\nfunctioning for a time perio d. \\n3. GAF ratings need supporti ng detai l \\nThe GAF scale anchors  are very gener al and there can be a significant\\nvariat ion in how cl inicians rate a GAF. For example,  if a claiman t has a\\nGAF of 20, it could mean that he or she is not maintainin g minimal\\npers onal hygiene  (a clinical observation),  or that the claimant  has some\\npotential to hurt himself or others (a clinical judgme nt). Interpreting the\\nGAF rating requ ires knowing what the clinician was focusing on when\\nassigning  the overall rating. Although  the DSM-I V-TR r ecommends\\nassigning  a rating reflecting the lower as sessment  when s ympto m severity\\nand level of functioning differ, evaluat ors rarely not e whether the score\\nreflects function, sympto ms, or both. \\nE. Weighing GA F ratings as  opinion e vidence\\nFor purp oses of the Social Security disability prog rams , when it comes\\nfrom an  acceptable medic al source, a GAF rating is a med ical opini on as\\ndefined in 20 CFR §§ 404. 1527 (a)(2) and 416. 927(a)(2). An adjud icator\\nconsiders  a GAF s core with all of the relevant evidenc e in the case file and\\nweighs  a GAF rating as require d by §§ 20 CFR 404. 1527 (c), 416. 927(c),\\nand SSR 06-0 3p, while keeping  the following in  mind: \\nThe GAF is unlike most other opini on evidenc e we evaluat e because it is a\\nrating. Howev er, as with other opini on evidenc e, a GAF n eeds  suppo rting\\nevidenc e to be given much weight . By itself, the GAF cannot  be used to\\n“rais e” or “lower” s omeon e’s level of function. The  GAF is only a s naps hot\\nopini on abou t the level of functioning.  It is one opini on that we c onsider\\nwith all the evidenc e abou t a pers on’s functioning.  Unless the clinician\\n287\\nclearly ex plain s the reasons behind  his or her GAF rating, and the perio d to\\nwhich the rating appli es, it does  not provide a reliable longi tudinal  picture of\\nthe claimant ’s men tal functioning for a disability analysis . \\nA GAF score is never dispositive of impairmen t severity. DO NOT:\\nGive c ontrolling weight  to a GAF from a treating source unles s it is well\\nsupported and not inconsistent with the other evidenc e.\\nWhen case evidenc e includes  a GAF from a treating source and you do\\nnot give it controlling weight , you must provide g ood reasons in the\\npersonali zed disability ex plana tion or decision notice. \\nEqua te any particular GAF score with a listing-level limitation. \\nYou c anno t use a GAF rating to determine  whethe r a claiman t’s\\nimpair ment  mee ts the diagn ostic criteria of men tal retardation in listing\\n12.05, because the rating lacks specificity, may not  reflect a claiman t’s\\nfunctioning over time, and is not a standardized meas ure of anything,\\nincludin g intelligence and adap tive beh avior. \\nEqua te a particular GAF score with a particular ment al residual  functional\\ncapacity as sessment . \\nThe GAF does  not mea sure the ability to meet  the ment al deman ds of\\nunskilled work. There have been  no publi shed studies  of how, or  if, GAF\\nscores relate to mee ting the deman ds of unskilled work. Additionally, t here\\nis no correlation between GAF scores and the B criteria in the ment al\\ndisorders listings.\\nQuest ions  \\nDirec t all program–re lated and technical ques tions to your RO support staff\\nor PSC OA staff.

Purpose\\nThis emerg ency  messag e (EM) identifies certain Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT)\\noccupations that are isolated. “I solated” occupations are occupations with jobs that “exist only  in\\nvery limited numbers in relatively  few locations outside of the reg ion where [ the individual\\nlives] ”; 20 CF R 404.1566(b) and416.966(b). This EM also ex plains that adjudicators may  not\\ncite work in those occupations to support a “not disabled” determination or decision that uses the\\nmedical-vocational g uidelines (20 CF R Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix  2) as a framework for\\ndecision making .\\nIMPORTANT: This g uidance does not apply  to determinations or decisions that are based on an\\nindividual’s ability  to do past relevant work. According ly, adjudicators may  continue to rely  on\\nisolated jobs at step four of the disability  evaluation process.\\nB. Background\\nAt step five in the sequential evaluation process for adult disability  claims (and at the\\ncorresponding  step in the medical improvement review standard used in continuing  disability\\nreviews), we must determine whether, considering  their residual functional capacity  (RFC), ag e,\\neducation, and work ex perience, an individual can adjust to other work that ex ists in sig nificant\\nnumbers in the national economy . In determinations and decisions in which the medical-\\nvocational g uidelines do not direct an outcome under our rules, we use the medical-vocational\\nguidelines as a framework for decision making . When we use the medical-vocational g uidelines\\nas a framework and make a finding  of “not disabled,” we must support the finding  with evidence\\n1\\n292\\nthat an individual can adjust to work that ex ists in sig nificant numbers in the national economy .\\nUnder our rules, isolated jobs are jobs that “ex ist only  in very  limited numbers in relatively  few\\nlocations outside of the reg ion where [ the individual lives] .” 20 CF R 404.1566 and 416.966.\\nOccupations with isolated jobs are therefore not considered “work which ex ists in the national\\neconomy .”\\nIn the medical-vocational g uidelines and our other rules, we take administrative notice of the\\nDOT and its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the\\nRevised Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (SCO), as reliable sources of information. W hile\\nthese publications provide information about the requirements of work, they  do not provide\\ninformation about how much work ex ists within occupations or where such work ex ists within\\nthe national economy .\\nIn developing  this g uidance, we used current federal employ ment data from the B ureau of L abor\\nStatistics’ Occupational Employ ment and W age Statistics (OEW S) prog ram for the y ears 2020\\nto 2022. The OEWS prog ram publishes data using  the Standard Occupational Classification\\n(SOC) sy stem. F irst, we summed the OEW S state level employ ment data for each y ear by  U.S.\\nCensus Division. The Census Divisions divide the states into nine g eographical areas, as is\\nexplained here. Then, we identified the SOC occupations with fewer than 1,000 employ ees in\\neach of the nine U.S. Census Divisions in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 OEW S panels. There are 35\\nSOC occupations that meet these criteria. W e then identified the corresponding  DOT\\noccupations, using  the Occupational I nformation Network (O*NET) DOT crosswalk file\\n(available here). Using  this method, we identified 114 DOT occupations, each of which\\ncorresponds to one of the 35 SOC occupations with jobs that ex ist in very  limited numbers in\\neach U.S. Census Division. W e will now consider these 114 DOT occupations isolated in all\\nregions of the country .\\nC. P olicy\\nUnder 20 CF R 404.1566 and 416.966, when we make a determination or decision at step five of\\nthe sequential evaluation, we will not deny  disability  benefits based on the ex istence of isolated\\njobs which ex ist only  in very  limited numbers in relatively  few locations outside of the reg ion\\nwhere the individual lives. W e have determined that the DOT occupations listed below currently\\nsatisfy  the reg ulatory  definition of isolated jobs in all reg ions of the country .\\nOur adjudicators may  not support a “not disabled” determination or decision under the\\nframework of the medical-vocational g uidelines by  citing  any of the following  occupations as\\nexamples of other work an individual can perform. W e will remove an occupation from this list\\nif we later determine that occupational data demonstrate that it is no long er isolated.\\n2\\n293\\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry Designation(s)\\n013.061- 010 AGRI CULTURAL  ENGI NEER professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 014 AGRI CULTURAL -RESEARCH ENGI NEER professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 018DESI GN-ENGI NEER, AGRI CULTURAL\\nEQUI PMENT professional and kindred occupations\\n013.061- 022TEST ENGI NEER, AGRI CULTURAL\\nEQUI PMENT professional and kindred occupations\\n021.067- 010 ASTRONOMER professional and kindred occupations\\n029.067- 010 GEOGRAPHER professional and kindred occupations\\n029.067- 014 GEOGRAPHER, PHYSI CAL professional and kindred occupations\\n045.061- 014 PSYCHOL OGIST, ENGI NEERI NG professional and kindred occupations\\n045.107- 030PSYCHOL OGIST, INDUSTRI AL-\\nORGANI ZATIONAL professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 014 DIRECTOR, STATE- HISTORI CAL SOCI ETY professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 018 GENEAL OGIST professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 022 HISTORI AN professional and kindred occupations\\n052.067- 026 HISTORI AN, DRAMATI C ARTS professional and kindred occupations\\n052.167- 010 DIRECTOR, RESEARCHmotion picture;

Purpose\\nThis emerg ency messag e (EM) clarifies and consolidates guidance related to evidentiary  support for\\ncertain “not disabled” determinations and decisions that use the medical-vocational guidelines (20\\nCFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix  2) as a framework for decision making . It explains heightened\\nevidentiary  and articulation requirements about certain Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT)\\noccupations whose continued widespread ex istence multiple courts have questioned.\\nB. Background\\nAt step five in the sequential evaluation process for adult disability  claims (and at the corresponding\\nstep in the medical improvement review  standard used in continuing  disability  reviews), we must\\ndetermine whether an individual can adjust to other work, given their residual functional capacity\\n(RFC) along  with their age, education, and work experience. In determinations and decisions in\\nwhich the medical-vocational guidelines do not direct an outcome under our rules, we use the\\nmedical-vocational guidelines as a framework for decision making . When we use the medical-\\nvocational guidelin es as a framework and make a finding  of “not disabled,” we must support the\\nfinding  with evidence that an individual can adjust to work that exists in significant numbers in the\\nnational economy .\\nIn the medical-vocational guidelines and our other rules, we take administrative notice of the DOT\\nand its companion publication, the Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised\\nDictionary  of Occupational Titles (SCO), as reliable sources of information. Social Security  Ruling\\n(SSR) 00-4p  explains that, when there is an apparent conflict between vocational expert (VE) or\\nvocational specialist (VS) evidence and information in the DOT, the adjudicator must elicit a\\nreasonable explanation for the conflict and explain in the determination or decision how the conflict\\nis resolved. For example, descriptions of occupations in the DOT may refer to job materials or\\nprocesses that have been replaced by more modern materials or processes identified by a VS or VE.\\n1\\n299\\nThis may  create a conflict that an adjudicator must address under SSR 00-4p .\\nSome courts have questioned whether some occupations continue to be performed in the manner that\\nthey are described in the DOT. To ensure that our decisions are adequately  supported and consistent\\nwith SSR 00-4p , we are clarify ing the evidence needed to resolve these potential conflicts and\\nsupport a finding  of “not disabled” with respect to the listed occupations discussed below.\\nC. Policy\\nAn adjudicator may not cite any of the DOT occupations listed below to support a framework “not\\ndisabled” determination or decision without additional evidence from a VS or VE supporting  the\\nadjudicator’s conclusion that, as the occupation is currently  performed:\\n•Its requirements are consistent with the individual’s RF C, and\\n•It exists in the national economy  in numbers that alone, or in combination with work in\\nother cited occupations, are sig nificant.\\nThe determination or decision must includ e or summariz e the VS or VE’s evidence that supports\\nsuch a conclusion. This requirement applies if the adjudicator intends to rely on any of the following\\noccupations as support for a framework finding  of “not disabled”:\\nDOT Code DOT Occupational Title DOT Industry Designation\\n209.587- 010 Addr esser clerical\\n249.587- 018 Docum ent Preparer, Microfilming business ser vices\\n249.587- 014 Cutter-and-Paster, Press Cl ippings business ser vices\\n239.687- 014 Tube Oper ator clerical\\n318.687- 018 Silver Wrapper hotel and r estaurant\\n349.667- 010 Host /Host ess, Dance Hal l amusem ent and r ecreation\\n349.667- 014 Host /Host ess, Head amusem ent and r ecreation\\n379.367- 010 Surveillance- System Monitor government services\\n521.687- 010 Almond Bl ancher , Hand canni ng and pr eserving\\n521-687-086 Nut Sorter canni ng and pr eserving\\n726.685- 010 Magnetic-Tape W inder recording\\n782.687- 030 Puller-Through glove and m itten\\n976.385- 010 Microfilm Processor business ser vices\\nNOTE : Alternatively , adjudicators may support the determination or decision with other\\noccupation(s) appropriate to the facts of the claim.

Background\\n1. New regulatory def inition of  PRW ef fective June 22, 2024\\nOn June 22, 2024, we implemented final reg ulations 89 F R 27653  Intermediate Improvement\\nto the Disability Adjudication Process Including How W e Consider Past W ork (PRW  Rule).\\nThe PRW  rule provides a new and less restrictive definition of PRW , see 20\\nCFR 404.1560(b)(1) , and Social Security  Ruling  (SSR) 24-2p .\\nThe new PRW  definition is less restrictive than the prior PRW definition in two way s:\\n•The relevant period considers 5 y ears rather than 15 y ears of past work, and\\n• Work that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2. Res Judicata\\nOur administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided it does not need\\nto be decided ag ain. W e apply  res judicata at all levels of the adjudication process to avoid\\ndeciding  an issue that we have previously  decided based on the same facts, same issues, same\\nparties, and same adjudicative period ( DI 27516.001).\\nRes judicata is applicable only  with respect to the period covered by  the prior final\\n1\\n303\\ndetermination or decision. The end of this date period will g enerally  correspond to the date of\\nthe prior final determination or decision, ex cept when the date the claimant last met the non-\\ndisability  requirements for entitlement ex pired prior to the date of the final determination or decision.\\nFor additional information about using  administrative res judicata for disability  claims,\\nsee DI 27516.000 and GN 03101.160 .\\nC. Policy\\nWe will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously  adjudicated period when\\nthe prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not disabled is dated prior to\\nJune 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found the individual could do:\\n1.PRW at step fo ur of the sequential evaluation process (SEP) and the PRW  cited is not\\nPRW  under the PRW  rule; OR\\n2.Other w ork at step f ive of the SEP, work ex perience was material to the decision, and\\nthe individual’s work ex perience is different under the PRW  rule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, we will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or dismiss\\na request for hearing  on that claim.\\nD. Procedures\\n1. Field Of fice (F O) Instructions\\nDo not apply  res judicata if a subsequent Title I I claim is pending  on or filed after J une 22,\\n2024, and we previously  made an administratively  final determination or decision deny ing\\ndisability  throug h the last day  the claim met the non-disability  requirements, and the\\nregulation basis code (RB C) for the prior denial is:\\na.

Alert the DDS to potential res judicata\\ndeterminations and add the following  messag e to the certified electronic folder (CEF ):\\n“DDS jurisdiction: potential denial on basis of res judicata. DDS review necessary .”\\nNOTE: In addition, do not apply  res judicata if any  of the additional requirements in DI\\n27516.001B  are not met or the ex ception in DI 27516.001E  (new and material evidence)\\napplies.\\n2. DDS Instructions\\na.Initial review of claims in which res judicata potentially  applies\\nThe DDS will assume jurisdiction to review cases identified by  the F O as potential res\\njudicata determinations, with the following  messag e to the certified electronic folder (CEF ):\\n“DDS jurisdiction: potential denial on basis of res judicata. DDS review necessary .”\\nIf any  of the requirements in DI 27516.001B  are not met, make a substantive\\ndetermination on the claim as ex plained in DI 27516.005D . Res judicata does not apply .\\nIf one of the RB Cs from sections D.1.a. or D.1.b. in this EM applies and the prior\\ndetermination or decision was before J une 22, 2024, review the claim to determine if res\\njudicata applies. F ollow the instructions in sections D.2.b. and D.2.c in this EM.\\nb.

Purpose\\nThis emerg ency messag e (EM) announces the ag ency’s chang e of position (CoP) on the use of\\ncollateral estoppel to adopt prior disability  determinations and decisions. I t provides g uidance on\\nhow this new policy  will be applied to potential collateral estoppel claims currently  pending  at\\nthe field office (F O), the Disability  Determination Services (DDS), the Office of Quality  Review\\n(OQR), the Office of Hearing  Operations (OHO), and the Office of Appellate Operations (OAO).\\nIt also provides g uidance on how this new policy  will be applied with respect to certain\\nadministratively  final determinations and decisions questioned in writing  within one y ear of the\\ninitial determination.\\nB. Background\\nA CoP occurs when a policy  or leg al precedent previously  used to adjudicate cases, which was\\ncorrect and reasonable when made, is chang ed because of amendments to the Social Security\\nAct, the reg ulations, the publication of Social Security  Ruling s, or new policy  considerations. See\\nDI 27505.020.\\nA CoP is g enerally  applicable as of its effective date. F or all pending  initial, reconsideration,\\nhearing , and Appeals Council (AC) review cases where the appeal request was timely  filed or the\\ntime for filing  has been ex tended, and for cases remanded by  the courts, this means the ag ency\\nwill g enerally  apply  the revised criteria to the pending  claim as of the CoP date.\\nIn general, we may  reopen and revise a prior final determination or decision based on a CoP only\\nunder the one-y ear rule (DI  27505.020B .1) and, in the disability  contex t, only  if the result is\\nfavorable to the claimant. F or more information about reopening  and revising  a determination or\\ndecision, see DI  27501.005. See also 20 CF R 404.988(a), 416.1488(a), and Hearing s, Appeals,\\nand L itigation L aw (HAL LEX) manual I -2-9 and I -3-9.\\nThis CoP, effective 7/13/2024, ex pands our use of administrative collateral estoppel to adopt a\\nprior favorable disability  determination or decision in a subsequent claim for a different disability\\n1\\n309\\nbenefit or Supplemental Security  Income (SSI ) pay ments. I n certain cases, we will not decide the\\nissue of disability  again if, based on our prior final determination or decis ion, we have already\\ndecided that the individual is disabled for the period in question, and we have not determined that\\ntheir disability  ceased. The new policy  will apply  not only  to subsequent claims and appeals filed\\non or after the CoP effective date, but also to claims pending  at all administrative adjudication\\nlevels as of the CoP effective date as well as certain previously  adjudicated claims in which (1)\\nwe or the claimant questioned the final determination or decision in writing  within one y ear of\\nthe date of the notice of the initial determination, and (2) the questioning  occurred after, or was\\nnot resolved as of the CoP effective date (see DI  27505.020).\\nC. Collateral Estoppel P olicy CoP\\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of disability  in a subsequent\\nclaim by  the same individual for a different disability  benefit or SSI  payments if, in our prior\\nfinal determination or decision, we have already  decided that the individual is disabled for the\\nperiod in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1. Both the prior determination or decision and new claim require application of the same\\nstatutory  definition of disability .\\n2. We have not made an intervening  medical determination or decision finding  that the\\nindividual’s disability  ceased.\\n3. The individual has not eng aged in substantial g ainful activity  since the prior established\\nonset date (EOD).\\n4.The EOD in the prior claim is on or before the date when the nonmedical requirements\\nfor entitlement are last met in the new claim.\\n5.The record with the prior favorable disability  determination or decision is not in\\nterminated status.\\n6.We do not have reason to believe that the prior disability  determination or decision was\\nwrong .\\nConsult DI  11011.001 for instructions on how to analy ze each of these criteria.\\nD. Claim  Identif ication\\nThis new policy  applies not only  to subsequent claims and appeals filed on or after the CoP\\neffective date, but also to claims we refer to as CoP claims.\\nFor collateral estoppel, we will proactively  identify  and process CoP claims. CoP claims are:\\n1. Initial claims and appeals pending  as of the CoP effective date.\\n2.Closed claims in which we or the claimant questioned the ag ency ’s prior final\\n2\\n310\\ndetermination or decision in writing  within one y ear of the date of the notice of the initial\\ndetermination.\\nQuestioning  the determination or decision in writing :\\n•The claimant files a subsequent claim for the same benefit alleg ing an onset date within\\nthe period adjudicated by  the prior determination or decision; or\\n•The claimant otherwise indicates in writing  that they  disag ree with the determination or\\ndecision.\\n•The Ag ency indicates in writing  that it is considering  reopening  and revising  the\\ndetermination or decision.\\nOne-Year Requirement: To meet the one-y ear requirement:\\n•A subsequent application, other written request for reopening  (express or implied), or\\nother written ex pression of disag reement with the prior determination or decision must be\\nmade within one y ear of the date of the notice of the initial determination; and\\n•The questioning  must either occur after or be pending  a response from us as of the CoP\\neffective date.\\nSee DI 27505.020 for more information on the one-y ear requirement.\\nNote on I mplied Requests to Reopen: A subsequent claim for a previously  denied benefit is\\nconsidered an implied request to reopen the prior determination or decision when the claimant\\nalleg es an onset date of disability  within the previously  adjudicated period. I n such cases, the\\nsubsequent claim satisfies the second CoP claim criterion if filed within one y ear of the date of\\nthe notice of the initial determination associated with the prior final determination or decision.\\nExample of an I mplied Request to Reopen: An SSI  recipient filed a disability  insurance benefit\\n(DIB) claim with an AOD of Aug ust 1, 2022. The claim was denied in an initial determination\\nwith a notice date of October 1, 2023. The SSI  recipient did not appeal the determination, which\\ntherefore became the final determination of the ag ency on that DI B claim.\\nThe claimant files a new DI B claim on Aug ust 27, 2024, with an AOD of November 15, 2022.\\nThis AOD falls within the period adjudicated in the final determination on the prior DI B claim:\\nAugust 1, 2022, throug h October 1, 2023. Therefore, this DI B claim is an implied request to\\nreopen the final determination on the prior DI B claim.\\nIn this ex ample, the subsequent claim was filed after the CoP effective date and within one y ear\\nof the date of the notice of the initial determination. Therefore, the implied request to reopen\\nmeets the one-y ear requirement. According ly, if the criteria in section C of this EM are met, we\\nwill reopen the final determination on the prior DI B claim and apply  collateral estoppel based on\\nthe individual’s ong oing eligibility  for SSI . We will apply  payment retroactivity  based on the\\nfiling  date of the orig inal DI B claim.\\nIMPORTANT: I n general in the disability  contex t, and for purposes of this CoP, we may  reopen\\n3\\n311\\nunder the one-y ear rule, based on the CoP, only  where revision would be favorable to the\\nclaimant (see DI  27505.020B .1).\\nE. Field of fice (F O) procedures f or CoP  claim s\\n1.Initial or reconsideration claim pending  at the F O\\nIf an initial claim or reconsideration appeal is pending  at the F O on or after the CoP effective\\ndate and collateral estoppel may  apply , the F O will ensure that all the criteria in section C of\\nthis EM are met.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies to the entire period in question, the F O will adjudicate the\\nclaim following  DI 11011.001E. I f the claim is pending  in EDCS, close the EDCS claim\\nas an F O Determination and select “Disability  established/pending  same issue” as the\\nreason.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies but an alleg ed onset date (AOD) earlier than the prior\\ndetermination EOD could provide for additional entitlement, the F O will determine the\\npotential onset date (POD) on the subsequent claim and, if the POD predates the prior\\ndetermination or decision EOD, follow the instructions in DI  11011.001F  and transfer the\\nclaim to the DDS.\\n•If collateral estoppel does not apply , the F O will not add the collateral estoppel flag  and\\nwill handle the claim under its normal procedures.\\n2. Pending  initial or reconsideration claim returned from the Disability  Determination Services\\n(DDS)\\nThe F O will review claims returned from the DDS to determine whether all the criteria in\\nsection C of this EM are met.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies to the entire period in question, the F O will adjudicate the\\nclaim following  DI 11011.001 and close the EDCS claim as an F O Determination and\\nselect “Disability  established/pending  same issue” as the reason.\\n•If collateral estoppel applies but an AOD earlier than the prior determination EOD could\\nprovide for additional entitlement, the F O will determine the POD on the subsequent\\nclaim and transfer the claim back to the DDS following  the instructions in DI\\n11011.001F .\\nIf collateral estoppel does not apply , the F O will:\\n•Remove the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag;\\nUpdate the POD;\\n•Add a Report of Contact (RoC) stating  “Collateral estoppel flag  removed, disability\\ndetermination needed” and providing  the reason why  collateral estoppel does not apply ;\\n4\\n312\\n\\\"Example RoC lang uage: “Collateral estoppel flag  removed; disability  determination\\nneeded.  Collateral estoppel does not apply  because the record with the prior favorable\\ndisability  determination or decision is in terminated status.”\\n•Add the following  subject line to the RoC: “Disability  Determination Needed”; and\\n•Transfer the claim back to the DDS.\\n3. Claims in which a prior final determination or decision is questioned in writing  within one\\nyear of the date of the notice of the initial determination (hereinafter, “one-y ear claims”)\\nIf the section C criteria are met, the F O will determine which component made the final\\ndetermination or decision on the prior claim.\\n• If the prior claim was finally  adjudicated at the F O or DDS level, the F O will reopen and\\nrevise the prior determination following  the procedures set out in this EM for pending\\ninitial or reconsideration claims.\\n•If the prior claim was finally  decided at the Hearing  or Appeals Council level, the F O will\\nadd the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  to the file and alert the\\ncomponent that made the prior final decision.\\nFO Reopening  Authority : For collateral estoppel CoP, the F O has the authority  to reopen\\ndeterminations made below the hearing  level when collateral estoppel applies. See DI\\n27501.005B .3.d.\\nPayment Retroactivity : For determinations made at the F O or DDS level that can be reopened\\nand revised under the one-y ear CoP requirement and where all the criteria are met to apply\\ncollateral estoppel, the F O will apply  payment retroactivity  based on the filing  date of the\\nclaim with the reopened determination.\\n4.Claims in which a prior final determination or decision is questioned in writing  more than\\none y ear from the date of the notice of the initial determination\\nWe may  apply  collateral estoppel in a subsequent claim even when we cannot reopen the\\nprior determination under CoP policy  because the date of the notice of the initial\\ndetermination is more than one y ear before the protective filing  date of the subsequent\\napplication.\\nProcedure and Pay ment Retroactivity : Do not reopen the prior determination but, if all the\\ncriteria in C of this EM are met, process the subsequent claim as a collateral estoppel\\ndetermination and use its filing  date — rather than the filing  date of the claim associated with\\nthe prior final determination — to determine appropriate retroactive entitlement.\\nOnset of Disability  Within a Previously  Adjudicated Period: W hen we cannot reopen a prior\\ndetermination or decision but the disability  criteria have since chang ed and provide a basis\\nfor establishing  disability  on a new Title I I application, onset of disability  on the subsequent\\nclaim may  be established within the period adjudicated in the prior determination or decision,\\nif supported by  all evidence (see DI  25501.250A.5 and DI  27505.020B .3).\\n5313\\nF. DDS P rocedures f or CoP  Claim s Pending at the Initial and Reconsideration Levels\\n1. Batch transfer of pending  claims\\nFrom J uly 20, 2024, throug h July 21, 2024, the Office of Disability  Information Sy stems\\n(ODI S) will initiate an automatic transfer (No Determination) of pending  electronic claims\\nfrom the DDS to the F O. Claims transferred will consist of all initial claims and\\nreconsideration appeals with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  where the\\nclaimant is in current or suspended pay ment status on another title or benefit ty pe. Claims\\nflagged as potential collateral estoppel and where the individual is not in current or\\nsuspended pay ment status will remain in the DDS’ jurisdiction.\\nFO technicians will be able to identify  the batch transfer claims via:\\n•The “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag ;\\n•The ND date of J uly 20, 2024, or J uly 21, 2024; and\\n•The \\\" FO Determination Requested” ND reason in the W orkload Action Center.\\nThe DDS will be responsible for reviewing  the remaining  claims to determine if the claim is\\nincorrectly  flagged or if it should be manually  transferred to the F O for a collateral estoppel\\ndetermination. I f the claim is incorrectly  flagged, remove the flag , and continue development\\nfollowing  usual procedures.\\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT manually  transfer any  collateral estoppel claims to the F O until after\\nthe automatic transfer is complete.\\n2. Claims ex cluded from batch transfer - unsuccessful closures\\nClosure will occur automatically  for most claims included in the automatic transfer of\\npending  electronic claims from the DDS to the F O, but certain claims may  fail to close\\nautomatically  (e.g., outstanding  items remain, such as a scheduled CE). W hen a claim fails to\\nclose automatically , it may  not be automatically  transferred to the F O. ODI S will send each\\nDDS a list of unsuccessful transfers.\\nEach DDS shall resolve unsuccessful transfers within their jurisdiction by :\\n•Resolving  any outstanding  items that are preventing  closure;\\n•Adding  the following  messag e to eView:\\nClaim returned to F O due to 7/13/2024 Collateral Estoppel Chang e of Position;\\n•Making  a “No Determination” (ND) determination with the reason “F O Determination\\nRequested” and include the Reason Detail “Collateral Estoppel Chang e of Position”; and\\n•Manually  transferring  the claim to the F O.\\n3. Unflag ged CoP claims\\nIf DDS finds a potential collateral estoppel CoP issue in a pending  claim that does not have\\nthe “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag, do not transfer it manually  to the F O\\nuntil after the automatic transfer has taken place. Once the automatic transfer has occurred,\\n6314\\nthe DDS will add the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  to the file and follow\\nthe steps in F .2 to ND and return the claim to the F O.\\n4. Office of Quality  Review (OQR) returns\\nEach claim with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  returned by  OQR to the\\nDDS will require review by  the DDS to determine if it must be manually  returned to the F O\\nfor a collateral estoppel determination.\\nThe DDS will follow the steps in F .2. to ND and return the claim to the F O.\\nG. Office of  Hearings Operations (OHO) P rocedures f or Pending CoP  claim s\\n1. Identification, Routing , and Administrative Processing\\nOHO reg ional offices (RO) will identify  pending  CoP claims which are identified with the\\n“Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  in eView. Each OHO RO will provide any\\npertinent hearing  office (HO) within their reg ion with a list of pending  CoP claims with the\\n“Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues” flag  in eView. HO manag ement or their desig nee will\\nadd the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues” (PCEI ) case characteristic to the claims in\\nOHO’s case processing  systems (HACPS and/or CPMS).\\nEach HO will be responsible for identify ing CoP paper claims pending  within the office and\\ndesig nating  them as such.\\n2. Evaluation Process\\nHO manag ement will assig n each claim to a Senior Attorney  Advisor or Decision W riter to\\nreview and provide a recommendation to the administrative law judg e (AL J) on whether the\\nclaim meets the criteria in section C of this EM, using  either the Case Notes section of\\nHACPS case processing  with a HACPS referral to the AL J, or the Remarks in CPMS with a\\nCPMS to-do to the AL J, as appropriate.\\nIf the AL J agrees that the claim meets the criteria in section C of this EM, the AL J will issue\\na decision adopting  the disability  finding  from the prior determination or decision.\\nIf the AL J decides that collateral estoppel does not apply , the AL J will proceed with\\nadjudicating  the claim. HO staff will add an eView messag e explaining  why  the collateral\\nestoppel criteria in section C of the EM are not met.\\n3. Effect of Evaluation on Hearing\\nIf collateral estoppel applies to the entire period at issue in the current appeal, the AL J will\\ndecide the claim on the record and not conduct an oral hearing  (See 20 CF R § 404.948 and\\n416.1448).\\nIf collateral estoppel applies only  to part of the period at issue in the current appeal, the AL J\\n7315\\nwill adopt the prior determination or decision only  for that portion of the period at issue and\\nthen proceed with adjudicating  the remainder of the claim.\\nExample: A subsequent Title I I claim features a POD that is earlier than the EOD for the\\nprior favorable determination or decision. Collateral estoppel cannot apply  to the period\\nbetween the current claim’s POD and the prior determination or decision’s EOD.\\n4. Processing  One-Year Claims\\nThe Office of the Chief Administrative L aw Judge will obtain a list of claims pending  at\\nOHO with the “Potential Collateral Estoppel I ssues Apply ” flag  in which an AL J issued the\\nprior final decision.\\nAn AL J will determine whether the prior decision may  be reopened due to the CoP, and if so,\\nwill issue a new decision apply ing the new collateral estoppel criteria.\\nH.

The Appeals Council  should award benefits based on the new evidence added to the record\\nfollowing  the prior remand order, coupled with the testimony of the medical and vocational\\nexpert, which support a finding  that the claimant is disabled.\\n5.Should the Appeals Council remand this case, it should direct that it be assig ned to a different\\njudge on remand, in accordance with HAL LEX I -2-1-55(D)(11).\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted that it had previously  remanded this case and that on remand, the ALJ\\n“discounted advice from medical and vocational experts.”   The Appeals Council noted that when\\nthe VE considered the limitations found by the ME with additional mental limitations, “that would\\npreclude the ability  to relate to coworkers or the public and to demonstrate reliability ”, the VE “could\\nonly identify  one job, a surveillance system monitor,” but he also testified that the “sedentary  job\\nbase would be significantly  eroded because of sit/stand option and the bilateral upper-ex tremity\\nlimitation, and the numbers furnished for the surveillance system monitor were even eroded.”  The\\nAppeals Council further noted that:\\nthe reduced range of light work that constitutes the established RFC . . . is consistent\\nwith sedentary  work pursuant to 20 CFR 404.1567 and 416.967 because of the 4-hour\\nstanding /walking  limitation.   In addition, the non-specific restriction in pushing  and\\npulling  and the sit/stand option resemble the hypothetical RFC to which [the VE]\\ncould only  identify  one job at reduced numbers.  F urther evaluation is warranted.  \\n338\\nAdditionally , the Appeals Council noted that the ALJ evaluated the Title II claim based on the wrong\\ndate last insured and, thus, further evaluation of this claim was needed.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to the evidence of record supporting\\nthe assessed limitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.  The hypothetical\\nquestions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole\\nand before relying on VE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between\\nthe occupational evidence provided by  the VE and the DOT;  \\n \\n•assig n the case to another AL J as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n•determine if it is necessary  to associate the claim files from the subsequent claims for title\\nII and XVI  benefits and issue a decision on the associated claims; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any  further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record, and issue a new decision.\\nCaveat : The HALLEX cite to request assignment to a new ALJ on remand has changed to HALLEX\\nI-2-1-55( D)(6)\\n339\\n340\\n341\\n342\\n343\\n344\\n345\\n346\\n347\\n348\\n349\\n350\\n351\\nLetter Brief #2  \\nTopics Addres sed:\\n•Need for Review by  Medical Staff at AC\\n•Listing  3.02A, Pulmonary  Impairment\\n•Severity  - Mental I mpairment\\n•Past W ork - 15 Year Rule\\n•New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.

Thus, the Appeal s Council determined that a “consultative pulmonary\\nexamination along  with an acceptable pulmonary  test and medical source statement are needed to\\nassess the severity  of her impairments.”  \\nAdditionally , new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council should be considered in determining\\nwhether the claimant has a severe mental impairment and, as appropriate, in assessing  her mental\\nresidual functional capacity .  Finally , the ALJ found that the claimant was “not disabled” because\\nshe has the residual functional capacity  to perform her past relevant work as a ticket taker and\\ndaycare worker.  However, as these jobs were not performed within the 15 year perio d to be\\nadjudicated in the new hearing  decision, they  are no long er relevant to the period at issue.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s pulmonary  impairment which should\\ninclude updated treatment records and a consultative pulmonary  examination with pulm onary\\nfunction testing  and medical source statements about what the claimant can still do despite\\nthe impairment;  \\n•consider the records received in connection with the request for review along  with the other\\nevidence to determine whether the claimant has a severe mental impairment;• obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational ex pert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base; and\\n•offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing .   \\nCaveat :  The letter brief cites to repealed 96-6p (replaced by SSR 17-2p) .

There is no indication that a pulmonary\\nfunction test was ordered or obtained and the decision does not explain whether such\\na test was later determined to be unnecessary .  As the hearing  recording  indicates that\\nthe Administrative Law Judge determined that such evidence was necessary , further\\ndevelopment and evaluation are warranted. \\nThe Appeals Council also noted that the ALJ found that the claimant did not have a listed\\nimpairment but the “decision does not include an evalu ation of the claimant’s impairments, including\\nin particular, her pulmonary  impairment, under the applicable L isting s in Appendix  I.”  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease\\nin order to complete the administrative record, noting  that the “additional evidence may\\ninclude, if warranted and available, a consultative physical examination, including  a\\n362\\npulmonary  function test, and medical source statements about what the claimant can still do\\ndespite the impairment; \\n•evaluate the claimant’s severe impairments, including  her chroni c obstructive pulmonary\\ndisease, under the applicable L isting s in Appendix  1;\\n•as appropriate, give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional\\ncapacity  and provide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of the assessed limitations; and\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

Regarding  the\\nearlier period, the Appeals Council stated that the hearing  decision failed to provide any evaluation\\nor rationale regarding  whether the claimant’s work activity  was an unsuccessful work attempt.  As\\nnew evidence was submitted to the Appeals Council indicating  that the claimant did not earn as\\nmuch as stated in the decision, and that her decision to stop working  may be related to her\\nimpairment, further evaluation of whether the claimant’s earning s constitute SGA was required.  \\nRegarding  the later period, the Appeals Council noted that the ALJ “did not discuss how the medical\\nrecord showed an improvement in claimant’s condition after April 1, 2010.”  “In particular, the\\n[ALJ] indicated her finding  that the claimant had improved was supported by the opinions of the\\nState agency consultants” who found that the claimant was capable of light work, but these opinions\\nwere render ed during “the time period the claimant was found to be disabled.”  Thus, further\\nevaluation was needed reg arding  whether the claimant ex perienced medical improvement.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•evaluate the new evidence and obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s\\nimpairments in order to complete the administrative record; \\n•further evaluate whether the claimant’s earning s from October 2008 throug h February  2009\\nconstitute substantial g ainful activity ; \\n•evaluate the issue of disability  cessation; \\n•if necessary , give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide\\n370\\nrationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

The Appeals Council also stated it was not clear that the\\ndemands of the job of escort vehicle driver, another job cited by the ALJ, were consistent with a\\nresidual functional capacity  which precludes concentrated exposure to hazards and extended\\nconcentration and attention.  Moreover, an audit of the audio recording  shows that the ALJ did not\\nask the vocational expert (“VE”) whether his testimony  was consistent with the Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles (“DOT) as required by  SSR 00-4p.  \\nFinally , Dr. XXX conducted a consultative ex amination and, based on her evaluation, determined\\nthat the “claimant’s alleg ed rectal and urinary  incontinence may be an issue in a work setting .”  Thus, \\nfurther consideration of the impact of the claimant’s alleg ed incontinence on the claimant’s ability\\nto work was necessary .    \\n \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide  rationale with\\nspecific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations;\\n378\\n•obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on\\nthe claimant’s occupati onal base.

While the evidence contained the report of\\nan examining  psychologist, the hearing  decision “does not make a specific finding  regarding  the\\nclaimant’s mental impairment at step 2 of the sequential evaluation process.”  Thus, “further\\nconsideration of the claimant’s medically  determinable mental impairment is warranted.”  \\nAdditionally , the hearing  decision fails to contain an evaluation of the treating  source opinion and\\n“[c]onsideration of this opinion is necessary .”  This source opined that the claimant has limitations\\nwith “pushing  and pulling , and she could never climb, crawl and only occasionally  balance, stoop,\\ncrouch, and kneel.”  Finally , the claimant submitted evidence prior to the issuance of the hearing\\ndecision which was not considered and needs to be considered on remand.         \\n390\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:  \\n•  update the medical evidence of record and give consideration to the evidence submitted prior\\nto the issuance of the hearing  decision; \\n•  evaluate the claimant’s mental impairment in accordance with the special techniqu e\\ndescribed in 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1520a and 416.920a; \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during  the\\nentire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of the assessed limitations and, in doing  so, evaluate the treating  source opinions and\\nexplain the weig ht given to such opinion evidence;\\n  •  if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert\\nto clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claim ant’s occupational base.

However, the decision does not “address or explain the weig ht”\\naccorded to this opinion.  Thus, further “consideration should be given to the claimant’s maximum\\nresidual functional capacity  as well as” this psy chiatrist’s opinion.  \\nThe Appeals Coun cil also noted that the decision stated that all of the claimant’s past work was\\nunskilled.

However:\\n[d]espite finding severe mental impairments, the assessed residual functional capacity\\ncontains no work related mental limitat ions as a result of claimant’s moderate\\nlimitations in concentration, persistence or pace.  Section 12.00G(3) of the listing s\\nindicates that concentration, persist ence, or pace refers to the claimant’s ability  to\\nsustain focused attention and concentration sufficiently  long enough to permit the\\ntimely  and appropriate completion of tasks commonly  found in work setting s (see\\nalso section 12.00A).  Further consideration of claimant’s maximum residual\\nfunctional capacity  is necessary .   \\nThe Appeals Council further noted that the hearing  decision does not evaluate the opinion of a\\ntreating  physician who “completed a medical assessm ent form and found that the claimant’s physical\\nlimitations would render him disabled.”  Even though  this assessment was completed after the\\nclaimant’s date last insured of December 31, 2013, there was evidence that the doctor treated the\\nclaimant since 2012.  Since this assessment is more restrictive than the ALJ’s RFC, “[c]onsideration\\nof this medical opinion as it relates to the period at issue is warranted.”          \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•  evaluate the claimant ’s mental impairment in accordance with the special technique\\ndescrib ed in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520a, documenting  application of the technique in the decision\\nby providing specific finding s and appropriate rationale for each of the functional areas\\n404\\ndescribed in 20 C.F .R. § 404.1520a(c); \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during  the\\nentire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of the assessed limitations and, in doing  so, evaluate the treating  source evidence and\\nexplain the weig ht given to such opinion evidence;\\n \\n•  if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert\\nto clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

However, the AL J’s RF C finding :\\ncontains no limitations that correspond to moderate difficulties in social functioning\\n(Finding  5).  This area of mental functioning  (now known as “interact with others”)\\nrefers to the abilities to relate to and work with superv isors, co-workers, and the\\npublic.  Examples include: cooperating  with others; asking  for help when needed;\\nhandling  conflicts with others; stating  own point of view; initiating  or sustaining\\nconversat ion; understanding  and responding  to social cues (physical, verbal,\\nemotional); respondi ng to requests, suggestions, criticism, correction, and challeng es;\\nand keeping  socia l interactions free of excessive irritability , sensitivity ,\\nargumentativeness, or suspiciousness (20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart  P, Appendix  1\\nsection 12.00E(2).  Further consideration of the mental residual functional capacity\\nis warranted (20 C.F .R. 404.1545(c); Social Security  Ruling s 85-16 and 96-8p).\\nThe Appeals Council further noted that the hearing  decision finds that the claimant, throug h the date\\nlast insured, had severe asthma, and alleged that physical exertion, dust, fumes, gases, and chang es\\nin the weather exacerbate his asthma symptoms.  Nevertheless, the RFC finding  “does not contain\\nlimitations ag ainst ex posure to these asthma trig gers, and the decision does not explain the reason\\nfor this omission.” Thus, further consideration was warranted.  \\n410\\nFinally , the AL J found that the claimant was limited to lig ht ex ertion, “with additional limitations\\nrequiring  use of a cane and an option to alternate sitting  and standing  at will, as well as no more than\\noccasional use of the rig ht arm for overhead reaching .”  The ALJ also found that these limitations\\n“have little or no effect on the light occasional base.”  However, “[t]here is no vocational evidence\\nto support this finding .”  The Appeals Council noted that:\\nA limitation on the ability  to stand or walk may significantly erode the light\\noccupational base (Social Security  Ruling  83-14), as may significant limitations on\\nreaching  and social functioning  (Social Security  85-15).  According ly, additional\\nvocational evidence is warranted to determine the effect of the residual functional\\ncapacity limitations of the light occupational base.

The psycholog ical consultant\\nprepared “an equals” memorandum in support of a partially  favorable decision, which was accepted\\nby the Administrative Appeals Judges. The Appeals Council found that the “evidence shows medical\\ndocumentation of a significant cognitive decline from a prior level of functioning  in complex\\nattention.”  The record also showed that the claimant was “involuntarily  hospitaliz ed due to being\\n‘out of touch with reality ’ and having  thoug hts of harming  self or others. . . .”  \\nThe Appeals Council issued a partially  favorabl e decision finding  that the claimant was disabled\\nsince December 27, 2015, based on a finding  that the claimant’s  impairments meet or medically\\nequals a listed impairment.  In so finding , the Appeals Council solicited the medical opinion of the\\npsycholog ical consultant.  The Appeals Council made the following  finding s:\\n•The Appeals Council considered the clinical evidence of record including  a memorandum\\nfrom the medical consultant to the Appeals Council and concluded that the severity  of the\\nclaimant’s mental impairment, based on B criteria evaluation even without certainty  of the\\ndiagnosis, equals the requirements of Sections 12.02 of the Listing  of Impairments beginning\\nDecember 27, 2015;   \\n418\\n•Beginning  December 27, 2015, the claimant had mark ed restrictions in understanding ,\\nremembering , or applying infom1ation; marked restrictions in interacting  with others;\\nmoderate difficulty  in concentration, persistence, or maintaining  pace; moderate difficulty\\nin adapting  or manag ing oneself.

The only remaining  job is that\\nof Cashier I I, which could not be performed g iven the AL J’s RF C assessment.\\n2.State ag ency medical consultants concluded that the claimant had moderate social functioning\\nlimitations and would have limitations in dealing  with the public.  Despite specifically  assig ning\\ngreat weig ht to these opinions, the ALJ assig ned mild social functioning  limitations and no\\nlimitations as far as contact with the public.

However, a review\\nof the DOT indicated that “cashier checker (DOT 211.462-014) is classified as semiskilled work and\\ncustomer complaint clerk (DOT 241.367-014) is classified as skilled work”  The Appeals Council\\nnoted that the “assessed residual functional capacity , however, includes a limitation for simple tasks\\nwith little variation . . ., which is inconsistent with semi-skilled and skilled work.” Thus, “further\\n436\\nconsideration of whether the claimant is capable of performing  her past relevant work is necessary .” \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that, on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during  the\\nentire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of assessed limitations and, in so doing , further evaluate the nonex amining  source\\nopinions and ex plain the weig ht given to such opinion evidence;\\n•give further consideration to whether the claimant has past relevant work and, if so, can\\nperform it  and, if warranted, obtain vocationa l expert evidence to assist in evaluating\\nwhether the claimant can perform past relevant work; and\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert\\nto clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claim ant’s occupational base.

The\\nadditional evidence is new and material as it occurred prior to the ALJ’s decision. The claimant\\nwas incapacitated during  this time and understandably  not in communication with her prior\\ncounsel.  The records could not have been submitted prior to decision.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  concluded that the claimant did not have a minimally  severe mental\\nimpairment and improperly  rejected the detailed opinion and supportive progress notes of Dr.\\nXXX, a psy chiatrist.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council issued a partially  favorable decision which applied the borderline age criteria\\nand used evidence about the claimant’s past relevant work as an additional factor to justify  the\\nborderli ne age onset.  The Appeals Council found that the ALJ’s decision did not adequately\\nconsider the evidence from the claimant’s treating  psychiatrist in determining  the claimant’s RFC. \\nThe psychiatrist’s notes “provide a longitudinal picture” of the claimant’s functioning  which\\nconsistently indicated the claimant had some problems with speech, labile mood, tangential thoug hts,\\nand impaired memory .  The Appeals Council gave some weight to the treating  psychiatrist’s\\nopinions.\\n \\nThe Appeals Council further found that while the evidence of the July 2017 stroke  shows\\n“significant impact on her ambulation,  speech, cognitive capacity  and extremities, this evidence does\\nnot meet the durational requirements of the reg ulations” and was therefore non-severe.  However,\\nthe Council noted that the 2017 stroke resulted in problems with communication and use of her left\\nside, and:\\nthese other factors support the application of 20 CFR 404.963(b) in finding  that the\\nage-55 requirement is effectively  met before the claimant actually  attain[ ed] age 55\\non October 4, 2017.  The Appeals Council used the older age categ ory to find that the\\nclaimant’s disability  began on August 2, 2017, approx imately  three months prior to\\nher actual attainment of age 55.  Prior to this date, we find at step 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation there were other jobs existing  in the national economy  that the claimant\\n446\\nwas able to perform and was therefore not disabled.    \\n    \\nIn awarding  benefits, the Appeals Council considered the entire record and found, in pertinent part: \\n•The claimant has the following  severe impairmen ts: coronary  artery  disease status post\\nmyocardial infarctions in 2003, 2012, and 2016; history  of cerebrovascular accidents in 2012\\nand 2013; obesity  and major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe and vascular dementia.\\n•The claimant has the residual functional capacity  to perform light work except that she has\\nthe following  non-ex ertional limitations that reduce her capacity  to perform the full range of\\nlight work: she can never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; cannot perform around hazards;\\ncan frequently  climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; cannot\\nperform in concentrated exposure to ex treme hot or cold temperatures, wetness, humidity ,\\nor vibration; is able to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace for two hour periods; and\\nwith customary  breaks, can complete an eight-hour day and forty -hour week without special\\nsupervision. The claimant further has mental restrictions to simple, routine tasks at the\\nunskilled work level.\\n•The claimant is unable to perform her past relevant work as an Office Manag er and as a Data\\nEntry  Clerical Assistant.  \\n•The claimant has at least a hig h school education and is able to communicate in Eng lish. \\n•The claimant has no work skills that are transferable to skilled or semiskilled occupations\\nwithin her residual functional capacity .  \\n•Prior to August 2, 2017, the claimant was under  age 55, and was considered to be an\\nindividual closely  approaching  advanced ag e. \\n•As of August 2, 2017, the claimant was less than 3 months of attaining  the age of 55 on\\nOctober 4, 2017.   Other factors support the application of 20 CFR 404.963(b) in finding  that\\nthe age 55 requirement is effectively  met before the claimant actually  attained age 55 on\\nOctober 4, 2017.  As of age 55, based on a chang e in age categ ory, Medical Vocational Rule\\n202.04 applies and directs a finding  that the claimant was disabled because she is limited to\\nlight unskilled work with no transferable skills. \\n•The claimant has been disabled as defined in the Social Security  Act since August 2, 2017. \\nCaveat :  SSA revised how it considers and articulates medical opinions and repealed the\\nregulations and rulings pertaining to treating physicians, effective for claims filed on or after\\nMarch 27, 2017.

Addit ionally , the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the\\nclaimant’s lumbar and cervical spine impairments.   The Appeals Council noted that:\\n[t]he evidence of record indicates that the claimant soug ht treatment for back pain. \\nTreatment notes dated July 20, 2015 and September 11, 2015 indicate that the\\nclaimant was diagnosed with post laminectomy  syndrome of the lumbar spine and\\ncervical degenerative disc disease . . . .

The ALJ found the claimant’s impair ments of\\naffective disorder and alcohol abuse were non-severe.  “However, despite the claimant’s varied\\ncompliance with treatment, the record consiste ntly reflects diagnoses of mental impairments\\n(variably  bipolar disorder, schiz oaffective disorder, and depression)” and  “while the claimant had\\na normal  mental status examination,” his doctor “still recommended the claimant attend weekly\\ntherapy ” and the “record also reflects the claimant was unable to keep any job he obtained due to his\\nsymptoms.”  Thus, further consideration of the nature and severi ty of the claimant' s mental\\nimpairments was warranted.  Additionally , the decision cited Social Security  Ruling  96-2p, 96-5p\\n96-6p and 06-03p, which were rescinded effective March 27, 2017.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s mental impairments in order to\\ncomplete the administrative record in accordance with the regulatory  standard regarding\\nexisting  medical evidence  which may include, if warranted and available, a consultative\\npsycholog ical evaluation examination with psycholog ical testin g and medical source\\nopinions about what the claimant can still do despite the impairments;  \\n•further consider the nature and severity  of the claimant’s mental impairments and any impact\\nthey have on the claimant’s ability  to perform work related activities.

The ALJ found that based on the claimant’s medical-vocational profile, she could perform\\nother jobs including  mail sorter (DOT #222.687-022); routing  clerk (DOT #222.587-038) and\\nmerchandise marker (DOT #209.l587-034).  While the ALJ stated in the hearing  decision that the\\nVE’s testimony  was consistent with the information contained in the DOT, a “review of the relevant\\nDOT descriptions shows that all three jobs identified by the vocational expert which the claimant\\nwas found capable of performing  involve frequent reaching ” while the “claimant’s residual\\nfunctional assessment limits her to occasional reaching  overhead.”  \\n484\\nMoreover, an “audit of the hearing  recording  shows that the vocational expert was not asked whether\\nher testimony  was consistent with the DOT and therefore there was no testimony  taken regarding  this\\ndiscrepancy ” as required by SSR 00-4p. Thus, supplemental testimony  from a vocational expert was\\nrequired.   \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s physical and mental impairments in\\norder to complete the admi nistrative record in accordance with the regulatory  standards\\nregarding  consultative examinations and existing  medical eviden ce, noting that the additional\\nevidence may include, if warranted and available, consultative physical and mental status\\nexaminations with psycholog ical testing and medical source opinions about what the\\nclaimant can still do despite the impairments;  \\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

Additionally , the hearing  decision does not adequately  “address the\\npresumption of non-disability  arising  from the prior unfavorable hearing decision and/or finding s\\nmade by a previous [ALJ] regarding  the claimant’s disability , as required by Acquiescence Ruling\\n97-4(9 ): Chavez v. Bowen .”   \\nThe Appeals Council noted that in the prior decision, the ALJ found that the claimant could perform\\na reduced range of light work and could not perform his past relevant work as a baggage handler but\\ncould perform other work.  “The hearing  decision does not provide adequate rationale, addressing\\nthe prior decision’s finding s, for finding  that the claimant is capable of a range [of] medium work,\\nand can perform his past relevant work as a cleaner/bag gage handler.”  Therefore, further\\nconsideration is needed in accordance with AR 97-4(9) and HAL LEX I -5-4-60.  \\nThe Appeals Council also noted that the vocational expert testified that the claimant’s past relevant\\nwork as a bag gage handler was a “composite job” which:\\n“have significant elements of two or more occupations and, as such, have no\\ncounterpart  in the DOT.”  (Prog ram Operations Manual System (POMS DI\\n492\\n25005.020B ).  When comparing  the claimant’s residual functional capacity\\nassessment to a composite job as it was performed, an adjudicator may “find the\\nclaimant capable of performing  the composite job only  if he or she can perform all\\nparts of the job” (Id.).  The claimant stated that he lifted 50 pounds frequently  and 50\\npounds occasionally  when performing  this job (Ex hibit 5E).  However, the hearing\\ndecision limits the claimant to medium work, which it defines as lifting  50 pounds\\noccasionally  and 25 pounds frequently  (Finding  5).  Therefore, the claimant cannot\\nperform this composite job, given his RFC, because he cannot lift and carry  50\\npounds frequently . Further evaluation of the claimant' s past relevant work is\\nnecessary .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•consider whether the claimant’s 2017 and 2018 earning s constitute substantial gainful\\nactivity ;\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the\\nassessed limitations and, in so doing , address the presumption of non-disability  arising  from\\nthe prior unfavorable hearing  decision and/or finding s made by the previous ALJ regarding\\nthe claimant’s disability  according  to AR 97-4(9): Chavez v.

Also, the VE testified\\nhe can no longer perform his past work because of his severe impairments and that while his past\\nwork was semi-sk illed, he had no transferable skills to light or sedentary  work but did not testify\\nregarding  whether he has transferable skills to medium jobs.  Thus, clarificatio n of whether the\\nclaimant has transferable skills to other work was needed to determine if the special profile applies\\nand directs a finding  of disability . \\nThe Appeals Council also received additional evidence with the request for review, which it found\\nwas new, material, and related back to the period at issue and there was a reasonable probability  that\\nthe additional evidence would chang e the outcome of the decision.  Also, the claimant showed good\\ncause for why  the evidence was not submitted earlier. \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s back and neck impairments in order\\nto complete the administ rative record in accordance with the regulatory  standards regarding\\nconsultative examinations and existing medical evidence, noting  that the additional\\nevidence may include, if warranted and available, consultative physical examinations and\\nmedical source opinions about what the claimant can still do despite the impairment;\\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base, noting that the hypothetical questions\\n528\\nshould reflect the specific capacity /limitation s established by the record as a whole. \\nFurther, before relying on the vocational expert evidence the ALJ will identify  and resolve\\nany conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the vocational expert and\\ninformation in the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles (DOT); \\n•consider whether the special profile for Lifetime Commitment to a Field of Work applies;\\nand\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing .  \\nCaveat : SSA has issued new SSR 24-1p, which explains how SSA applies the three medical-\\nvocational profiles - (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2)  no work profile; and (3) lifetime\\ncommitment profile.

Remand is warranted due to the ALJ’s erroneous evaluation of the claimant’s subjective\\ncomplaints.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council found that the ALJ’s RFC finding  does not provide a clear statement of and\\nrationale for the claimant' s maximum remaining  ability  to perform work.  The RFC finding  states\\nthat the claimant “can work in the same room with coworkers,” but it is not clear what impairment\\nthis limitation addresses, and the decision does not provide an ex planation. \\nAdditionally , the hearing  decision finds at step three of the sequential evaluation process that the\\nclaimant has a moderate limitation in interacting  with others but the RFC assessment only\\naddressed interaction with the public, finding  she could have “basic, momentary , casual contact”\\nwith the public, but did not provide for any limitations regarding  interaction with coworkers or\\nsupervisors.  Finally , the RFC finding  states the claimant will work “with more than 85%\\nefficiency ” but does not cite to support in the record for this limitation.  The Appeals Council also\\nfound that the step five finding  was unsupp orted as the vocational expert was asked about\\nlimitations that were omitted from the RFC finding ; therefore, further consideration of the\\nclaimant' s ability  to perform other work is warranted. \\n536\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s max imum residual functional capacity,\\ndirecting  the ALJ to “[s]tate a clear, persuasive, and orderly rationale with specific\\nreferences to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations”;  \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s ability  to perform other work at step five of the\\nsequential evaluation process and clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations in the\\nresidual functional capacity  on the claimant’s occupational base and obtain further\\nvocational evidence if necessary ; and\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision.  \\n537\\n538\\n539\\n540\\n541\\n542\\n543\\n544\\n545\\nLetter Brief #23\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Exhibit L ist Deficiency\\n• Incomplete Record\\n• Weight of Non-Ex amining  Reviewing  State Ag ency  Consultant \\n• Past Relevant W ork – Not SGA\\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• Treating  Physician’s Opinion (claim filed prior to 3/27/17) \\n• Treatment Reg imen\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.The ex hibit list to the AL J’s Unfavorable Decision is blank.\\n2.The Commissioner has been unable to provide a complete administrative record with hearing\\nrecording  to date.\\n3.Work activity  as a cashier does not meet the criteria of “past relevant work” at step four.\\n4.The RF C finding  is incomplete.\\n5.The RFC finding  is unsupported by medical opinion evidence or substantial evidence of record.\\n6.The treating  medical source opinion was rejected for unsupported reasons.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council found the evidentiary  record was not compiled properly  and significant\\nmedical evidence was not considered.

As the hearing  decision does\\nnot appropriately  evaluate the impairment in accordance with SSR 12-2p, further evaluation of the\\nclaimant’s medically  determinable fibromy algia is warranted.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•adjudicate the claim throug h the date last insured and further determine whether the\\nclaimant is disabled under the five-step sequential evaluation process; \\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s impairments in order to complete the\\nadministrative record, noting  that the additional evidence may include, if warranted and\\n556\\navailable, a consultative examination  and medical source statement  about what the\\nclaimant can still do despite the impairment;\\n•at step two of the sequential evaluation process, further evaluate the claimant’s medically\\ndeterminable impairment of fibromy algia sy ndrome in accordance with SSR 12-2p; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a decision.\\n557\\n558\\n559\\n560\\n561\\n562\\n563\\n564\\n565\\nLetter Brief #25\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Failure to I ncorporate Unrejected L imitations into the RF C\\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions - Consistency  Factor\\nArguments:\\n1.Despite stating  that he found the State agency  physician opinions “persuasive” at the initial and\\nreconsideration levels of review, the ALJ failed to explain why he was not incorporating  their\\nopinions in the RF C assessment.  \\n2.Similarly , despite reportedly  finding  the State agency  psycholog ists’ opinions to be persuasive,\\nthe ALJ failed to explain why he was not incorporating  their opinions into the mental RFC\\nassessment. \\n3.The ALJ erroneously rejected the opinions of two examining  psycholog ists as supposedly  being\\ninconsistent with the record.  Contrary  to the ALJ’s decision, both opinions are consistent with\\neach other and with the medical evidence and historical evidence of record.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted that despite finding  the opinions of both State agency  medical\\nconsultants to be “persuasive,”  the ALJ failed to incorporate physical limitations they found into\\nthe RFC assessment that the claimant needed to period ically alternate sitting  and standing  and a\\nlimitation to occasional bilateral fingering.  As the hearing  decision does not explain why these\\nlimitations were not included, further evaluation of these opinions and the physical RFC\\nassessment is warranted.   \\nThe ALJ also found the opinions of the State agency psycholog ical consultants to be “persuasive,”\\nbut failed to incorporate limitations they  found into the RF C assessment that the claimant would\\nfunction best with a “supportive” manag er and can perform simple tasks in a “supportive” routine\\nwork setting .

Claimant’s primary  care records were not updated\\nsince February  2019.  The ALJ incorrectly  and repeatedly  relied on the lack of treatment since\\nFebruary  2019 as a basis for rejecting  the severity  of claimant’s impairments and the opinions\\nof ex amining  providers.        \\n2.The ALJ erred in rejecting the opinion of the claimant’s treating  physician that she can only\\nstand/walk for four hours in an eight hour day and the opinion of another physician regarding\\nthe claimant’s mental impairm ents.  Due to the incomplete record, the ALJ was under the\\nmistaken impression that these opinions were not consistent with the evidence. \\n3.An examining  physician examined the claimant and reviewed the medical evidence of record. \\nHis opinion establishes that claimant was unable to perform full time substantial gainful\\nemploy ment since her onset date.  \\nAppea ls Counci l Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council received additional evidence from an examining  physician which suggested\\nthat the claimant is more limited than the ALJ found and determined that this additional evidence\\nis new, material, and relates to the period at issue. The evidence presents a reasonable probability\\nthat it will chang e the outcome as the physician opined that the claimant has limitations that would\\nexclude a full range of sedentary  work.  The Appeals Council found that there was good cause for\\nnot submitting  the evidence earlier as it did not exist before the decision was issued. Consideration\\nof this evidence is warranted.\\nThe decision cites “lack of treatment” as a factor inconsistent with the claimant ’s subjective\\nalleg ations.  However, the claimant submitted evidence to the Appeals Council showing  that she\\nreceived treatment throug hout the period at issue. Further consideration of the claim ant's subjective\\nalleg ations is warranted.  \\nThe decision indicates the claimant submitted evidence less than five days before the hearing\\nbefore the ALJ, and this evidence was admitted to the record.  However, no such evidence is\\npresent in the record.  F urther development of the record is warranted.  \\n578\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant' s impairments in order to complete the\\nadministrative record; \\n•as necessary , obtain evidence from a neurolog ist or other medical expert to help determine\\nthe functional limitations resulting  from the claimant’s impairments; \\n• further evaluate the claimant' s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms; \\n• further consider the claimant’s residual functional capacity  during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed\\nlimitations.

The ALJ’s decision describes\\nexhibits that are not contained in the ex hibit list attached to the end of the AL J’s decision.   \\n2.The claimant submitted new evidence, including  lumbar spine MRI finding s and \\ncervical/thoracic spine X-ray s.  This imaging is new and material as the testing  provides the\\nobjective evidence to support the medical opinions of record. Ther e is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  them sooner because the testing  had not y et been performed.\\n3.Prior to the AL J’s denial being  issued, the claimant provided clarification of the prescription\\nof a rolling  walker.  The ALJ failed to discuss the submitted evidence and further erred in\\nfinding  that the claimant did not require a rolling  walker.\\n4.Given the claimant’s amendment of his onset date to November 13, 2016,  the ALJ erred  in\\nrelying heavily on medical opinions dated well before the amended onset date as a basis for\\nfinding  that the claimant was not disabled.  The current opinions of record are consistent with\\nthe evidence after November 13, 2016.  The AL J erred in rejecting  those opinions.  \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted the hearing  decision contains conflicting statements regarding  the\\nperiod at issue as it referenced two different dates regarding  the beginning  of the period.  These\\nconflicting  statements are consequential and require further clarification.  The Appeals Council also\\nnoted that the record included an un-ex hibited report of contact in the paper claim file indicating\\nthere is an abandoned iAppeal of a prior claim.  Because the current decision purports to adjudicate\\nan overlapping  period, program guidan ce requires consideration of whether to reopen the prior\\nunfavorable determination.  Because the claimant filed his current application within two years of\\nthe prior unfavorable determination, and alleg ed disability  during  the previously  adjudicated period\\nan implied request to reopen is present and must be addressed.  Further consideration and\\n586\\nclarification must be given to the proper period at issue and whether to reopen any prior\\nunfavorable determination.  \\nThe record is incomplete as it does not contain the State agency  disability  determination\\nexplanation from the reconsideration determination.  As a result, the hearing  decision does not\\nconsider the nonexamining source opinions from State agency  medical and psycholog ical\\nconsultants. Consideration should also be given to this evidence.  In addition, the record does not\\ninclude all of the exhibits listed on the exhibit list.  According ly, further action is required to ensure\\nthat the official record is complete.   \\nThe exhibit list is also incomplete.  W hen an AL J issues a less than fully  favorable decision, the\\nclaim file must contain an exhibit list in its final form to ensure that the claimant and representative\\nknow the information relied upon in making  that decision.  Further action is required to ensure that\\nall ex hibits are selected, arrang ed, and marked.  \\nThe record contains unex hibited medical evidence which was received after the hearing  and before\\nthe issuance of the decision.  If a decision has not yet been issued, the ALJ will accept evidence not\\ntimely  submitted or if the ALJ does not find the evidence admissible under the rules, they will\\nprovide the reasons for not accepting  the untimely -submitted evidence.  According ly, further\\nconsideration is necessary .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•as needed, further develop the record and obtain additional evidence concerning  the\\nclaimant' s alleg ed impairments in order to complete the administrative record;\\n• compile the official record in this case in accordance with the regulatory  directives and, in\\nso doing , consider and as needed exhibit the evidence that was not included in the official\\nrecord.  Exhibits should be selected, arrang ed, and marked pursuant to the guidance\\nprovided in HAL LEX-I-2-1-15 and I-2-1-20.

The hearing  decision must evaluate and assess the persuasiveness of the opinions.\\nAt the hearing , the vocational expert identified light jobs the claimant could perform consistent\\nwith the hypothetical which required “occasional handling  and fingering .”  However, the DOT lists\\nthese jobs as having  a “frequent handling  and fingering” requirement.  Relying on the vocational\\nexpert’s testimony , the hearing  decision found the claimant was not disabled because she could\\nperform these jobs. The hearing  decision is not legally sufficient because the VE’s testimony  on\\nwhich it relies conflicts with the DOT and is inconsistent with the hy pothetical.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to eviden ce of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations and, in so doing , evaluate the medical source\\nopinions.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical source provi de additional\\nevidence and/or further clarification of the opinion;  \\n• obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on\\nthe claimant’s occupational base and determine whether the claimant has acquired any\\nskills that are transferable, with very little, if any, vocational adjustment to other\\noccupations in accordance with SSR 82-41. The hypothetical questions should reflect the\\nspecific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole and before relying on the\\nvocational expert evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the\\noccupational evidence provided by the vocational expert and information in the DOT;  and\\n596\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision.\\n597\\n598\\n599\\n600\\n601\\n602\\n603\\nLetter Brief #29\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Severity  of Mental I mpairments\\n• Severity  - RF C Failed to Account for All Severe I mpairments \\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• RFC - Assistive Device\\n• Impact of Absenteeism due to F requent Medical Treatment\\n• Listing  1.04A, Musculoskeletal I mpairments\\n• AL J’s Listing  Finding  Lacks Support\\n• Vocational Testimony  Needed\\nArguments:\\n1.New medical opinion evidence submitted to the Appeals Council documents limitations which\\nwould preclude the ability  to sustain  work activities at any exertional level on a regular and\\ncontinuing  basis, is material, relates to the time period at issue before the AL J, and there is a\\nreasonable probability  that the additional evidence would chang e the outcome of the decision. \\n2.The ALJ erroneously  found that PTSD and depression were not severe impairments and he\\nerred in failing  to include mental limitations in his RF C finding s.\\n  \\n3.The ALJ’s physical RFC finding s are not supported by substantial evidence in the \\nadministrative record.\\n4.The ALJ abused his discretion by failing  to obtain vocational expert testimony  warranting\\nreversal for a new hearing  with VE testimony .  \\n5.

Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: last reviewed this case, particularly  given  the ALJ’s failure to recog nize that the pulmonary\\nfunction studies document that the claimant’s respiratory  impairment met the requirements of\\nListing  3.02A.\\n2.Remand is warranted given the ALJ’s contradic tory findings regarding  the severity  of the\\nclaimant  ’s depression and the ALJ’s reliance on the outdated opinion of the State agency\\npsycholog ical consultant. \\n3.As the ALJ relied on jobs which were performed outside the 15-year period, the ALJ’s past work\\nfinding  cannot be sustained. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council found that the record contains insufficient evidence regarding  the claimant’s\\npulmonary  impairment.  Thus, the Appeal s Council determined that a “consultative pulmonary\\nexamination along  with an acceptable pulmonary  test and medical source statement are needed to\\nassess the severity  of her impairments.”  \\nAdditionally , new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council should be considered in determining\\nwhether the claimant has a severe mental impairment and, as appropriate, in assessing  her mental\\nresidual functional capacity .  Finally , the ALJ found that the claimant was “not disabled” because\\nshe has the residual functional capacity  to perform her past relevant work as a ticket taker and\\ndaycare worker.  However, as these jobs were not performed within the 15 year perio d to be\\nadjudicated in the new hearing  decision, they  are no long er relevant to the period at issue.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s pulmonary  impairment which should\\ninclude updated treatment records and a consultative pulmonary  examination with pulm onary\\nfunction testing  and medical source statements about what the claimant can still do despite\\nthe impairment;  \\n•consider the records received in connection with the request for review along  with the other\\nevidence to determine whether the claimant has a severe mental impairment;• obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational ex pert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base; and\\n•offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing .   \\nCaveat :  The letter brief cites to repealed 96-6p (replaced by SSR 17-2p) .

There is no indication that a pulmonary\\nfunction test was ordered or obtained and the decision does not explain whether such\\na test was later determined to be unnecessary .  As the hearing  recording  indicates that\\nthe Administrative Law Judge determined that such evidence was necessary , further\\ndevelopment and evaluation are warranted. \\nThe Appeals Council also noted that the ALJ found that the claimant did not have a listed\\nimpairment but the “decision does not include an evalu ation of the claimant’s impairments, including\\nin particular, her pulmonary  impairment, under the applicable L isting s in Appendix  I.”  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease\\nin order to complete the administrative record, noting  that the “additional evidence may\\ninclude, if warranted and available, a consultative physical examination, including  a\\n362\\npulmonary  function test, and medical source statements about what the claimant can still do\\ndespite the impairment; \\n•evaluate the claimant’s severe impairments, including  her chroni c obstructive pulmonary\\ndisease, under the applicable L isting s in Appendix  1;\\n•as appropriate, give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional\\ncapacity  and provide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of the assessed limitations; and\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.  The hypothetical\\nquestions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole\\nand before relying on VE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between\\nthe occupational evidence provided by  the VE and the DOT.  \\n363\\n364\\n365\\n366\\n367\\n368\\n369\\nLetter Brief #4\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Substantial Gainful Activity\\n• Past Relevant W ork - Not SGA\\n• Unsuccessful W ork Attempt\\n• Closed Period of Disability\\n• Medical I mprovement\\nArguments:\\n1.The new evidence, which undermines the ALJ’s finding  as to substantial gainful activity  \\nfrom October 2008 throug h February  10, 2009, warrants chang ing the AL J’s decision.\\n2.The ALJ reversibly  erred by finding  that medical improvement occurred as of April 1, \\n2010, and that the claimant was no long er disabled as of that date.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on: \\nIn a case where the ALJ awarded a closed period of disability , the Appeals Coun cil vacated the\\ndecision with respect  to the time period both before and after the closed period.  Regarding  the\\nearlier period, the Appeals Council stated that the hearing  decision failed to provide any evaluation\\nor rationale regarding  whether the claimant’s work activity  was an unsuccessful work attempt.  As\\nnew evidence was submitted to the Appeals Council indicating  that the claimant did not earn as\\nmuch as stated in the decision, and that her decision to stop working  may be related to her\\nimpairment, further evaluation of whether the claimant’s earning s constitute SGA was required.  \\nRegarding  the later period, the Appeals Council noted that the ALJ “did not discuss how the medical\\nrecord showed an improvement in claimant’s condition after April 1, 2010.”  “In particular, the\\n[ALJ] indicated her finding  that the claimant had improved was supported by the opinions of the\\nState agency consultants” who found that the claimant was capable of light work, but these opinions\\nwere render ed during “the time period the claimant was found to be disabled.”  Thus, further\\nevaluation was needed reg arding  whether the claimant ex perienced medical improvement.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•evaluate the new evidence and obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s\\nimpairments in order to complete the administrative record; \\n•further evaluate whether the claimant’s earning s from October 2008 throug h February  2009\\nconstitute substantial g ainful activity ; \\n•evaluate the issue of disability  cessation; \\n•if necessary , give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide\\n370\\nrationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the\\neffect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

The Appeals Council also stated it was not clear that the\\ndemands of the job of escort vehicle driver, another job cited by the ALJ, were consistent with a\\nresidual functional capacity  which precludes concentrated exposure to hazards and extended\\nconcentration and attention.  Moreover, an audit of the audio recording  shows that the ALJ did not\\nask the vocational expert (“VE”) whether his testimony  was consistent with the Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles (“DOT) as required by  SSR 00-4p.  \\nFinally , Dr. XXX conducted a consultative ex amination and, based on her evaluation, determined\\nthat the “claimant’s alleg ed rectal and urinary  incontinence may be an issue in a work setting .”  Thus, \\nfurther consideration of the impact of the claimant’s alleg ed incontinence on the claimant’s ability\\nto work was necessary .    \\n \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide  rationale with\\nspecific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed limitations;\\n378\\n•obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on\\nthe claimant’s occupati onal base.

However:\\n[d]espite finding severe mental impairments, the assessed residual functional capacity\\ncontains no work related mental limitat ions as a result of claimant’s moderate\\nlimitations in concentration, persistence or pace.

Further consideration of claimant’s maximum residual\\nfunctional capacity  is necessary .   \\nThe Appeals Council further noted that the hearing  decision does not evaluate the opinion of a\\ntreating  physician who “completed a medical assessm ent form and found that the claimant’s physical\\nlimitations would render him disabled.”  Even though  this assessment was completed after the\\nclaimant’s date last insured of December 31, 2013, there was evidence that the doctor treated the\\nclaimant since 2012.  Since this assessment is more restrictive than the ALJ’s RFC, “[c]onsideration\\nof this medical opinion as it relates to the period at issue is warranted.”          \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•  evaluate the claimant ’s mental impairment in accordance with the special technique\\ndescrib ed in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520a, documenting  application of the technique in the decision\\nby providing specific finding s and appropriate rationale for each of the functional areas\\n404\\ndescribed in 20 C.F .R. § 404.1520a(c); \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during  the\\nentire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of the assessed limitations and, in doing  so, evaluate the treating  source evidence and\\nexplain the weig ht given to such opinion evidence;\\n \\n•  if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert\\nto clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

However, the AL J’s RF C finding :\\ncontains no limitations that correspond to moderate difficulties in social functioning\\n(Finding  5).  This area of mental functioning  (now known as “interact with others”)\\nrefers to the abilities to relate to and work with superv isors, co-workers, and the\\npublic.  Examples include: cooperating  with others; asking  for help when needed;\\nhandling  conflicts with others; stating  own point of view; initiating  or sustaining\\nconversat ion; understanding  and responding  to social cues (physical, verbal,\\nemotional); respondi ng to requests, suggestions, criticism, correction, and challeng es;\\nand keeping  socia l interactions free of excessive irritability , sensitivity ,\\nargumentativeness, or suspiciousness (20 C.F.R.

Further consideration of the mental residual functional capacity\\nis warranted (20 C.F .R. 404.1545(c); Social Security  Ruling s 85-16 and 96-8p).\\nThe Appeals Council further noted that the hearing  decision finds that the claimant, throug h the date\\nlast insured, had severe asthma, and alleged that physical exertion, dust, fumes, gases, and chang es\\nin the weather exacerbate his asthma symptoms.  Nevertheless, the RFC finding  “does not contain\\nlimitations ag ainst ex posure to these asthma trig gers, and the decision does not explain the reason\\nfor this omission.” Thus, further consideration was warranted.  \\n410\\nFinally , the AL J found that the claimant was limited to lig ht ex ertion, “with additional limitations\\nrequiring  use of a cane and an option to alternate sitting  and standing  at will, as well as no more than\\noccasional use of the rig ht arm for overhead reaching .”  The ALJ also found that these limitations\\n“have little or no effect on the light occasional base.”  However, “[t]here is no vocational evidence\\nto support this finding .”  The Appeals Council noted that:\\nA limitation on the ability  to stand or walk may significantly erode the light\\noccupational base (Social Security  Ruling  83-14), as may significant limitations on\\nreaching  and social functioning  (Social Security  85-15).

The psycholog ical consultant\\nprepared “an equals” memorandum in support of a partially  favorable decision, which was accepted\\nby the Administrative Appeals Judges. The Appeals Council found that the “evidence shows medical\\ndocumentation of a significant cognitive decline from a prior level of functioning  in complex\\nattention.”  The record also showed that the claimant was “involuntarily  hospitaliz ed due to being\\n‘out of touch with reality ’ and having  thoug hts of harming  self or others. . . .”  \\nThe Appeals Council issued a partially  favorabl e decision finding  that the claimant was disabled\\nsince December 27, 2015, based on a finding  that the claimant’s  impairments meet or medically\\nequals a listed impairment.

The only remaining  job is that\\nof Cashier I I, which could not be performed g iven the AL J’s RF C assessment.\\n2.State ag ency medical consultants concluded that the claimant had moderate social functioning\\nlimitations and would have limitations in dealing  with the public.  Despite specifically  assig ning\\ngreat weig ht to these opinions, the ALJ assig ned mild social functioning  limitations and no\\nlimitations as far as contact with the public.  The ALJ also failed to address other aspects of these\\nopinions that would also impact the claimant’s ability  to perform her past work.\\n3.The AL J incorrectly  stated that “there is no evidence of any  prescription of any  kind of hand\\nheld assistive device or any  indication that this is/was medically  necessary .” AL J Decision at\\n7.  The AL J failed to address the opinion of the treating  PA-C and Dr. XXX (neurosurg eon)\\nthat she continue to use her walker and the need for future cervical spine surg ery.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:   \\nThe Appeals Council noted that the hearing  decision found that the claimant retained a residual\\nfunctional capacity  to perform a reduced range of light work which did not include social limitations. \\nHowever, in so finding , the decision did not adequately  evaluate the opinions of two State ag ency\\nnonex amining  medical consultants who both opined that the claimant’s mental impairments would\\nresult in moderate limitations in her ability  to interact with the general public.   “The decision gave\\ngreat weight to both opinions, but did not provide an explanation for rejecting  these social\\nlimitations.”  Thus, the Appeals Council found that further consideration of the claimant’s residual\\nfunctional capacity  and of the nonex amining  source opinions was needed.\\nThe Appeals Council also noted that the ALJ found that the claimant was capable of performing  her\\npast relevant work as a cashier checker, cashier II, and customer complaint clerk.  However, a review\\nof the DOT indicated that “cashier checker (DOT 211.462-014) is classified as semiskilled work and\\ncustomer complaint clerk (DOT 241.367-014) is classified as skilled work”  The Appeals Council\\nnoted that the “assessed residual functional capacity , however, includes a limitation for simple tasks\\nwith little variation . . ., which is inconsistent with semi-skilled and skilled work.” Thus, “further\\n436\\nconsideration of whether the claimant is capable of performing  her past relevant work is necessary .” \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that, on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during  the\\nentire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in\\nsupport of assessed limitations and, in so doing , further evaluate the nonex amining  source\\nopinions and ex plain the weig ht given to such opinion evidence;\\n•give further consideration to whether the claimant has past relevant work and, if so, can\\nperform it  and, if warranted, obtain vocationa l expert evidence to assist in evaluating\\nwhether the claimant can perform past relevant work; and\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert\\nto clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claim ant’s occupational base.

The\\nadditional evidence is new and material as it occurred prior to the ALJ’s decision. The claimant\\nwas incapacitated during  this time and understandably  not in communication with her prior\\ncounsel.  The records could not have been submitted prior to decision.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  concluded that the claimant did not have a minimally  severe mental\\nimpairment and improperly  rejected the detailed opinion and supportive progress notes of Dr.\\nXXX, a psy chiatrist.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council issued a partially  favorable decision which applied the borderline age criteria\\nand used evidence about the claimant’s past relevant work as an additional factor to justify  the\\nborderli ne age onset.  The Appeals Council found that the ALJ’s decision did not adequately\\nconsider the evidence from the claimant’s treating  psychiatrist in determining  the claimant’s RFC. \\nThe psychiatrist’s notes “provide a longitudinal picture” of the claimant’s functioning  which\\nconsistently indicated the claimant had some problems with speech, labile mood, tangential thoug hts,\\nand impaired memory .  The Appeals Council gave some weight to the treating  psychiatrist’s\\nopinions.\\n \\nThe Appeals Council further found that while the evidence of the July 2017 stroke  shows\\n“significant impact on her ambulation,  speech, cognitive capacity  and extremities, this evidence does\\nnot meet the durational requirements of the reg ulations” and was therefore non-severe.  However,\\nthe Council noted that the 2017 stroke resulted in problems with communication and use of her left\\nside, and:\\nthese other factors support the application of 20 CFR 404.963(b) in finding  that the\\nage-55 requirement is effectively  met before the claimant actually  attain[ ed] age 55\\non October 4, 2017.  The Appeals Council used the older age categ ory to find that the\\nclaimant’s disability  began on August 2, 2017, approx imately  three months prior to\\nher actual attainment of age 55.  Prior to this date, we find at step 5 of the sequential\\nevaluation there were other jobs existing  in the national economy  that the claimant\\n446\\nwas able to perform and was therefore not disabled.    \\n    \\nIn awarding  benefits, the Appeals Council considered the entire record and found, in pertinent part: \\n•The claimant has the following  severe impairmen ts: coronary  artery  disease status post\\nmyocardial infarctions in 2003, 2012, and 2016; history  of cerebrovascular accidents in 2012\\nand 2013; obesity  and major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe and vascular dementia.\\n•The claimant has the residual functional capacity  to perform light work except that she has\\nthe following  non-ex ertional limitations that reduce her capacity  to perform the full range of\\nlight work: she can never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; cannot perform around hazards;\\ncan frequently  climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; cannot\\nperform in concentrated exposure to ex treme hot or cold temperatures, wetness, humidity ,\\nor vibration; is able to maintain concentration, persistence, or pace for two hour periods; and\\nwith customary  breaks, can complete an eight-hour day and forty -hour week without special\\nsupervision. The claimant further has mental restrictions to simple, routine tasks at the\\nunskilled work level.\\n•The claimant is unable to perform her past relevant work as an Office Manag er and as a Data\\nEntry  Clerical Assistant.  \\n•The claimant has at least a hig h school education and is able to communicate in Eng lish. \\n•The claimant has no work skills that are transferable to skilled or semiskilled occupations\\nwithin her residual functional capacity .  \\n•Prior to August 2, 2017, the claimant was under  age 55, and was considered to be an\\nindividual closely  approaching  advanced ag e. \\n•As of August 2, 2017, the claimant was less than 3 months of attaining  the age of 55 on\\nOctober 4, 2017.   Other factors support the application of 20 CFR 404.963(b) in finding  that\\nthe age 55 requirement is effectively  met before the claimant actually  attained age 55 on\\nOctober 4, 2017.  As of age 55, based on a chang e in age categ ory, Medical Vocational Rule\\n202.04 applies and directs a finding  that the claimant was disabled because she is limited to\\nlight unskilled work with no transferable skills. \\n•The claimant has been disabled as defined in the Social Security  Act since August 2, 2017. \\nCaveat :  SSA revised how it considers and articulates medical opinions and repealed the\\nregulations and rulings pertaining to treating physicians, effective for claims filed on or after\\nMarch 27, 2017.

Addit ionally , the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the\\nclaimant’s lumbar and cervical spine impairments.   The Appeals Council noted that:\\n[t]he evidence of record indicates that the claimant soug ht treatment for back pain. \\nTreatment notes dated July 20, 2015 and September 11, 2015 indicate that the\\nclaimant was diagnosed with post laminectomy  syndrome of the lumbar spine and\\ncervical degenerative disc disease . . . .

The ALJ found that based on the claimant’s medical-vocational profile, she could perform\\nother jobs including  mail sorter (DOT #222.687-022); routing  clerk (DOT #222.587-038) and\\nmerchandise marker (DOT #209.l587-034).  While the ALJ stated in the hearing  decision that the\\nVE’s testimony  was consistent with the information contained in the DOT, a “review of the relevant\\nDOT descriptions shows that all three jobs identified by the vocational expert which the claimant\\nwas found capable of performing  involve frequent reaching ” while the “claimant’s residual\\nfunctional assessment limits her to occasional reaching  overhead.”  \\n484\\nMoreover, an “audit of the hearing  recording  shows that the vocational expert was not asked whether\\nher testimony  was consistent with the DOT and therefore there was no testimony  taken regarding  this\\ndiscrepancy ” as required by SSR 00-4p. Thus, supplemental testimony  from a vocational expert was\\nrequired.   \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s physical and mental impairments in\\norder to complete the admi nistrative record in accordance with the regulatory  standards\\nregarding  consultative examinations and existing  medical eviden ce, noting that the additional\\nevidence may include, if warranted and available, consultative physical and mental status\\nexaminations with psycholog ical testing and medical source opinions about what the\\nclaimant can still do despite the impairments;  \\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base.

Additionally , the hearing  decision does not adequately  “address the\\npresumption of non-disability  arising  from the prior unfavorable hearing decision and/or finding s\\nmade by a previous [ALJ] regarding  the claimant’s disability , as required by Acquiescence Ruling\\n97-4(9 ): Chavez v. Bowen .”   \\nThe Appeals Council noted that in the prior decision, the ALJ found that the claimant could perform\\na reduced range of light work and could not perform his past relevant work as a baggage handler but\\ncould perform other work.  “The hearing  decision does not provide adequate rationale, addressing\\nthe prior decision’s finding s, for finding  that the claimant is capable of a range [of] medium work,\\nand can perform his past relevant work as a cleaner/bag gage handler.”  Therefore, further\\nconsideration is needed in accordance with AR 97-4(9) and HAL LEX I -5-4-60.  \\nThe Appeals Council also noted that the vocational expert testified that the claimant’s past relevant\\nwork as a bag gage handler was a “composite job” which:\\n“have significant elements of two or more occupations and, as such, have no\\ncounterpart  in the DOT.”  (Prog ram Operations Manual System (POMS DI\\n492\\n25005.020B ).  When comparing  the claimant’s residual functional capacity\\nassessment to a composite job as it was performed, an adjudicator may “find the\\nclaimant capable of performing  the composite job only  if he or she can perform all\\nparts of the job” (Id.).  The claimant stated that he lifted 50 pounds frequently  and 50\\npounds occasionally  when performing  this job (Ex hibit 5E).  However, the hearing\\ndecision limits the claimant to medium work, which it defines as lifting  50 pounds\\noccasionally  and 25 pounds frequently  (Finding  5).  Therefore, the claimant cannot\\nperform this composite job, given his RFC, because he cannot lift and carry  50\\npounds frequently . Further evaluation of the claimant' s past relevant work is\\nnecessary .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•consider whether the claimant’s 2017 and 2018 earning s constitute substantial gainful\\nactivity ;\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the\\nassessed limitations and, in so doing , address the presumption of non-disability  arising  from\\nthe prior unfavorable hearing  decision and/or finding s made by the previous ALJ regarding\\nthe claimant’s disability  according  to AR 97-4(9): Chavez v.

Also, the VE testified\\nhe can no longer perform his past work because of his severe impairments and that while his past\\nwork was semi-sk illed, he had no transferable skills to light or sedentary  work but did not testify\\nregarding  whether he has transferable skills to medium jobs.  Thus, clarificatio n of whether the\\nclaimant has transferable skills to other work was needed to determine if the special profile applies\\nand directs a finding  of disability . \\nThe Appeals Council also received additional evidence with the request for review, which it found\\nwas new, material, and related back to the period at issue and there was a reasonable probability  that\\nthe additional evidence would chang e the outcome of the decision.

The RFC finding  states\\nthat the claimant “can work in the same room with coworkers,” but it is not clear what impairment\\nthis limitation addresses, and the decision does not provide an ex planation. \\nAdditionally , the hearing  decision finds at step three of the sequential evaluation process that the\\nclaimant has a moderate limitation in interacting  with others but the RFC assessment only\\naddressed interaction with the public, finding  she could have “basic, momentary , casual contact”\\nwith the public, but did not provide for any limitations regarding  interaction with coworkers or\\nsupervisors.  Finally , the RFC finding  states the claimant will work “with more than 85%\\nefficiency ” but does not cite to support in the record for this limitation.

Rem and is warranted due to the ALJ’s erroneous evaluation of the claimant’s subjective\\ncomplaints\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council determined the hearing  decision incorrectly  found the claimant’s date last\\ninsured and, as a result, part of the insured period was not properly  adjudicated. Evaluation of the\\nclaim for disability  and disability  insurance benefits throug h the date last insured, or the date of a\\nnew decision, whichever is earlier, is warranted. \\nAt step two of the sequential evaluation process, the claimant’s medically  determin able impairment\\nof fibromy algia syndrome was found non-severe contrary  to the evidence of record which supports\\nthat the claimant’s fibromy algia syndrome may more than minimally  affect her ability  to perform\\nwork related activity  for a period of at least 12 continuous months. As the hearing  decision does\\nnot appropriately  evaluate the impairment in accordance with SSR 12-2p, further evaluation of the\\nclaimant’s medically  determinable fibromy algia is warranted.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•adjudicate the claim throug h the date last insured and further determine whether the\\nclaimant is disabled under the five-step sequential evaluation process; \\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s impairments in order to complete the\\nadministrative record, noting  that the additional evidence may include, if warranted and\\n556\\navailable, a consultative examination  and medical source statement  about what the\\nclaimant can still do despite the impairment;\\n•at step two of the sequential evaluation process, further evaluate the claimant’s medically\\ndeterminable impairment of fibromy algia sy ndrome in accordance with SSR 12-2p; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a decision.\\n557\\n558\\n559\\n560\\n561\\n562\\n563\\n564\\n565\\nLetter Brief #25\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Failure to I ncorporate Unrejected L imitations into the RF C\\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions - Consistency  Factor\\nArguments:\\n1.Despite stating  that he found the State agency  physician opinions “persuasive” at the initial and\\nreconsideration levels of review, the ALJ failed to explain why he was not incorporating  their\\nopinions in the RF C assessment.  \\n2.Similarly , despite reportedly  finding  the State agency  psycholog ists’ opinions to be persuasive,\\nthe ALJ failed to explain why he was not incorporating  their opinions into the mental RFC\\nassessment. \\n3.The ALJ erroneously rejected the opinions of two examining  psycholog ists as supposedly  being\\ninconsistent with the record.  Contrary  to the ALJ’s decision, both opinions are consistent with\\neach other and with the medical evidence and historical evidence of record.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted that despite finding  the opinions of both State agency  medical\\nconsultants to be “persuasive,”  the ALJ failed to incorporate physical limitations they found into\\nthe RFC assessment that the claimant needed to period ically alternate sitting  and standing  and a\\nlimitation to occasional bilateral fingering.  As the hearing  decision does not explain why these\\nlimitations were not included, further evaluation of these opinions and the physical RFC\\nassessment is warranted.   \\nThe ALJ also found the opinions of the State agency psycholog ical consultants to be “persuasive,”\\nbut failed to incorporate limitations they  found into the RF C assessment that the claimant would\\nfunction best with a “supportive” manag er and can perform simple tasks in a “supportive” routine\\nwork setting .  As the hearing  decision does not explain their exclusion, further evaluation of these\\nfinding s and the claimant’s mental RF C is warranted.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of\\nrecord in support of the assessed limitations.  In so doing, evaluate the medical source\\nopinions and prior administra tive medical findings, noting  that, as appropriate, the ALJ may\\nrequest the medical sources provide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the\\nopinions; \\n• if warrant ed by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.\\n566\\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect the specific capacity / limitations established by\\nthe record as a whole and before relying on VE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve\\nany conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the VE and the Dictionary  of\\nOccupational  Titles (“DOT”); and \\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n567\\n568\\n569\\n570\\n571\\n572\\n573\\n574\\n575\\n576\\n577\\nLetter Brief #26\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited\\n• Incomplete Record \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• Treatment Reg imen \\n• 5-day  Rule for Evidence Submission \\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Good Cause for L ate Submission \\nArguments:\\n1.The record before the ALJ was incomplete.  Claimant’s primary  care records were not updated\\nsince February  2019.  The ALJ incorrectly  and repeatedly  relied on the lack of treatment since\\nFebruary  2019 as a basis for rejecting  the severity  of claimant’s impairments and the opinions\\nof ex amining  providers.        \\n2.The ALJ erred in rejecting the opinion of the claimant’s treating  physician that she can only\\nstand/walk for four hours in an eight hour day and the opinion of another physician regarding\\nthe claimant’s mental impairm ents.  Due to the incomplete record, the ALJ was under the\\nmistaken impression that these opinions were not consistent with the evidence. \\n3.An examining  physician examined the claimant and reviewed the medical evidence of record. \\nHis opinion establishes that claimant was unable to perform full time substantial gainful\\nemploy ment since her onset date.  \\nAppea ls Counci l Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council received additional evidence from an examining  physician which suggested\\nthat the claimant is more limited than the ALJ found and determined that this additional evidence\\nis new, material, and relates to the period at issue. The evidence presents a reasonable probability\\nthat it will chang e the outcome as the physician opined that the claimant has limitations that would\\nexclude a full range of sedentary  work.  The Appeals Council found that there was good cause for\\nnot submitting  the evidence earlier as it did not exist before the decision was issued. Consideration\\nof this evidence is warranted.\\nThe decision cites “lack of treatment” as a factor inconsistent with the claimant ’s subjective\\nalleg ations.  However, the claimant submitted evidence to the Appeals Council showing  that she\\nreceived treatment throug hout the period at issue. Further consideration of the claim ant's subjective\\nalleg ations is warranted.  \\nThe decision indicates the claimant submitted evidence less than five days before the hearing\\nbefore the ALJ, and this evidence was admitted to the record.  However, no such evidence is\\npresent in the record.  F urther development of the record is warranted.  \\n578\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant' s impairments in order to complete the\\nadministrative record; \\n•as necessary , obtain evidence from a neurolog ist or other medical expert to help determine\\nthe functional limitations resulting  from the claimant’s impairments; \\n• further evaluate the claimant' s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms; \\n• further consider the claimant’s residual functional capacity  during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed\\nlimitations.  In so doing, consider all medical source opinions and articulate their\\npersuasiveness and, as appropriate, the ALJ may  request the medic al sources to provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarificat ion of the opinions and medical source\\nstatements about what the claimant can still do despite the impairments; and\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record, and issue a new decision.\\n579\\n580\\n581\\n582\\n583\\n584\\n585\\nLetter Brief #27\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Period of Adjudication Requires Clarification \\n• Amended Onset Date Not Addressed \\n• Implied Reopening  of Prior Application\\n• Exhibit L ist Deficiency\\n• Incomplete Record\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Post-Hearing  Evidence Not Ex hibited  \\n• 5-Day  Rule for Evidence Submission \\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council  \\n• RFC-Assistive Device\\nArguments:   \\n1.The exhibit list attached to the ALJ’s decision is incomplete and does not include a listing  of\\nthe medical records submitted throug h the time of the decision.  The ALJ’s decision describes\\nexhibits that are not contained in the ex hibit list attached to the end of the AL J’s decision.   \\n2.The claimant submitted new evidence, including  lumbar spine MRI finding s and \\ncervical/thoracic spine X-ray s.  This imaging is new and material as the testing  provides the\\nobjective evidence to support the medical opinions of record. Ther e is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  them sooner because the testing  had not y et been performed.\\n3.Prior to the AL J’s denial being  issued, the claimant provided clarification of the prescription\\nof a rolling  walker.  The ALJ failed to discuss the submitted evidence and further erred in\\nfinding  that the claimant did not require a rolling  walker.\\n4.Given the claimant’s amendment of his onset date to November 13, 2016,  the ALJ erred  in\\nrelying heavily on medical opinions dated well before the amended onset date as a basis for\\nfinding  that the claimant was not disabled.  The current opinions of record are consistent with\\nthe evidence after November 13, 2016.  The AL J erred in rejecting  those opinions.  \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted the hearing  decision contains conflicting statements regarding  the\\nperiod at issue as it referenced two different dates regarding  the beginning  of the period.  These\\nconflicting  statements are consequential and require further clarification.  The Appeals Council also\\nnoted that the record included an un-ex hibited report of contact in the paper claim file indicating\\nthere is an abandoned iAppeal of a prior claim.  Because the current decision purports to adjudicate\\nan overlapping  period, program guidan ce requires consideration of whether to reopen the prior\\nunfavorable determination.  Because the claimant filed his current application within two years of\\nthe prior unfavorable determination, and alleg ed disability  during  the previously  adjudicated period\\nan implied request to reopen is present and must be addressed.  Further consideration and\\n586\\nclarification must be given to the proper period at issue and whether to reopen any prior\\nunfavorable determination.  \\nThe record is incomplete as it does not contain the State agency  disability  determination\\nexplanation from the reconsideration determination.  As a result, the hearing  decision does not\\nconsider the nonexamining source opinions from State agency  medical and psycholog ical\\nconsultants. Consideration should also be given to this evidence.  In addition, the record does not\\ninclude all of the exhibits listed on the exhibit list.  According ly, further action is required to ensure\\nthat the official record is complete.   \\nThe exhibit list is also incomplete.  W hen an AL J issues a less than fully  favorable decision, the\\nclaim file must contain an exhibit list in its final form to ensure that the claimant and representative\\nknow the information relied upon in making  that decision.  Further action is required to ensure that\\nall ex hibits are selected, arrang ed, and marked.  \\nThe record contains unex hibited medical evidence which was received after the hearing  and before\\nthe issuance of the decision.  If a decision has not yet been issued, the ALJ will accept evidence not\\ntimely  submitted or if the ALJ does not find the evidence admissible under the rules, they will\\nprovide the reasons for not accepting  the untimely -submitted evidence.  According ly, further\\nconsideration is necessary .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•as needed, further develop the record and obtain additional evidence concerning  the\\nclaimant' s alleg ed impairments in order to complete the administrative record;\\n• compile the official record in this case in accordance with the regulatory  directives and, in\\nso doing , consider and as needed exhibit the evidence that was not included in the official\\nrecord.  Exhibits should be selected, arrang ed, and marked pursuant to the guidance\\nprovided in HAL LEX-I-2-1-15 and I-2-1-20. Medical evidence not added to the official\\nrecord should be addressed by providing  supporting  rational for its exclusion to the extent\\nnecessary ;\\n• properly  identify  the period at issue;\\n• consider whether the claimant is disabled as defined in the Act for all relevant times; and\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a new decision.\\n587\\n588\\n589\\n590\\n591\\n592\\n593\\n594\\n595\\nLetter Brief #28\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Hypothetical Questioning  of the VE Not Consistent with RF C \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Unsupported RF C\\nArguments:\\n1.The step five finding  is based on clear error as all jobs cited exceed the RFC assessment\\naddressing  manipulative  limitations.\\n2.The ALJ did not articulate a finding  of persuasiveness for the treating rheumatologist’s\\nopinions.\\n3.The RFC is unsupported by substantial evidence and is based on the ALJ’s assessment of lay\\nevidence.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted that the hearing  decision does not contain an evaluation or assessment\\nof the persuasiveness of a treating source’s opinions, despite referencing  the opinions in the\\ndecision. The hearing  decision must evaluate and assess the persuasiveness of the opinions.\\nAt the hearing , the vocational expert identified light jobs the claimant could perform consistent\\nwith the hypothetical which required “occasional handling  and fingering .”  However, the DOT lists\\nthese jobs as having  a “frequent handling  and fingering” requirement.  Relying on the vocational\\nexpert’s testimony , the hearing  decision found the claimant was not disabled because she could\\nperform these jobs. The hearing  decision is not legally sufficient because the VE’s testimony  on\\nwhich it relies conflicts with the DOT and is inconsistent with the hy pothetical.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to eviden ce of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations and, in so doing , evaluate the medical source\\nopinions.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical source provi de additional\\nevidence and/or further clarification of the opinion;  \\n• obtain evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on\\nthe claimant’s occupational base and determine whether the claimant has acquired any\\nskills that are transferable, with very little, if any, vocational adjustment to other\\noccupations in accordance with SSR 82-41. The hypothetical questions should reflect the\\nspecific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole and before relying on the\\nvocational expert evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the\\noccupational evidence provided by the vocational expert and information in the DOT;  and\\n596\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision.\\n597\\n598\\n599\\n600\\n601\\n602\\n603\\nLetter Brief #29\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Severity  of Mental I mpairments\\n• Severity  - RF C Failed to Account for All Severe I mpairments \\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• RFC - Assistive Device\\n• Impact of Absenteeism due to F requent Medical Treatment\\n• Listing  1.04A, Musculoskeletal I mpairments\\n• AL J’s Listing  Finding  Lacks Support\\n• Vocational Testimony  Needed\\nArguments:\\n1.New medical opinion evidence submitted to the Appeals Council documents limitations which\\nwould preclude the ability  to sustain  work activities at any exertional level on a regular and\\ncontinuing  basis, is material, relates to the time period at issue before the AL J, and there is a\\nreasonable probability  that the additional evidence would chang e the outcome of the decision. \\n2.The ALJ erroneously  found that PTSD and depression were not severe impairments and he\\nerred in failing  to include mental limitations in his RF C finding s.\\n  \\n3.The ALJ’s physical RFC finding s are not supported by substantial evidence in the \\nadministrative record.\\n4.The ALJ abused his discretion by failing  to obtain vocational expert testimony  warranting\\nreversal for a new hearing  with VE testimony .  \\n5. The AL J improperly  evaluated obesity , which he found was a severe impairment.\\n6.The ALJ committed legal error by failing  to make any finding s concerning  the vocational effect\\nof absenteeism from frequent medical treatment and/or episodes of increased symptoms on the\\nclaimant’s ability  to sustain work activity  on a regular and continui ng basis, thus warranting\\nreversal and remand. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council noted that the claimant’s treating  physician indicated that the claiman t\\ncontinued to strug gle after his lumbar fusion surgery and additional surgery could be considered;\\nthe record contained several mentions of an abnormal g ait; and evidence showed some slowness\\nto rise with pain from seated to standing  and the use of a cane for assistance. The treating  physician\\nassig ned a permanent impairment rating  of 5% to both legs in addition to his prior 28% impairment\\nto the whole person.  I n finding  the claimant is limited to a reduced rang e of lig ht work, the ALJ\\ndoes not provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of the assessed\\nlimitations. Althoug h the record shows the State agency medical consultants concluded the\\nclaimant could perform light work, the ALJ must still articulate a basis for the RFC finding .  The\\n604\\ndecision also does not adequately  assess the impact of the claimant’s permanent restrictions to his\\nlegs and whole body  and the necessity  of an assistive device in light of the claimant' s reported\\nsymptoms. \\nThe decision finds that lumbar degenerative disc disease is a severe impairment and in accordance\\nwith Acquiescence Ruling  (“AR”) 15-1( 4) (Radford v. Colvin ), when evaluating  whether the\\ncriteria of an impairment in the Listing  of Impairments are met or equaled, the ALJ must determine\\nwhether all the medical criteria in listing  1.04A are present within a continuous 12 month period,\\neven thoug h they  may  not be present simultaneously  or in close prox imity . The decision does not\\nmake this analy sis and further evaluation is warranted.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•further evaluate the claimant’s symptoms, the evidence of record  and the RFC in\\naccordance with our procedures;\\n•when evaluating  whether the criteria of an impairme nt in the Listing  of Impairments are\\nmet or equaled, further consider the claimant' s severe back impairment in accordance with\\nAR 15 -1(4); and\\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a new decision.\\nCaveat: Appeals Council  cited to rescinded AR 15-1( 4) (Radford v.

In reaching  this conclusion, the decision did not adequately  address opinion evidence\\nfrom the State agency  medical consultants, who found that, in addition to other restriction s, the\\nclaimant was limited to standing  and walking  for four hours in an eight-hour workday . Althoug h\\nthe decision assessed the persuasiveness of other portions of these opinions it did not do so for the\\npart pertaining  to standing  and walking .\\nThe decision does not resolve the conflict between the opinions from the State agency medical\\nconsultants and the assessed RFC as required by SSR 96-8p.  Resolution of this conflict is\\nnecessary  because, if correspo nding limitations were included in the assessed RFC, they could\\nadversely  affect the ability  to perform the jobs identified by the ALJ.

Did the Appeals Council appropriately direct the ALJ to consider new evidence submitted regarding the claimant's mental impairment and its impact on her mental residual functional capacity?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ fail to adequately evaluate the claimant's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) under the applicable Listings, and what implications does this have for the overall assessment of the claimant's impairments?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ properly assess the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, particularly in light of the overlapping symptoms with other impairments?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the cumulative effects of the claimant's obesity and other impairments on her overall functional capacity, as required by SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the opinions of the claimant's treating physicians regarding the severity of her impairments and their impact on her ability to work?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ fail to address the potential impact of the claimant's medication side effects on her cognitive functioning and ability to maintain attention, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n11. Did the ALJ err in not obtaining a vocational expert's testimony to clarify the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant's occupational base?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and fatigue, and how did any failures in this regard affect the overall decision?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ's decision to dismiss the claimant's reports of incontinence and its impact on her ability to work constitute a significant error?\\n\\n14.

Consideration should be g iven to this evidence.\\nThe hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the functional impact of the\\nclaimant' s severe medically  determinable impairment of obesity . When obesity  is a severe\\nimpairment, the RFC must include corresponding  limitations pursuant to SSR 96-8p and SSR l9-\\n2p. Althoug h the ALJ found the claimant’s morbid obesity  is a severe impairment, the hearing\\ndecision does not contain any discussion of whether the assessed RFC includes obesity -related\\nlimitations. The hearing  decision found the claimant has the severe impairments of deg enerative\\ndisc disease, diabetes, and hypertension and the non-severe impairments of hernias and obstructive\\nsleep apnea which could be exacerbated by the claimant' s obesity .  The claimant has complained\\nof symptoms which could be associated with obesity  such as constant pain, inability  to sit or stand\\nlong , walk far, bend, or lift, and shortness of breath. Further consideration should be given to the\\nfunctional impact of obesity .\\nThe assessed RFC includes limitatio ns that preclude the performance of the claimant' s past relevant\\nwork (“PRW ”) as a cloth inspector.  The claimant' s RFC limits the claimant to lig ht work with a\\nfurther restriction to \\\"frequent, but not continuous overhead reaching  with her right upper\\nextremity \\\". The vocational expert testified this job was performed at the medium exertional level\\nand that this job would be precluded because he would anticipate overhead reaching  would be more\\nthan frequent. Thus, performance of this job as generally  performed would require ability  that\\nexceeds the limitations set forth in the claimant' s RFC. Further consideration should be given to\\nwhether the claimant has any  PRW  that she can perform.\\nThe Appeals Council further denied the request for review based on the claimant’s contention that\\nthe Social Security  Administration is unconstitutionally  structur ed, finding there was no reason\\nunder its rules to review the AL J’s decision in relation to this contention.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant' s maximum residual functional capacity ,\\nincluding  the functional impact of obesity , during  the entir e period at issue and provide\\nrationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed limitations; \\n•give further consideration to whether the claimant has past relevant work and, if so, can\\nperform it and, if warranted, obtain vocation al expert evidence to assist in evaluating\\nwhether the claimant can perform past relevant work;\\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant' s occupational base.  The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole and before relying on\\nVE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational\\nevidence provided by  the VE and the  Dictionary   of Occupational  Titles (“DOT”); and \\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision.\\n619\\n620\\n621\\n622\\n623\\n624\\n625\\n626\\n627\\n628\\n629\\nLetter Brief #32\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n•  Improper Communication with Third Parties at Telephone Hearing  \\n•  AL J Failure to I nsure Privacy /Lack of Recording  at Telephone Hearing  \\n• AL J Failure to I ntroduce Parties at Telephone Hearing  \\n• AL J Failure to Open Telephone Hearing  with Opening  Statement \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportability  \\n• Retrospective Medical Opinions\\n• Weight of Non-Ex amining  Reviewing  State Ag ency Consultant \\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• AL J Failure to Evaluate Specific Sections of the L isting s\\n• AL J’s Listing  Finding  Lacks Support\\n• Evaluation of Mig raine Headaches\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ improperly  communicated with a third party during  the hearing  and did not follow\\nother procedures. \\n2. Mig raines were not properly  considered pursuant to SSR 19-4p. \\n3. The medical opinion evidence was not properly  evaluated. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed jurisdiction of the case and reman ded the case to address several\\nissues.  \\nFirst, treatment notes from various provider s had been submitted more than five business days\\nbefore the hearing , but were neither exhibited nor consid ered by the ALJ.  Second, the RFC\\nassessment limited the claimant to avoiding  “extreme light” without defining  “extreme” which is\\ntoo broad to provide a precise understanding  of the degree of limitation.  Third, in deciding  that the\\nclaimant did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically  equaled\\nthe severity  of a listed impairment, the ALJ did not evaluate specific sections of the listing s. \\nAdditionally , evaluation of migraines in accordance with Social Security  Ruling  l9-4p is necessary . \\nFinally , the ALJ failed to comply  with HAL LEX I-2-6-50 in conducting  the hearing , which requires\\nthe ALJ to introd uce himself or herself, and any other person who will be assisting  during  the\\nhearing ; explain the reason any person assisting  with the hearing  is present; and identify  any other\\nperson present and explain the person’s reason for being  there. The ALJ also failed to follow\\nHAL LEX I-2-6-52, which requires the ALJ to open a hearing  with a brief statement explaining  how\\nthe hearing  will be conducted, the procedural history  of the claims, and the issues involved, and\\nthe claimant’s representative did not waive a reading  of the issues on the record. Addition ally, \\n630\\nvoices from individuals who do not appear to be parties to the hearing  can be heard on the audio\\nfile making  it unclear if each individual was in a private location during  the hearing .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:  \\n•offer a supplemental hearing  that follows the procedures established in HAL LEX I-2-6-50\\nand HAL LEX I-2-6-52 and if a phone hearing, ensuring  each individual is in a private\\nlocation;\\n• exhibit and consider treatment notes from several providers identified by the Appeals\\nCouncil that were submitted 5 business days prior to the hearing , but were not considered\\nby the AL J;\\n• evaluate whether the claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments that met\\nor medically  equaled the severity  of a listed impairment and evaluate migraine headaches\\nin accordance with Social Security  Ruling  19-4p; \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of\\nthe assessed limitations;  \\n• assig n the case to another AL J, as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n• offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record, and issue a new decision. \\n631\\n632\\n633\\n634\\n635\\n636\\n637\\nLetter Brief #33\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Supportability  Factor\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Consistency  Factor\\n• Weight of Non-Ex amining  Reviewing  State Ag ency Consultant\\n• Improper Reliance on Sing le Decision Maker\\n• Failure to Address Post-Hearing  Objections to Vocational Testimony\\nArguments:\\n1. The ALJ’s decision does not address the opinion of independent rheumatolog ist, Dr. A., who\\nhas experience treating  fibromy algia patients and reviewed the entire record in rendering  his\\nopinion; instead, the decision was based on the improper reliance on a sing le decision maker\\nand the outdated opinion of a non-ex amining  general practitioner.  \\n2. The ALJ did not address timely  submitted post-hearing  objections to vocational testimony ; the\\nevidence provided demonstrates disability  at step five. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council determined that remand was necessary  because the hearing  decision did not\\naddress medical opinion evidence submitted post hearing  and prior to issuance of the hearing\\ndecision by Dr. A.  The ALJ did not address the examining /treating relationship, supportability ,\\nconsistency , specializ ation, or other factors. As Dr. A. opined that the claimant was limited to a\\nrange of sedentary  work, this finding  could result in a disability  finding  for this closely  approaching\\nadvanced ag e claimant. Thus, consideration of the opinion of Dr. A was necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the nontreating  source\\nopinion pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F .R. § 404.1527 and explain the weig ht given\\nto such opinion  evidence. As appropriate, the ALJ may request the nontreating  source\\nprovide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion;\\n•assig n the case to another AL J, as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n•take any further action needed to complete the administrative record and issue a new\\ndecision. \\n638\\n639\\n640\\n641\\n642\\nLetter Brief #34\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportortability  Factor\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Medical Ex pert Testimony  Not Properly  Addressed\\n• RFC - Rig ht Upper Ex tremity  Impairment\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited \\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ failed to mention or address the treating  gastroenterolog ist’s opinion regarding  the\\nclaimant’s limitations prior to the date his insured status ex pired.\\n2.Althoug h the ALJ found the opinion of the testify ing medical expert to be “consistent with the\\nmedical evidence of record, including the treatment records, testimony  at the hearing , and\\nobjective finding s,” the ALJ failed to provide any explanation for not adopting  his opinion that\\nclaimant could only stand/walk for up to two hours a day and would only be able to perform\\noccasional reaching  in all directions (except overhead which was completely  precluded) with\\nthe rig ht dominant upper ex tremity .\\n3.Given the VE’s testimony  that the light occupations she identified would not be available if the\\nclaim ant were limited to only occasional reaching  in all directions with the right dominant\\nupper extremity , the ALJ’s lack of analy sis constituted harmful error. In additio n, the VE\\ntestified there would not be transferable skills to sedentary  work, requiring  a finding  of\\ndisability  under the sedentary  Grids.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed  jurisdiction of the case and remanded the case for further\\nproceeding s. \\nThe hearing  decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of opinion evidence in assessing  the\\nclaimant’s RFC.  The ALJ was required to evaluate this opinion in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520c and explain how the AL J considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  If\\nthe RFC assessment conflicts with an opinion from a medical source, the AL J must ex plain why\\nthe opinion was not adopted in accordance with SSR 96-8p. The ALJ found the opinion of the ME\\nto be persuasive because it was consistent with the medical evidence of record; however, the ME\\nopined that the claimant was limited to standing  or walking  two hours in an 8-hour workday  and\\ncan never reach overhead and occasionally  reach in all other directions with the right upper\\nextremity , limitations that are more restrictive than the RFC.  As the decision did not explain why\\nsuch limitations were not included, further consideration should be given to this opinion evidence. \\n643\\nThe hearing  decision also did not address an assessment from another physician  who opined that\\nthe claimant was more restricted than found by the ALJ.  If the corresponding  limitations were\\nincluded in the assessed RFC, they would adversely  affect the claimant’s ability  to perform the jobs\\nidentified at step five of the sequential evaluatio n, warranting consideration of this opinion\\nevidence. \\nUpon remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinions pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1520c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinions, and may enlist the aid and\\ncooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the claimant’s\\nmedical sources; \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide appropriate\\nrationale with specific references to the evidence of recor d in support of the assessed\\nlimitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base. \\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations establish ed by\\nthe record as a whole.  F urther, before relying on the vocational expert evidence the AL J\\nwill identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the\\nVE and information in the DOT; and \\n•offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing , and take any further action needed to\\ncomplete the administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n644\\n645\\n646\\n647\\n648\\n649\\n650\\n651\\nLetter Brief #35\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Supportability  Factor\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence\\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• AL J’s Duty  to Develop the Record\\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ violated 20 C.F.R. 404.1520c by incorrectly  finding  that the opinions of the claimant’s\\ntreating  therapist, consultative psycholog ist, and ALJ–obtained consultative psycholog ist were\\nnot persuasive and supported by the evidence, especially  as to the period from March 2021 to\\nthe present. As of that date, the record contained no contrary  medical opinions from examining\\nor treating  providers. Third party  statements and testimony  corrob orated claimant’s inability\\nto sustain full time employ ment.\\n2.Given  the ALJ’s determination that the record required a consultative psycholog ical\\nexamination prior to decision, the ALJ’s decision to discount that opini on due to the lack of\\nresponse to a request for clarification that was mailed to the wrong  address was improper and\\nrequires remand. The ALJ further erred in finding  the opinion internally  inconsistent- having\\n“some” ability  to perform certain functions is not inconsistent with having  marked limitations\\nin the ability  to perform such functions.\\n3.The ALJ overstated the extent of claimant’s daily activities and improperly  presumed that the\\nability  to perform activities in a structured safe home setting  equates to being  able to perform\\nthe same level of functioning  outside the home.\\n4.New and material evidence consisting  of a statement from claimant’s mother refutes the ALJ’s\\nfinding s as far as claimant’s ability  to sustain employ ment and regarding claimant’s daily\\nactivities.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council found that the decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of opinion\\nevidence.  The ALJ was required to evaluate opinions in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c,\\n416.920c and explain how the ALJ considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  The\\nAppeals Council found that the ALJ did not specifically  address the consistency  factors or provide\\nany specific citations to the record or medical finding s or reasoning  to support his finding s. Thus,\\non remand “further analy sis of the record should point out where exactly  the inconsistencies are\\nin the record, using  citation to actual medical ex hibits.”\\n \\n652\\nIn addition, the ALJ found that the claimant’s RFC limited the claimant to “low stress work defined\\nas only  occasional decision-making  and only occasional changes in the work setting ; occasional\\ninteraction with coworkers and supervisors; and no interaction, except incidental, with the public.” \\nHowever, this finding  is inconsistent with the opinion of the State Agency psycholog ical\\nconsultants, as well as both treating  and ex amining  (CE) practitioners.  \\nAdditionally , the record was not adequately  developed in assessing  the limiting  effects of the\\nclaimant’s impairments.   The reg ulations g enerally  require that the ag ency  develop a claimant’s\\ncomplete medical history  for at least the 12 months before the claimant filed the application and\\nthe evidentiary  record must be complete and detailed enoug h to determine the nature and severity\\nof the claimant’s impairments.  While a letter was sent to the ALJ-obtained consultative\\npsycholog ist requesting  clarification with respect to the claimant’s functioning , it was sent to the\\nwrong  address and was never receiv ed. Thus, the  ALJ should develop this evidentiary  source\\nbefore determining  persuasiveness or using  the record to support the decisional finding s. \\nThe hearing  decision also does not contain an adequate evaluation of the claimant’s alleg ed\\nsymptoms. In accordance with SSR 16-3p, the decision must contain specific reasons for the weig ht\\ngiven to the individual' s symptoms, be consistent with and supported by the evidence, and be\\nclearly  articulated so the individual and any subsequent reviewer can assess how the adjudicator\\nevaluated the individual’s symptoms.  The ALJ found that the claimant played “interactive and\\nsophisticated video g ames for a couple of hours, and he performed activities of daily  living  such\\nas caring  for his infirm father which include d helping him stand in the shower and use the\\nbathroom.”  However, such activities do not adequately  show functional capacity  for work activity . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant' s mental impairments in order to\\ncomplete the administrative record in accordance with the regulatory  standards regarding\\nconsultative ex aminations and ex isting  medical evidence;\\n \\n•further evaluate the claimant’s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms;  \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.

The ALJ was required to evaluate this opinion in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520c and ex plain how the ALJ considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  If\\nthe RFC assessment conflicts with an opinion from a medical source, the AL J must ex plain why\\nthe opinion was not adopted in accordance with SSR 96-8p.  The ALJ failed to address the opinion\\nof the claimant’s neurosurg eon, who limited the claimant to grasping  for one hour in an 8-hour\\nworkday , whose opinion was consistent with the opinions of three other treating  physicians. As the\\nclaimant’s prior work required frequent handling , if the claimant was limited to occasional\\nhandling , he would be unable to perform his past relevant work and, thus, disabled under Medical-\\nVocational Rule 201.06. \\n \\nThe hearing  decision also did not consider all of the claimant’s medically  determinable\\nimpairments at steps 2 and 3 of the sequential evaluation process and in evaluating  the claimant’s\\nRFC.  Four of the claimant’s treating  physicians opined the claimant had fine and/or gross\\nmanipulative limitations that would impact the claimant’s ability  to perform his past relevant work. \\n \\nFinally , the VE’s testimony  regarding  the reaching requirements of the claimant’s past relevant\\nwork was contradictory  and, thus, the Appeals Council was “unable to discern whether the claimant\\n663\\nis able to perform his past relevant work as a customer order clerk.”  The DOT describes this job\\nas requiring  frequent reaching , while the RFC limited him to occasional reaching  overhead and to\\nchest level with the right upper extremity . Further clarification from a vocational expert to resolve\\nthis inconsistency  is necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•evaluate the evidence of all of the claima nt's medically  determinable impairments to\\ndetermine their severity  and impact, if any, on the claimant’s ability to perform work-\\nrelated activities;\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific refere nces to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source\\nopinion(s) and prior administrative medical finding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R.\\n§ 404.1520c. As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources provide additional\\nevidence and/or further clarification of the opinions and may enlist the aid and cooperation\\nof the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the claimant' s medical\\nsources; \\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base and to determine whether the claimant has\\nacquired any skills that are transferable, with very little, if any, vocational adjustment to\\nother occupations in accordance with SSR 82-41. The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole.  Further, before\\nrelying on the vocational expert evidence the ALJ will identify and resolve any conflicts\\nbetween the occupational evidence provided by  the VE and information in the DOT; and \\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n664\\n665\\n666\\n667\\n668\\n669\\n670\\nLetter Brief #37 \\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Retrospective Medical Opinion \\n• Listing  12.02 Neurocog nitive Disorders \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited\\n• Failure to I ncorporate PRTF  Finding s into Mental RF C\\n• Psychiatric Review Technique - I nconsistent F inding s\\n  \\nArguments:\\n1.New and material evidence from the same medical ex pert who testified at the ALJ hearing  is\\nsubmitted in support of the Request for Review.\\n2.The ALJ erroneously  rejected opinions from claimant’s treating  doctors without a consistency\\nor supportability  analy sis. \\n3.The ALJ erroneously  rejected the opinion of a neuropsy cholog ist, who opined the claimant was\\ndisabled under L isting  12.02.\\n4.The AL J made inconsistent “parag raph B ” finding s.  \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed jurisdiction and again remanded the case to the ALJ for resolution\\nof several issues.   \\nFirst, the Appeals Council found consideration of the new neuropsy cholog ical assessment  evidence\\nwas warranted under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970.   The Appeals Council found the assessment was new,\\nmaterial, and related to the period at issue and there was good cause for not submitting  it previously\\nbecause it did not ex ist at the time the hearing  decision was issued.  Even thoug h the assessment\\nwas dated a year and a half after the claimant’s date last insured, the report referenced “her history\\nof ‘multiple concussions’ and concluded that ‘the presenting  deficits are more likely  to reflect a\\nchronic pattern.’”  \\nThere is also a reasonable probabil ity that the new evidence would chang e the outcome of the\\ndecision.  The Appeals Council noted that at the hearing , the ME was equivocal regarding  whether\\nthe record contained sufficient evidence for her to render an opinion, but based on her review of\\nthe record, she concluded that a neurocog nitive disorder was not established; an opinion the ALJ\\nfound persuasive. Because the finding s and impressions contained in the neuropsy cholog ical\\nassessment undermine the ME testimony  on which the ALJ relied, evaluation of the new evidence\\nis warranted.\\n671\\nAdditionally , the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the medical source\\nopinions and prior administrative medical finding s. The Appeals Council noted that two treating\\nphysicians submitted generally  consistent opinions which the ALJ found unpersuasive, reasoning\\nthat they offered vocational opinions outside of their areas of expertise and did not provide\\nfunction-by -functio n assessments of the claimant’s limitations and their opinions were not\\nsupported by treatment notes. However, the Appeals Council noted one opinion found claimant\\nmoderately  or markedly  limited in several areas of basic mental work-related functioning , which\\nthe ALJ did not address, and also cited treatment notes documenting  finding s of diminished short-\\nterm memory . According ly, the ALJ’s rationale for discounting  the opinions was not substantially\\nsupported, warranting  further evaluation of the medical source opinions and prior administrative\\nmedical finding s. \\nFinally , the hearing  decision is not based on all of the relevant evidence. The claimant filed a\\nsubsequent application for SSDI  and in its prior remand order, the Appeals Council directed the\\nALJ to consolidate the claims files, associate the evidence, and issue a new decision on the\\nconsolidated claims. However, the evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent\\napplication was not associated with the record and exhibited and considered in issuing  the\\nunderly ing hearing  decision. Consideration of this evidence is therefore necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•associate and consider the evidence submitted in conne ction with the subsequent\\napplication for SSDI ; \\n•evaluate the additional evidence submitted, consistent with 20 C.F .R. § 404.970;\\n•give further consideration lo the medical source opinions and prior administrative medical\\nfinding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may\\nrequest the medical sources provide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the\\nopinions and the ALJ may enlist the aid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative\\nin developing  evidence from the claimant' s medical sources; \\n•as warranted, give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide\\nappropriate rationale with specif ic references to evidence of record in support of the\\nassessed limitations;  \\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.\\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations established by\\nthe record as a whole.  F urther, before rely ing on the vocational expert evidence the AL J\\nwill identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the\\nVE and information in the DOT; \\n•as this case was previously  remanded to the same ALJ, the Appeals Council directs that,\\nupon remand, this case be assig ned to another AL J; and\\n•the ALJ will take any further action needed to complete the administrative record and issue\\na new decision. \\n672\\n673\\n674\\n675\\n676\\n677\\n678\\n679\\n680\\n Letter Brief #38\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Severity  – Mental I mpairment \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in the Record\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence \\n• Evaluation of Mig raine Headaches\\n• Sig nificant Number of J obs\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ’s RFC finding  is internally  inconsistent and would provide for claimant to be off task\\nover 20% of the time instead of the 8% indicated, an off task amount which the vocational\\nexpert testified would be preclusive of all work.\\n2. The ALJ failed to obtain vocational testimony  and opinions at Step 5 based on his RFC finding\\nas the ALJ failed to include all the RFC limits in the hypothetical or the CE’s limit of 4 hours\\nsitting  per day, and the CE' s opinion about whether a person can work sitting  no more than 4\\nhours a day and standing  no more than 4 hours per day, or walking  no more than 1 hour per day\\nwith a sit/stand option is not a substitute for vocational testimony  on the subject.\\n3. There were not a substantial number of jobs in the state or region of the jobs identified by the\\nVE and used by  the AL J.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe ALJ found the opinion of the consultative examiner was “somewhat persuasive.”  However,\\nthe CE found that the claimant was limited to sitting  for a total of four hours in an 8-hour workday ;\\na finding  inconsi stent with the ALJ’s finding  that claimant could perform sedentary  work.  The\\nAppeals Council noted that a full rang e of sedentary  work allows for standing  two hours in an 8-\\nhour workday  and sitting  a total of six hours in an 8-hour workday  in accordance with SSR 96-9p. \\nThe Appe als Council also found the decision does not provide an adequate symptom evaluation\\nin accordance with SSR 16-3p.  While the decision lists the seven factors used when evaluating  the\\nintensity , persistence, and limiting effects of an individual’s symptoms, it does “not appear that\\nthey were considered or evaluated in the decision.”  These seven factors are: (1) daily  activities;\\n(2) duration, frequency , and intensity  of pain and other symptoms; (3) precipitating  and aggravating\\nfactors; (4) the type, dosag e, effectiveness, and side effects of medication; (5) treatment other than\\nmedication; (6) other measures used to relieve symptoms; and (7) other factors related to the\\nclaimant’s functional limitations and restrictions.  \\nFinally , while the decision does consider that the claimant failed to follow throug h on prescribed\\nphysical therapy , SSR 16-3p states SSA will not find an individual’s symptoms inconsistent with\\nthe evidence in the recor d on this basis without considering  possible reasons he or she may not\\ncomply  with treatment or seek treatment consistent with the degree of his or her complaints.  In this\\n681\\ncase the decision states, “[i]t does not appear providers suggested invasive therapy , such as surgery,\\nor even injections, and the claimant failed to follow throug h on prescrib ed physical therapy ,\\npossibly  content with her treatment regimen, to which she attributed pain relief and increased\\nfunctionality ,” a finding  which does not provide adequate consideration of possible reasons she did\\nnot follow throug h with phy sical therapy . \\n \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•further evaluate the claimant’s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms; \\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinion(s) pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1520c and, as appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical source to provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion; \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed\\nlimitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source opinion(s) pursuant to the provisions\\nof 20 CFR 404.1520c. As appro priate, the ALJ may request the medical source provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion; \\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.\\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect  the specific capacity /limitations established by\\nthe record as a whole.  The ALJ will ask the vocational expert to identify  examples of\\nappropriate jobs and to state the incidence of such jobs in the national economy  Further,\\nbefore relying on the vocational expert evidence the ALJ will identif y and resolve any\\nconflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the VE and information in the\\nDOT; \\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a new decision. \\n682\\n683\\n684\\n685\\n686\\n687\\n688\\n689\\nLetter Brief #39\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence\\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited\\n• RFC – Time Off Task \\n• Unsupported RF C \\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• Failure to  F ollow Prescribed Treatment – AL J Duty  to Inquire About Reasons\\n• Sig nificant Number of J obs\\n• Reliance on Obsolete J obs\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.The AL J ignored medical opinions relevant to the period at issue.\\n2.The AL J “considered the increase in headaches and migraines” in assessing  claimant’s RF C,\\nbut she supplied no RFC limitations to accommodate headache triggers and did not explain\\ntheir absence.\\n3.The AL J ignored two reports from claimant’s mother.   \\n4.The AL J did not address the inconsistent numbers of available jobs at Step F ive. \\n5.New and material evidence further supports claimant’s Child’s Disability  Benefits claim. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council affirmed the AL J’s decision finding  claimant disabled beg inning  April 24,\\n2020, but vacated the decision with respect to the issue of disability  before March 23, 2017, when\\nthe claimant turned age 22. At step 2, the ALJ found no medically  determinable mental impairment\\nas of age 22.  However, the ALJ failed to address the persuasiveness of an evaluation  that was\\nconsistent with claimant’s longstanding  history  since her childhood of poor concentra tion, memory,\\ndistractibility , and difficulties with time manag ement.  Under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520c, the ALJ was\\nrequired to articulate the persuasiveness all of the medical opinions and all of the prior\\nadministrative medical finding s in the case record.   \\nIn assessi ng RFC, the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate consideration of evidence\\nfrom the claimant’s mother, who noted significa nt symptoms and challeng es since claimant’s\\ndecompression surgery.  Under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a)(3), 416.945(a)(3), the ALJ was required\\nto consider all relevant medical and other evidence in assessing  the claimant’s RF C.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinions pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c, 416.920c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources\\n690\\nprovide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinions, and may enlist the\\naid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the\\nclaimant’s medical sources. In doing so, clarify  whether opinions reflect the claimant’s\\ncondition as of March 23, 2017;\\n•further evaluate the claimant’s mental impairments in accordance with the special\\ntechnique described in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a, documenting  application of the\\ntechnique in the decision by providing  specific finding s and appropriate rationale for each\\nof the functional areas;   \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide appropriate\\nrationale with specific reference s to evidence of record in support of the assessed\\nlimitations; and\\n•offer the claimant opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete the\\nadministrative record and issue a new decision on the issue of disability  on or before March\\n23, 2017. \\nCaveat: EM-24027, effective June 22, 2024, clarifies and consolidates guidance related to eviden-\\ntiary support required before relying on certain obsolete occupations to find a claimant “not\\ndisabled” using the Grids.   \\n691\\n692\\n693\\n694\\n695\\n696\\n697\\n698\\nLetter Brief #40\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Medical Ex pert Testimony  Not Addressed \\n• Failure to I ncorporate PRTF  Finding s into Mental RF C\\n• Past Relevant W ork – Not SGA \\n• Past Relevant W ork – Not W orked L ong Enoug h to L earn the J ob\\n• Skill L evel of Past Work\\n• Duty  to Develop the Mental and Phy sical Demands of Past W ork  \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportability  Factor\\n• Subpoena – AL J’s Failure to Notify  and Provide Rationale for Denial of Request\\n• VE Qualifications\\nArguments:\\n1.Medical Ex pert (ME) testified claimant met L isting s 12.04 &  12.06.\\n2.HAL LEX I-2-5-78(D) (Deny ing a Subpoena Request) was not followed. \\n3.

Failure to comply  with Security  Ruling  96-8p. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe  Appeals Council noted that while the ALJ found the claimant’s bipolar disorder and general\\nanxiety disorder were severe with a mild limitations in understanding , remembering  or applying\\ninformation and interacting  with others and moderate limitations in concentrating , persisting  or\\nmaintaining  pace and adapting  or manag ing oneself, this “B” criteria evaluation is inconsistent with\\nthe RFC finding  that claimant could perform a full range of work at all exertional levels except\\nfast-paced production work.  Specifically , the RFC did not address the level of work that claimant\\ncould perform imposed by  moderate limitations in adapting  or manag ing oneself. \\nThe Appeals Council found that in rejecting  the opinion s of the consultative examiner and the\\nclaimant’s social worker regarding  the claimant’s mental limitations, the ALJ did not provide\\nsufficient rationale with specific references to the evidence of record to explain why these opinions\\nwere not supported.  In addition, the ALJ found that the claimant is capable of performing  her past\\nrelevant work as an interior designer, which the Appeals Council noted is described in the DOT\\nas skilled light work (SVP 7).  The Appeals Council found unclear whether the claimant would be\\nable to perform this work with these possible mental work-related limitations, thus finding  further\\nevaluation of the severity  of the claimant’s mental impairments necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n699\\n•if warranted and necessa ry, obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s mental\\nimpairments in order to complete the administrative record in accordance with the\\nregulatory  standards regarding  consultative ex aminations and ex isting  medical evidence. \\nThe ALJ may enlist the aid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing\\nevidence from the claimant’s treating  sources. \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support\\nof the assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source opinions and prior\\nadministrative medical finding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R. 416.920c. As\\nappropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources to provide additional evidence and/or\\nfurther clarification of the opinions. \\n•obtain vocational evidence sufficient to allow a comparison between the claimant’s residual\\nfunctional capacity  and the mental and physical demands of her past relevant work.  If\\nconsideratio n is given to step five of the sequential evaluation, the ALJ will obtain\\nsupplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base. The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity / limitations established by the record as a whole.  The ALJ will ask\\nthe vocational expert to identify  examples of appropriate jobs and to state the incidence of\\nsuch jobs in the national economy  Further, before relying on the vocational expert evidence\\nthe ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided\\nby the VE and information in the DOT; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n \\n \\n700\\n701\\n702\\n703\\n704\\n705\\n706\\n707\\n708\\n \\nORDER FORMName: ___________________________________________ Firm______________________________________________\\nAddress: ____________________________________________________________________ Tel: (_____)_____________\\nCity, State, Zip: ___________________________________________________  Email:_____________________________\\nPlease return the order form, with your check, payable to Sarah H.

      "  \"prev_response\": \"Here is a refined set of 20 questions based on the provided context, ensuring clarity and specificity while addressing the potential errors made by the ALJ in evaluating the claimant's various impairments:\\n\\n1. Did the ALJ adequately recognize that the pulmonary function studies documented the claimant's respiratory impairment as meeting the requirements of Listing 3.02A, and how did this oversight impact the disability determination?\\n\\n2. Did the ALJ's contradictory findings regarding the severity of the claimant's depression warrant remand, particularly given the reliance on an outdated opinion from the State agency psychological consultant?\\n\\n3. Did the ALJ err in relying on past work performed outside the 15-year period, thus rendering the past work finding unsustainable?\\n\\n4. Did the Appeals Council correctly identify the need for a consultative pulmonary examination and updated pulmonary testing to assess the severity of the claimant's pulmonary impairment?\\n\\n5. Did the Appeals Council appropriately direct the ALJ to consider new evidence submitted regarding the claimant's mental impairment and its impact on her mental residual functional capacity?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ fail to adequately evaluate the claimant's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) under the applicable Listings, and what implications does this have for the overall assessment of the claimant's impairments?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ properly assess the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, particularly in light of the overlapping symptoms with other impairments?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the cumulative effects of the claimant's obesity and other impairments on her overall functional capacity, as required by SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the opinions of the claimant's treating physicians regarding the severity of her impairments and their impact on her ability to work?\\n\\n10.

Did the Appeals Council's findings regarding the need for further evaluation of the claimant's impairments and the potential for a new hearing adequately address the deficiencies in the ALJ's decision? \\n\\nThis refined set of questions maintains a focus on the specific legal standards and guidelines relevant to the evaluation of the claimant's impairments while ensuring clarity and precision.. Refine these questions and ensure the final set contains exactly 20 questions based on the following additional context: hearing  decision or any  other work. Consideration should be g iven to this evidence.\\nThe hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the functional impact of the\\nclaimant' s severe medically  determinable impairment of obesity . When obesity  is a severe\\nimpairment, the RFC must include corresponding  limitations pursuant to SSR 96-8p and SSR l9-\\n2p. Althoug h the ALJ found the claimant’s morbid obesity  is a severe impairment, the hearing\\ndecision does not contain any discussion of whether the assessed RFC includes obesity -related\\nlimitations. The hearing  decision found the claimant has the severe impairments of deg enerative\\ndisc disease, diabetes, and hypertension and the non-severe impairments of hernias and obstructive\\nsleep apnea which could be exacerbated by the claimant' s obesity .  The claimant has complained\\nof symptoms which could be associated with obesity  such as constant pain, inability  to sit or stand\\nlong , walk far, bend, or lift, and shortness of breath. Further consideration should be given to the\\nfunctional impact of obesity .\\nThe assessed RFC includes limitatio ns that preclude the performance of the claimant' s past relevant\\nwork (“PRW ”) as a cloth inspector.  The claimant' s RFC limits the claimant to lig ht work with a\\nfurther restriction to \\\"frequent, but not continuous overhead reaching  with her right upper\\nextremity \\\". The vocational expert testified this job was performed at the medium exertional level\\nand that this job would be precluded because he would anticipate overhead reaching  would be more\\nthan frequent. Thus, performance of this job as generally  performed would require ability  that\\nexceeds the limitations set forth in the claimant' s RFC. Further consideration should be given to\\nwhether the claimant has any  PRW  that she can perform.\\nThe Appeals Council further denied the request for review based on the claimant’s contention that\\nthe Social Security  Administration is unconstitutionally  structur ed, finding there was no reason\\nunder its rules to review the AL J’s decision in relation to this contention.\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the claimant' s maximum residual functional capacity ,\\nincluding  the functional impact of obesity , during  the entir e period at issue and provide\\nrationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed limitations; \\n•give further consideration to whether the claimant has past relevant work and, if so, can\\nperform it and, if warranted, obtain vocation al expert evidence to assist in evaluating\\nwhether the claimant can perform past relevant work;\\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant' s occupational base.  The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole and before relying on\\nVE evidence, the ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational\\nevidence provided by  the VE and the  Dictionary   of Occupational  Titles (“DOT”); and \\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision.\\n619\\n620\\n621\\n622\\n623\\n624\\n625\\n626\\n627\\n628\\n629\\nLetter Brief #32\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n•  Improper Communication with Third Parties at Telephone Hearing  \\n•  AL J Failure to I nsure Privacy /Lack of Recording  at Telephone Hearing  \\n• AL J Failure to I ntroduce Parties at Telephone Hearing  \\n• AL J Failure to Open Telephone Hearing  with Opening  Statement \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportability  \\n• Retrospective Medical Opinions\\n• Weight of Non-Ex amining  Reviewing  State Ag ency Consultant \\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• AL J Failure to Evaluate Specific Sections of the L isting s\\n• AL J’s Listing  Finding  Lacks Support\\n• Evaluation of Mig raine Headaches\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ improperly  communicated with a third party during  the hearing  and did not follow\\nother procedures. \\n2. Mig raines were not properly  considered pursuant to SSR 19-4p. \\n3. The medical opinion evidence was not properly  evaluated. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed jurisdiction of the case and reman ded the case to address several\\nissues.  \\nFirst, treatment notes from various provider s had been submitted more than five business days\\nbefore the hearing , but were neither exhibited nor consid ered by the ALJ.  Second, the RFC\\nassessment limited the claimant to avoiding  “extreme light” without defining  “extreme” which is\\ntoo broad to provide a precise understanding  of the degree of limitation.  Third, in deciding  that the\\nclaimant did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically  equaled\\nthe severity  of a listed impairment, the ALJ did not evaluate specific sections of the listing s. \\nAdditionally , evaluation of migraines in accordance with Social Security  Ruling  l9-4p is necessary . \\nFinally , the ALJ failed to comply  with HAL LEX I-2-6-50 in conducting  the hearing , which requires\\nthe ALJ to introd uce himself or herself, and any other person who will be assisting  during  the\\nhearing ; explain the reason any person assisting  with the hearing  is present; and identify  any other\\nperson present and explain the person’s reason for being  there. The ALJ also failed to follow\\nHAL LEX I-2-6-52, which requires the ALJ to open a hearing  with a brief statement explaining  how\\nthe hearing  will be conducted, the procedural history  of the claims, and the issues involved, and\\nthe claimant’s representative did not waive a reading  of the issues on the record. Addition ally, \\n630\\nvoices from individuals who do not appear to be parties to the hearing  can be heard on the audio\\nfile making  it unclear if each individual was in a private location during  the hearing .\\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:  \\n•offer a supplemental hearing  that follows the procedures established in HAL LEX I-2-6-50\\nand HAL LEX I-2-6-52 and if a phone hearing, ensuring  each individual is in a private\\nlocation;\\n• exhibit and consider treatment notes from several providers identified by the Appeals\\nCouncil that were submitted 5 business days prior to the hearing , but were not considered\\nby the AL J;\\n• evaluate whether the claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments that met\\nor medically  equaled the severity  of a listed impairment and evaluate migraine headaches\\nin accordance with Social Security  Ruling  19-4p; \\n• give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity and\\nprovide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of\\nthe assessed limitations;  \\n• assig n the case to another AL J, as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n• offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record, and issue a new decision. \\n631\\n632\\n633\\n634\\n635\\n636\\n637\\nLetter Brief #33\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Supportability  Factor\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Consistency  Factor\\n• Weight of Non-Ex amining  Reviewing  State Ag ency Consultant\\n• Improper Reliance on Sing le Decision Maker\\n• Failure to Address Post-Hearing  Objections to Vocational Testimony\\nArguments:\\n1. The ALJ’s decision does not address the opinion of independent rheumatolog ist, Dr. A., who\\nhas experience treating  fibromy algia patients and reviewed the entire record in rendering  his\\nopinion; instead, the decision was based on the improper reliance on a sing le decision maker\\nand the outdated opinion of a non-ex amining  general practitioner.  \\n2. The ALJ did not address timely  submitted post-hearing  objections to vocational testimony ; the\\nevidence provided demonstrates disability  at step five. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council determined that remand was necessary  because the hearing  decision did not\\naddress medical opinion evidence submitted post hearing  and prior to issuance of the hearing\\ndecision by Dr. A.  The ALJ did not address the examining /treating relationship, supportability ,\\nconsistency , specializ ation, or other factors. As Dr. A. opined that the claimant was limited to a\\nrange of sedentary  work, this finding  could result in a disability  finding  for this closely  approaching\\nadvanced ag e claimant. Thus, consideration of the opinion of Dr. A was necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council directed that on remand, the AL J will: \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the nontreating  source\\nopinion pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F .R. § 404.1527 and explain the weig ht given\\nto such opinion  evidence. As appropriate, the ALJ may request the nontreating  source\\nprovide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion;\\n•assig n the case to another AL J, as it was previously  assig ned to the same AL J;\\n•take any further action needed to complete the administrative record and issue a new\\ndecision. \\n638\\n639\\n640\\n641\\n642\\nLetter Brief #34\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportortability  Factor\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Medical Ex pert Testimony  Not Properly  Addressed\\n• RFC - Rig ht Upper Ex tremity  Impairment\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited \\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ failed to mention or address the treating  gastroenterolog ist’s opinion regarding  the\\nclaimant’s limitations prior to the date his insured status ex pired.\\n2.Althoug h the ALJ found the opinion of the testify ing medical expert to be “consistent with the\\nmedical evidence of record, including the treatment records, testimony  at the hearing , and\\nobjective finding s,” the ALJ failed to provide any explanation for not adopting  his opinion that\\nclaimant could only stand/walk for up to two hours a day and would only be able to perform\\noccasional reaching  in all directions (except overhead which was completely  precluded) with\\nthe rig ht dominant upper ex tremity .\\n3.Given the VE’s testimony  that the light occupations she identified would not be available if the\\nclaim ant were limited to only occasional reaching  in all directions with the right dominant\\nupper extremity , the ALJ’s lack of analy sis constituted harmful error. In additio n, the VE\\ntestified there would not be transferable skills to sedentary  work, requiring  a finding  of\\ndisability  under the sedentary  Grids.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed  jurisdiction of the case and remanded the case for further\\nproceeding s. \\nThe hearing  decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of opinion evidence in assessing  the\\nclaimant’s RFC.  The ALJ was required to evaluate this opinion in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520c and explain how the AL J considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  If\\nthe RFC assessment conflicts with an opinion from a medical source, the AL J must ex plain why\\nthe opinion was not adopted in accordance with SSR 96-8p. The ALJ found the opinion of the ME\\nto be persuasive because it was consistent with the medical evidence of record; however, the ME\\nopined that the claimant was limited to standing  or walking  two hours in an 8-hour workday  and\\ncan never reach overhead and occasionally  reach in all other directions with the right upper\\nextremity , limitations that are more restrictive than the RFC.  As the decision did not explain why\\nsuch limitations were not included, further consideration should be given to this opinion evidence. \\n643\\nThe hearing  decision also did not address an assessment from another physician  who opined that\\nthe claimant was more restricted than found by the ALJ.  If the corresponding  limitations were\\nincluded in the assessed RFC, they would adversely  affect the claimant’s ability  to perform the jobs\\nidentified at step five of the sequential evaluatio n, warranting consideration of this opinion\\nevidence. \\nUpon remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinions pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1520c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinions, and may enlist the aid and\\ncooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the claimant’s\\nmedical sources; \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide appropriate\\nrationale with specific references to the evidence of recor d in support of the assessed\\nlimitations;\\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base. \\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations establish ed by\\nthe record as a whole.  F urther, before relying on the vocational expert evidence the AL J\\nwill identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the\\nVE and information in the DOT; and \\n•offer the claimant the opportunity  for a hearing , and take any further action needed to\\ncomplete the administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n644\\n645\\n646\\n647\\n648\\n649\\n650\\n651\\nLetter Brief #35\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Supportability  Factor\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in Record\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence\\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• AL J’s Duty  to Develop the Record\\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ violated 20 C.F.R. 404.1520c by incorrectly  finding  that the opinions of the claimant’s\\ntreating  therapist, consultative psycholog ist, and ALJ–obtained consultative psycholog ist were\\nnot persuasive and supported by the evidence, especially  as to the period from March 2021 to\\nthe present. As of that date, the record contained no contrary  medical opinions from examining\\nor treating  providers. Third party  statements and testimony  corrob orated claimant’s inability\\nto sustain full time employ ment.\\n2.Given  the ALJ’s determination that the record required a consultative psycholog ical\\nexamination prior to decision, the ALJ’s decision to discount that opini on due to the lack of\\nresponse to a request for clarification that was mailed to the wrong  address was improper and\\nrequires remand. The ALJ further erred in finding  the opinion internally  inconsistent- having\\n“some” ability  to perform certain functions is not inconsistent with having  marked limitations\\nin the ability  to perform such functions.\\n3.The ALJ overstated the extent of claimant’s daily activities and improperly  presumed that the\\nability  to perform activities in a structured safe home setting  equates to being  able to perform\\nthe same level of functioning  outside the home.\\n4.New and material evidence consisting  of a statement from claimant’s mother refutes the ALJ’s\\nfinding s as far as claimant’s ability  to sustain employ ment and regarding claimant’s daily\\nactivities.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council found that the decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of opinion\\nevidence.  The ALJ was required to evaluate opinions in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520c,\\n416.920c and explain how the ALJ considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  The\\nAppeals Council found that the ALJ did not specifically  address the consistency  factors or provide\\nany specific citations to the record or medical finding s or reasoning  to support his finding s. Thus,\\non remand “further analy sis of the record should point out where exactly  the inconsistencies are\\nin the record, using  citation to actual medical ex hibits.”\\n \\n652\\nIn addition, the ALJ found that the claimant’s RFC limited the claimant to “low stress work defined\\nas only  occasional decision-making  and only occasional changes in the work setting ; occasional\\ninteraction with coworkers and supervisors; and no interaction, except incidental, with the public.” \\nHowever, this finding  is inconsistent with the opinion of the State Agency psycholog ical\\nconsultants, as well as both treating  and ex amining  (CE) practitioners.  \\nAdditionally , the record was not adequately  developed in assessing  the limiting  effects of the\\nclaimant’s impairments.   The reg ulations g enerally  require that the ag ency  develop a claimant’s\\ncomplete medical history  for at least the 12 months before the claimant filed the application and\\nthe evidentiary  record must be complete and detailed enoug h to determine the nature and severity\\nof the claimant’s impairments.  While a letter was sent to the ALJ-obtained consultative\\npsycholog ist requesting  clarification with respect to the claimant’s functioning , it was sent to the\\nwrong  address and was never receiv ed. Thus, the  ALJ should develop this evidentiary  source\\nbefore determining  persuasiveness or using  the record to support the decisional finding s. \\nThe hearing  decision also does not contain an adequate evaluation of the claimant’s alleg ed\\nsymptoms. In accordance with SSR 16-3p, the decision must contain specific reasons for the weig ht\\ngiven to the individual' s symptoms, be consistent with and supported by the evidence, and be\\nclearly  articulated so the individual and any subsequent reviewer can assess how the adjudicator\\nevaluated the individual’s symptoms.  The ALJ found that the claimant played “interactive and\\nsophisticated video g ames for a couple of hours, and he performed activities of daily  living  such\\nas caring  for his infirm father which include d helping him stand in the shower and use the\\nbathroom.”  However, such activities do not adequately  show functional capacity  for work activity . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant' s mental impairments in order to\\ncomplete the administrative record in accordance with the regulatory  standards regarding\\nconsultative ex aminations and ex isting  medical evidence;\\n \\n•further evaluate the claimant’s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms;  \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific references to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source\\nopinion(s ) and prior administrative medical finding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.1520c and 416.920c. As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical source\\nprovide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion;  \\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a new decision. \\n653\\n654\\n655\\n656\\n657\\n658\\n659\\n660\\n661\\n662\\nLetter Brief #36 \\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Unsupported RF C\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Supportability  Factor\\n• Weight of Medical Source Opinion – Consistency  Factor\\n• Severity  - RF C Failed to Account for All Severe I mpairments \\n• RFC - Rig ht Upper Ex tremity  Impairment\\n• Evaluation of Past Relevant W ork \\n• Past Relevant W ork – W ork Subsidies\\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• Musculoskeletal I mpairments – Epicondy litis/Ulnar Neuropathy\\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ offered no explanation for her decision to discount claimant’s subjective symptom\\nalleg ations.\\n2.The ALJ failed to reach a finding  regarding  the severity  of claimant’s right-sided epicondy litis\\nand rig ht ulnar neuropathy .\\n3.The AL J’s RF C assessment is incomplete.\\n4.The AL J erred in rejecting  the consistent opinions of three treating  sources. \\n5.The AL J's Step F our finding  is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe hearing  decision did not contain an adequate evaluation of opinion evidence in assessing  the\\nclaimant’s RFC.  The ALJ was required to evaluate this opinion in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520c and ex plain how the ALJ considered the factors of supportability  and consistency .  If\\nthe RFC assessment conflicts with an opinion from a medical source, the AL J must ex plain why\\nthe opinion was not adopted in accordance with SSR 96-8p.  The ALJ failed to address the opinion\\nof the claimant’s neurosurg eon, who limited the claimant to grasping  for one hour in an 8-hour\\nworkday , whose opinion was consistent with the opinions of three other treating  physicians. As the\\nclaimant’s prior work required frequent handling , if the claimant was limited to occasional\\nhandling , he would be unable to perform his past relevant work and, thus, disabled under Medical-\\nVocational Rule 201.06. \\n \\nThe hearing  decision also did not consider all of the claimant’s medically  determinable\\nimpairments at steps 2 and 3 of the sequential evaluation process and in evaluating  the claimant’s\\nRFC.  Four of the claimant’s treating  physicians opined the claimant had fine and/or gross\\nmanipulative limitations that would impact the claimant’s ability  to perform his past relevant work. \\n \\nFinally , the VE’s testimony  regarding  the reaching requirements of the claimant’s past relevant\\nwork was contradictory  and, thus, the Appeals Council was “unable to discern whether the claimant\\n663\\nis able to perform his past relevant work as a customer order clerk.”  The DOT describes this job\\nas requiring  frequent reaching , while the RFC limited him to occasional reaching  overhead and to\\nchest level with the right upper extremity . Further clarification from a vocational expert to resolve\\nthis inconsistency  is necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•evaluate the evidence of all of the claima nt's medically  determinable impairments to\\ndetermine their severity  and impact, if any, on the claimant’s ability to perform work-\\nrelated activities;\\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum residual functional capacity  during\\nthe entire period at issue and provide rationale with specific refere nces to evidence of\\nrecord in support of assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source\\nopinion(s) and prior administrative medical finding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R.\\n§ 404.1520c. As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources provide additional\\nevidence and/or further clarification of the opinions and may enlist the aid and cooperation\\nof the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the claimant' s medical\\nsources; \\n•obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base and to determine whether the claimant has\\nacquired any skills that are transferable, with very little, if any, vocational adjustment to\\nother occupations in accordance with SSR 82-41. The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity /limitations established by the record as a whole.  Further, before\\nrelying on the vocational expert evidence the ALJ will identify and resolve any conflicts\\nbetween the occupational evidence provided by  the VE and information in the DOT; and \\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n664\\n665\\n666\\n667\\n668\\n669\\n670\\nLetter Brief #37 \\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions\\n• Retrospective Medical Opinion \\n• Listing  12.02 Neurocog nitive Disorders \\n• Evidence Not Mentioned or Ex hibited\\n• Failure to I ncorporate PRTF  Finding s into Mental RF C\\n• Psychiatric Review Technique - I nconsistent F inding s\\n  \\nArguments:\\n1.New and material evidence from the same medical ex pert who testified at the ALJ hearing  is\\nsubmitted in support of the Request for Review.\\n2.The ALJ erroneously  rejected opinions from claimant’s treating  doctors without a consistency\\nor supportability  analy sis. \\n3.The ALJ erroneously  rejected the opinion of a neuropsy cholog ist, who opined the claimant was\\ndisabled under L isting  12.02.\\n4.The AL J made inconsistent “parag raph B ” finding s.  \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nFollowing  court remand, the ALJ again denied the claim and the claimant submitted Exceptions. \\nThe Appeals Council assumed jurisdiction and again remanded the case to the ALJ for resolution\\nof several issues.   \\nFirst, the Appeals Council found consideration of the new neuropsy cholog ical assessment  evidence\\nwas warranted under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970.   The Appeals Council found the assessment was new,\\nmaterial, and related to the period at issue and there was good cause for not submitting  it previously\\nbecause it did not ex ist at the time the hearing  decision was issued.  Even thoug h the assessment\\nwas dated a year and a half after the claimant’s date last insured, the report referenced “her history\\nof ‘multiple concussions’ and concluded that ‘the presenting  deficits are more likely  to reflect a\\nchronic pattern.’”  \\nThere is also a reasonable probabil ity that the new evidence would chang e the outcome of the\\ndecision.  The Appeals Council noted that at the hearing , the ME was equivocal regarding  whether\\nthe record contained sufficient evidence for her to render an opinion, but based on her review of\\nthe record, she concluded that a neurocog nitive disorder was not established; an opinion the ALJ\\nfound persuasive. Because the finding s and impressions contained in the neuropsy cholog ical\\nassessment undermine the ME testimony  on which the ALJ relied, evaluation of the new evidence\\nis warranted.\\n671\\nAdditionally , the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate evaluation of the medical source\\nopinions and prior administrative medical finding s. The Appeals Council noted that two treating\\nphysicians submitted generally  consistent opinions which the ALJ found unpersuasive, reasoning\\nthat they offered vocational opinions outside of their areas of expertise and did not provide\\nfunction-by -functio n assessments of the claimant’s limitations and their opinions were not\\nsupported by treatment notes. However, the Appeals Council noted one opinion found claimant\\nmoderately  or markedly  limited in several areas of basic mental work-related functioning , which\\nthe ALJ did not address, and also cited treatment notes documenting  finding s of diminished short-\\nterm memory . According ly, the ALJ’s rationale for discounting  the opinions was not substantially\\nsupported, warranting  further evaluation of the medical source opinions and prior administrative\\nmedical finding s. \\nFinally , the hearing  decision is not based on all of the relevant evidence. The claimant filed a\\nsubsequent application for SSDI  and in its prior remand order, the Appeals Council directed the\\nALJ to consolidate the claims files, associate the evidence, and issue a new decision on the\\nconsolidated claims. However, the evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent\\napplication was not associated with the record and exhibited and considered in issuing  the\\nunderly ing hearing  decision. Consideration of this evidence is therefore necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•associate and consider the evidence submitted in conne ction with the subsequent\\napplication for SSDI ; \\n•evaluate the additional evidence submitted, consistent with 20 C.F .R. § 404.970;\\n•give further consideration lo the medical source opinions and prior administrative medical\\nfinding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may\\nrequest the medical sources provide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the\\nopinions and the ALJ may enlist the aid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative\\nin developing  evidence from the claimant' s medical sources; \\n•as warranted, give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide\\nappropriate rationale with specif ic references to evidence of record in support of the\\nassessed limitations;  \\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.\\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect the specific capacity /limitations established by\\nthe record as a whole.  F urther, before rely ing on the vocational expert evidence the AL J\\nwill identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the\\nVE and information in the DOT; \\n•as this case was previously  remanded to the same ALJ, the Appeals Council directs that,\\nupon remand, this case be assig ned to another AL J; and\\n•the ALJ will take any further action needed to complete the administrative record and issue\\na new decision. \\n672\\n673\\n674\\n675\\n676\\n677\\n678\\n679\\n680\\n Letter Brief #38\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Severity  – Mental I mpairment \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions \\n• Failure to Address Evidence in the Record\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence \\n• Evaluation of Mig raine Headaches\\n• Sig nificant Number of J obs\\n• New Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council\\nArguments:\\n1.The ALJ’s RFC finding  is internally  inconsistent and would provide for claimant to be off task\\nover 20% of the time instead of the 8% indicated, an off task amount which the vocational\\nexpert testified would be preclusive of all work.\\n2. The ALJ failed to obtain vocational testimony  and opinions at Step 5 based on his RFC finding\\nas the ALJ failed to include all the RFC limits in the hypothetical or the CE’s limit of 4 hours\\nsitting  per day, and the CE' s opinion about whether a person can work sitting  no more than 4\\nhours a day and standing  no more than 4 hours per day, or walking  no more than 1 hour per day\\nwith a sit/stand option is not a substitute for vocational testimony  on the subject.\\n3. There were not a substantial number of jobs in the state or region of the jobs identified by the\\nVE and used by  the AL J.\\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe ALJ found the opinion of the consultative examiner was “somewhat persuasive.”  However,\\nthe CE found that the claimant was limited to sitting  for a total of four hours in an 8-hour workday ;\\na finding  inconsi stent with the ALJ’s finding  that claimant could perform sedentary  work.  The\\nAppeals Council noted that a full rang e of sedentary  work allows for standing  two hours in an 8-\\nhour workday  and sitting  a total of six hours in an 8-hour workday  in accordance with SSR 96-9p. \\nThe Appe als Council also found the decision does not provide an adequate symptom evaluation\\nin accordance with SSR 16-3p.  While the decision lists the seven factors used when evaluating  the\\nintensity , persistence, and limiting effects of an individual’s symptoms, it does “not appear that\\nthey were considered or evaluated in the decision.”  These seven factors are: (1) daily  activities;\\n(2) duration, frequency , and intensity  of pain and other symptoms; (3) precipitating  and aggravating\\nfactors; (4) the type, dosag e, effectiveness, and side effects of medication; (5) treatment other than\\nmedication; (6) other measures used to relieve symptoms; and (7) other factors related to the\\nclaimant’s functional limitations and restrictions.  \\nFinally , while the decision does consider that the claimant failed to follow throug h on prescribed\\nphysical therapy , SSR 16-3p states SSA will not find an individual’s symptoms inconsistent with\\nthe evidence in the recor d on this basis without considering  possible reasons he or she may not\\ncomply  with treatment or seek treatment consistent with the degree of his or her complaints.  In this\\n681\\ncase the decision states, “[i]t does not appear providers suggested invasive therapy , such as surgery,\\nor even injections, and the claimant failed to follow throug h on prescrib ed physical therapy ,\\npossibly  content with her treatment regimen, to which she attributed pain relief and increased\\nfunctionality ,” a finding  which does not provide adequate consideration of possible reasons she did\\nnot follow throug h with phy sical therapy . \\n \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•further evaluate the claimant’s alleg ed symptoms and provide rationale in accordance with\\nthe disability  regulations pertaining  to evaluation of sy mptoms; \\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinion(s) pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1520c and, as appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical source to provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion; \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support of assessed\\nlimitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source opinion(s) pursuant to the provisions\\nof 20 CFR 404.1520c. As appro priate, the ALJ may request the medical source provide\\nadditional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinion; \\n•if warranted by the expanded record, obtain supplemental evidence from a vocational\\nexpert to clarify  the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant’s occupational base.\\nThe hypothetical questions should reflect  the specific capacity /limitations established by\\nthe record as a whole.  The ALJ will ask the vocational expert to identify  examples of\\nappropriate jobs and to state the incidence of such jobs in the national economy  Further,\\nbefore relying on the vocational expert evidence the ALJ will identif y and resolve any\\nconflicts between the occupational evidence provided by the VE and information in the\\nDOT; \\n• offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , address the evidence which was submitted\\nwith the request for review, take any further action needed to complete the administrative\\nrecord and issue a new decision. \\n682\\n683\\n684\\n685\\n686\\n687\\n688\\n689\\nLetter Brief #39\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Consistency  Factor\\n• Consideration of L ay Witness Evidence\\n• Failure to Address L imitations from Opinions AL J Credited\\n• RFC – Time Off Task \\n• Unsupported RF C \\n• Subjective Complaints/Sy mptoms\\n• Failure to  F ollow Prescribed Treatment – AL J Duty  to Inquire About Reasons\\n• Sig nificant Number of J obs\\n• Reliance on Obsolete J obs\\n \\nArguments:\\n1.The AL J ignored medical opinions relevant to the period at issue.\\n2.The AL J “considered the increase in headaches and migraines” in assessing  claimant’s RF C,\\nbut she supplied no RFC limitations to accommodate headache triggers and did not explain\\ntheir absence.\\n3.The AL J ignored two reports from claimant’s mother.   \\n4.The AL J did not address the inconsistent numbers of available jobs at Step F ive. \\n5.New and material evidence further supports claimant’s Child’s Disability  Benefits claim. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe Appeals Council affirmed the AL J’s decision finding  claimant disabled beg inning  April 24,\\n2020, but vacated the decision with respect to the issue of disability  before March 23, 2017, when\\nthe claimant turned age 22. At step 2, the ALJ found no medically  determinable mental impairment\\nas of age 22.  However, the ALJ failed to address the persuasiveness of an evaluation  that was\\nconsistent with claimant’s longstanding  history  since her childhood of poor concentra tion, memory,\\ndistractibility , and difficulties with time manag ement.  Under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520c, the ALJ was\\nrequired to articulate the persuasiveness all of the medical opinions and all of the prior\\nadministrative medical finding s in the case record.   \\nIn assessi ng RFC, the hearing  decision does not contain an adequate consideration of evidence\\nfrom the claimant’s mother, who noted significa nt symptoms and challeng es since claimant’s\\ndecompression surgery.  Under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545(a)(3), 416.945(a)(3), the ALJ was required\\nto consider all relevant medical and other evidence in assessing  the claimant’s RF C.  \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n•give further consideration to the medical source opinions pursuant to the provisions of 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520c, 416.920c.  As appropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources\\n690\\nprovide additional evidence and/or further clarification of the opinions, and may enlist the\\naid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing  evidence from the\\nclaimant’s medical sources. In doing so, clarify  whether opinions reflect the claimant’s\\ncondition as of March 23, 2017;\\n•further evaluate the claimant’s mental impairments in accordance with the special\\ntechnique described in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a, documenting  application of the\\ntechnique in the decision by providing  specific finding s and appropriate rationale for each\\nof the functional areas;   \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC and provide appropriate\\nrationale with specific reference s to evidence of record in support of the assessed\\nlimitations; and\\n•offer the claimant opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete the\\nadministrative record and issue a new decision on the issue of disability  on or before March\\n23, 2017. \\nCaveat: EM-24027, effective June 22, 2024, clarifies and consolidates guidance related to eviden-\\ntiary support required before relying on certain obsolete occupations to find a claimant “not\\ndisabled” using the Grids.   \\n691\\n692\\n693\\n694\\n695\\n696\\n697\\n698\\nLetter Brief #40\\nTopics Addres sed:\\n• Medical Ex pert Testimony  Not Addressed \\n• Failure to I ncorporate PRTF  Finding s into Mental RF C\\n• Past Relevant W ork – Not SGA \\n• Past Relevant W ork – Not W orked L ong Enoug h to L earn the J ob\\n• Skill L evel of Past Work\\n• Duty  to Develop the Mental and Phy sical Demands of Past W ork  \\n• Evaluation of Medical Source Opinions – Supportability  Factor\\n• Subpoena – AL J’s Failure to Notify  and Provide Rationale for Denial of Request\\n• VE Qualifications\\nArguments:\\n1.Medical Ex pert (ME) testified claimant met L isting s 12.04 &  12.06.\\n2.HAL LEX I-2-5-78(D) (Deny ing a Subpoena Request) was not followed. \\n3.

Failure to comply  with Security  Ruling  96-8p. \\nAppea ls Council Acti on:\\nThe  Appeals Council noted that while the ALJ found the claimant’s bipolar disorder and general\\nanxiety disorder were severe with a mild limitations in understanding , remembering  or applying\\ninformation and interacting  with others and moderate limitations in concentrating , persisting  or\\nmaintaining  pace and adapting  or manag ing oneself, this “B” criteria evaluation is inconsistent with\\nthe RFC finding  that claimant could perform a full range of work at all exertional levels except\\nfast-paced production work.  Specifically , the RFC did not address the level of work that claimant\\ncould perform imposed by  moderate limitations in adapting  or manag ing oneself. \\nThe Appeals Council found that in rejecting  the opinion s of the consultative examiner and the\\nclaimant’s social worker regarding  the claimant’s mental limitations, the ALJ did not provide\\nsufficient rationale with specific references to the evidence of record to explain why these opinions\\nwere not supported.  In addition, the ALJ found that the claimant is capable of performing  her past\\nrelevant work as an interior designer, which the Appeals Council noted is described in the DOT\\nas skilled light work (SVP 7).  The Appeals Council found unclear whether the claimant would be\\nable to perform this work with these possible mental work-related limitations, thus finding  further\\nevaluation of the severity  of the claimant’s mental impairments necessary . \\nThe Appeals Council remanded the case and directed that on remand, the AL J will:\\n699\\n•if warranted and necessa ry, obtain additional evidence concerning  the claimant’s mental\\nimpairments in order to complete the administrative record in accordance with the\\nregulatory  standards regarding  consultative ex aminations and ex isting  medical evidence. \\nThe ALJ may enlist the aid and cooperation of the claimant’s representative in developing\\nevidence from the claimant’s treating  sources. \\n•give further consideration to the claimant’s maximum RFC during  the entire period at issue\\nand provide appropriate rationale with specific references to evidence of record in support\\nof the assessed limitations.  In so doing , evaluate the medical source opinions and prior\\nadministrative medical finding s pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R. 416.920c. As\\nappropriate, the ALJ may request the medical sources to provide additional evidence and/or\\nfurther clarification of the opinions. \\n•obtain vocational evidence sufficient to allow a comparison between the claimant’s residual\\nfunctional capacity  and the mental and physical demands of her past relevant work.  If\\nconsideratio n is given to step five of the sequential evaluation, the ALJ will obtain\\nsupplemental evidence from a vocational expert to clarify  the effect of the assessed\\nlimitations on the claimant’s occupational base. The hypothetical questions should reflect\\nthe specific capacity / limitations established by the record as a whole.  The ALJ will ask\\nthe vocational expert to identify  examples of appropriate jobs and to state the incidence of\\nsuch jobs in the national economy  Further, before relying on the vocational expert evidence\\nthe ALJ will identify  and resolve any conflicts between the occupational evidence provided\\nby the VE and information in the DOT; and\\n•offer the claimant an opportunity  for a hearing , take any further action needed to complete\\nthe administrative record and issue a new decision. \\n \\n \\n700\\n701\\n702\\n703\\n704\\n705\\n706\\n707\\n708\\n \\nORDER FORMName: ___________________________________________ Firm______________________________________________\\nAddress: ____________________________________________________________________ Tel: (_____)_____________\\nCity, State, Zip: ___________________________________________________  Email:_____________________________\\nPlease return the order form, with your check, payable to Sarah H.

Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the functional impact of the claimant's severe obesity on her residual functional capacity (RFC), as required by SSR 96-8p and SSR 19-2p?\\n\\n2. How did the ALJ's failure to discuss obesity-related limitations in the RFC assessment affect the overall disability determination?\\n\\n3. Did the ALJ properly consider the claimant's degenerative disc disease, diabetes, and hypertension in conjunction with her obesity, particularly regarding their cumulative effects on her functional capacity?\\n\\n4. Did the ALJ err in concluding that the claimant could perform her past relevant work as a cloth inspector, given the vocational expert's testimony that this job requires medium exertional levels and frequent overhead reaching?\\n\\n5. Did the Appeals Council appropriately direct the ALJ to obtain a consultative pulmonary examination and updated pulmonary testing to assess the severity of the claimant's pulmonary impairment?\\n\\n6. Did the ALJ fail to adequately evaluate the claimant's fibromyalgia in accordance with SSR 12-2p, particularly in light of overlapping symptoms with other impairments?\\n\\n7. Did the ALJ neglect to consider the impact of the claimant's medication side effects on her cognitive functioning and ability to maintain attention, as outlined in SSR 14-1p?\\n\\n8. Did the ALJ provide sufficient rationale for rejecting the opinions of the claimant's treating physicians regarding the severity of her impairments and their impact on her ability to work?\\n\\n9. Did the ALJ fail to address the potential impact of the claimant's migraines on her RFC, as required by SSR 19-4p?\\n\\n10. Did the ALJ adequately evaluate the claimant's subjective complaints of pain and fatigue, and how did any failures in this regard affect the overall decision?\\n\\n11. Did the ALJ's decision to dismiss the claimant's reports of incontinence and its impact on her ability to work constitute a significant error?\\n\\n12. Did the ALJ fail to consider the longitudinal record of the claimant's mental health treatment and its implications for her mental residual functional capacity?\\n\\n13. Did the ALJ properly evaluate the GAF ratings provided by the claimant's treating sources, considering the lack of standardization and the need for supporting evidence?\\n\\n14. Did the ALJ's failure to incorporate all severe impairments into the RFC assessment violate the requirements of the Social Security regulations?\\n\\n15. Did the ALJ err in not obtaining a vocational expert's testimony to clarify the effect of the assessed limitations on the claimant's occupational base?\\n\\n16. Did the ALJ adequately consider the impact of the claimant's diabetes mellitus on her ability to work, particularly in light of SSR 14-2p?\\n\\n17.
