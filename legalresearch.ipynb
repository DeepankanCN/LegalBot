See 2024 WL 3291790\\n(S.S.A. June 6, 2024);  89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June 6, 2024). The ruling  explains how SSA evaluates\\npast relevant work (PRW ) at step four of the sequential evaluation process in establishing  disability\\nunder titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations.  See pages\\n42-43, 59-66 for arg uments based on SSR 24-2p.    \\nSSR 24-2p provides guidance on whether an individual retains the RFC to perform the demands of\\ntheir PRW  at step four, in a “question and answer” format that answers the following  questions:\\n1.How do we define past relevant work ( PRW ?\\nSSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that an individual has performed: (1) within the past five\\nyears; (2) that was substantial gainful activity  (“SGA”) as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1571\\n- 404.1575 and §§ 416.971-416.975; and (3) that lasted long enoug h for the individual to\\nlearn to do the work.  However, work that the individual started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days is not considered PRW  under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)-(ii) and\\n416.960(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\\n2.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work was performed within the past 5\\nyears?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured from the date\\nof the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  I n some situations, the relevant period\\nis measured from an earlier date. See SSR 18-1p: Titles II and XVI: Determining the\\nEstablished Onset Date (EOD)  in Disability Claims , which identifies the most common\\ntypes of disability  claims and some of the regulations that explain the non-medical\\nrequirements for those types of claims.

The ruling  includes a table that provides guidelines for\\ncommon scenarios.\\n3.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days?\\nSSR 24-2p provide s that work is not PRW  if an individual started and stopped it in fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days, defined as a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends,\\nstarting  from the first day of work .  SSA generally  does not consider the total number of\\nhours or days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or part-time. \\nThe 30 calendar days requirement is separate from the consideration of SGA or whether an\\nindividual worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days\\nmay count toward the time needed for an individual to learn to do the work. \\nxiv\\nMoreover, if an individual was self-employ ed or an independent contractor, SGA will\\nconsider whether the individual was engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days,\\neven if individual work assig nments or contr acts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.\\nExamples of different scenarios are provided in the ruling , including  in footnote 14, which\\nexplains PRW includes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or\\nmore because the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even thoug h each\\nindividual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. \\n4.How do we determine whether an individual performed work long enough to learn to do it?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that the individual gained sufficient\\njob experience to learn the techniques, acquire information, and develop the facility  needed\\nfor averag e performance in the job.  The length of time this would take depends  on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific vocational\\npreparation (SVP).\\n5.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW ?\\nThere are two methods used to determine whether an individual can perform his or her PRW  \\n– whether they can perform the work as “actually  performed or as generally  performed in\\nthe national economy.”  “As they actually  performed it” looks to whether the individual\\nretains the RFC to perform the particular functional demands peculiar to the work the\\nindividual did.  “As it is generally  performed in the national economy ” looks to whether the\\nindividual retains the capacity  to perform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily\\nrequired throug hout the national economy , based on descriptions of occupations from\\nreliable sources of job information or from a vocational specialist or vocational ex pert. \\n6.How do we determine whether an individual can perform their PRW  as they actually\\nperformed it?\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work are generally\\nsufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental demands of such work.   \\nHowever, if the individual cannot provide this information, with the individual’s permission,\\nSSA will attempt get it from their employ er or another person who knows about  the\\nindividual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the individual to\\ntell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless the job started and stopped\\nin fewer than 30 calendar day s), including :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the individual did\\nduring  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of their work.\\n7.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW  as it is generally performed\\nin the national economy?\\nxv\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform their PRW  as it is generall y performed\\nin the national economy , SSA considers whether the individual retains the capacity  to\\nperform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily  required throug hout the national\\neconomy .  SSA may rely on descriptions of occupations  from reliable sources of job\\ninformation to determine how occupations are generally  performed. A vocational specialist\\nor vocational expert may also provide information about how an occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform a job as actually  performed, an\\nindividual’s job may have involved functional demands that are different from those\\ngenerally  required for the occupation throug hout the national economy . If the individual\\ncannot meet the functional demands actually  required in the former job but can meet the\\nfunctional demands as generally  required throug hout the economy, we will find the\\nindividual able to perform PRW  and not disabled.\\n8.How do we obtain evidence concerning an individual’s work history?\\nAn individual is the primary  source for infor mation concerning  their work history , but we\\nconsider all available evidence and information. Statements by the individual about their past\\nwork are generally  sufficient for deter mining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. If the individual cannot give us all the information we need, we may\\ntry, with the individual’s permission, to get it from their employ er or another person who\\nknows about the individual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nWe will ask the individual to tell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless\\nthe job started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days). The individual must tell us the\\ndates they worked, the duties they performed, and any tools, machinery , and equipment they\\nused. We will need to know the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing\\nthe individual did during  the workday , as well as any  other phy sical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\n9.What information do we require when determining whether work is PRW  that an individual\\ncan perform?\\nThis may include detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental demands,\\nand other job requirements. Information concerning  dates work was performed, tools and\\nmachines used, the extent of supervision required, and a descrip tion of tasks and\\nresponsibilities, may be needed to determine whether the work is PRW  that the individual\\ncan perform. If more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, SSA will request\\nseparate descriptions of each job the individual performed during  the relevant period. SSA\\nwill g ive careful consideration to:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no long er be met\\nand the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those requirements;\\n•the individual’s RFC (20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 and 416.945 and SSR 96-8p Assessing\\nResidual Functional Capacity in Initial Claims );  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corroborative information from other sources on the\\nxvi\\nrequirements of the work as actually  performed by the individual or as generally\\nperformed in the economy .\\n10. What findings and rationale must our determination or decision include when we find an\\nindividual is able to perform PRW ?\\nA determination or decisio n that an individual is not disabled, based on their ability  to\\nperform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, must contain adequate rationale and finding s.\\nIn finding  that an individual has the capacity  to perform PRW , the determination or decision\\nmust:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the individual\\nactually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in the national\\neconomy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in\\nthe national economy .\\nSSR 24-1p - HOW WE APPLY  MEDICAL-V OCATIONAL PROFILES\\nEffective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  , How We Apply Medical-Voc ational Profiles,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63, Medical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an\\nAdjustment to Other Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48477 (June\\n6, 2024).  This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three medical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous\\nunskilled work profile;  (2) no work profile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing\\ndisability  under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations. \\n \\nThese three profiles repres ent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two profiles, the\\nlifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but only as it pertained to claimants with\\nvisual impairments.2  This profile was  incorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the\\nrequirements and is not limited to claimants with visual impairments.  The lifetime commitment \\nprofile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .       \\n2 SSR 85- 15 pr ovides that:\\na finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant’s\\nvocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education\\nor less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.\\nxvii\\nSSR   is set up in a “question and answer” format, and answers the following  questions:\\n1.When do we consider the medical-vocational profiles in the sequential evaluation process?\\nSSA will use SSR  on and after its applicable d ate in any case in which the agency makes\\na determination or decision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for\\nfurther administrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR , SSA will apply  this\\nruling  to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. An\\nindividual can only  be found disabled based on a medical-vocational profile if a finding  at\\nstep four has been made that they do not have or are unable to perform their PRW .  At step\\nfive, an adjudicator must consider whether a medical-vocational profile applies before using\\nthe medical-vocational g uidelines.\\n2.What are the requirements of the arduous unskilled work profile?\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is not working at SGA level (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 404.1572, 416.910 and\\n416.072); \\n•has a history of 35 years or more of arduous unskilled work (see 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1568 and 416.968); \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s) (see\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1522 and 416.922); and \\n•has no more than a marg inal education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564 and 416.964). \\n \\nSSR 24-1p notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types of jobs, and that generally\\nSSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade level or less is a marg inal education.\\nHowever, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not reflect their\\nactual educational abilities.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b). The ruling  also\\ncites to SSR 20-1p: Titles II and XVI: How We Determine an Individual’s Education\\nCategory , which is discussed, infra  at xxxi.  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is used for an individual whose work experience includes\\nvery short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work, as long as the individual did not acquire\\nany transferable skills from those periods of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968.\\nSSA considers occupations with specific vocational preparation (“SVP”) levels one and two\\nto be unskilled, three and four to be semi-skille d, and five or greater to be skilled.  See\\nPOMS DI 25015.015 Work Experience as a Vocational Factor , and DOT Appendix  C.  See\\nalso SSR 00-4p Use of Vocational Expert and Vocational Specialist Evidence , and Other\\nReliable Occupational Informati on in Disability  Decisions.  See pages 69, infra, for a\\ndiscussion of SVP levels. The ruling also cites to SSR 82-41: Work Skills and Their\\nTransferability as Intended by the Expanded Vocational Factors Regulations for additional\\ninformation about how SSA considers skills from past work under its rules.  See page 122,\\ninfra , for a discussion of SSR 82-41.  \\nxviii\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also used for an individual whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired is not readily\\ntransferable to lig hter work.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as physical work requir ing a high level of streng th or\\nendurance.  Arduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or exertional\\nlevel, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical demands that we would classify\\nas heavy  or very heavy  based on the individual’s description of their past work. See 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1567 and 416.967.  Work that SSA would not classify  as heavy  or very heavy\\nmay still be considered arduous if, for example, it demands a great deal of stamina or if it\\ninvolves activity  such as repetitive bending  and lifting at a very fast pace.  An adjudicator\\nmust evaluate the record to make the ultimate finding  as to whether an individual’s work\\nmeets this criterion.\\n3.What are the requirements of the no work profile, and do we consider an individual’s RFC\\nwhen determining whether an individual meets this profile?\\nThe no work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other work for an\\nindividual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964).\\n,\\nSSR 24-1p provides that SSA adjudicators do not need to assess or consider RFC when\\napply ing the no work profile.  The ruling  notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA\\nconsiders any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment(s) that meet s the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairment, citing  to SSR 03-3p: Policy Interpretation\\nRuling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and Blindness in Initial Claims for\\nIndividuals 65 or Older  and citing  to SSR 23-1p:  Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement\\nfor Disability , discussed infra at xx, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p states that “limited education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills, but not enoug h to allow an individual with these educational qualifications\\nto do most of the more complex  job duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.  Generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal education is a limited\\neducation.  However, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not\\nreflect their actual educational abilities. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b); see\\nalso SSR 20-01p, How We Determine An Individual’s Education Category , discussed infra\\nat xxxi. \\n4.What are the requirements of the lifetime commitment profile, and how does the lifetime\\ncommitment profile apply to an individual who has worked at multiple jobs or for multiple\\nemployers?\\nSSR 24-1p states that the lifetime commitment profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nxix\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older) ( see 20 C.F.R. §§ 1563\\nand 416.963); \\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level;\\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s). \\nFor purposes of the lifetime commitment profile, the individual’s 30 years o f work do not\\nhave to have been at only one job or for only one employ er.  The jobs must have been in one\\nfield of work, meaning  that the types of work the individual performed must have been very\\nsimilar to one another.  Use of this medical-vocational profile is appropriate even if the\\nindividual has work experience in a field(s) other than the one in which they have a 30-year\\nlifetime commitment, as long as the work experience in the other field(s) is not PRW  that\\nthe individual is still able to perform considering  their RF C.\\nSSR 23-1p - DURATION REQUIREMENT FOR DISABILITY\\nEffective November 7, 2023, Social Security  Ruling 23-1p, Duration Requirement for Disability ,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-52, regarding  the duration of the impairment. The ruling  explains how\\nthe duration requirement is measured and defined, how it affects the sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess, and how SSA makes a finding  about the expected duration of an impairment. It addresses\\nhow duration is considered in continuing  disability  review cases when the beneficiary  or recipient\\nhas a new, severe medically  determined physical or mental impairment. It explains what will happen\\nif SSA learns of a return to substantial gainful employ ment within 12 months of a claimant’s onset\\nof disability . See 2023 W L 8236247 (S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023). \\nSSR 23-1p is set up in “question and answer” format and answers the following  questions: \\n1.How does a claimant meet the duration requirement for disability ? \\n2.What is a medically  determinable impairment (MDI ) that “can be expected to result in\\ndeath”?  \\n3.What do we mean by  “12 continuous months” and how do we measure it in initial claims?\\n4.How does the duration requirement affect  the five-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess?  \\n5.How does the duration requiremen t affect the three-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess for Title XVI  claimants who have not y et attained 18 y ears of ag e? \\n6.How do we consider the duration requirement when the claimant has new, severe MDI (s)\\nin continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases?  \\n7.What if we find that the claimant meets the duration  requirement based on an expectation\\nof continued severity , but the claimant returned to SGA within 12 months?  \\nxx\\nSSR 22-1p AND SSR 22-2P ADDRESSING FRAUD AND \\nSIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS \\n(formerly SSR 16-1p and 16-2p) \\nEffective May 17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p addressing Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and rescinded and replaced SSR 16-2p, addressing  the\\nEvaluation of Claims Involving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-\\n2p. Each of these new ruling s chang e the evidentiary  standard from “preponderance of the evidence”\\nto “reason to believe” and provide that before SSA will disreg ard evidence under the Act at the\\nhearing s level of the administrative review process,  the individual’s objection to the disreg arding\\nof that evidence will be considered, among  other chang es more fully discussed in the arguments\\nregarding  the new ruling s, infra, at pag es 238-47. \\nSSA stated in issuing  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p that the agency expects that these revised\\nprocedures will allow implementation of relevant sections of the Social Security  Act in a manner\\nconsistent with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the\\nprocedures outlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. These challeng es were based on principles\\nof constitutional due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, as discussed in the detailed\\ndescriptions of these ruling s, infra  at pag es 238-47.\\nREGULATORY  CHANGE OF  THE DEFINITION OF PAST RELEV ANT WORK BY\\nREDUCING THE RELE VANT PERIOD FROM 15 Y EARS TO FIV E YEARS \\nThe SSA has issued a final rule effective June 8, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to the Disability\\nAdjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work, 89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024). \\nThe effective date was subsequently  deferred to June 22, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).  The rule revises the definition of past relevant work (PRW ) by reducing  the relevant work\\nperiod from the current 15 years to five years.  The rule notes that this often reduces the number of\\njobs in an individual’s work history  that SSA will consider at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess when determining  whether an individual can perform PRW .  On J une 25, 2024, SSA also\\nissued Emerg ency Messag e 24028, providing supplemental instructions for res judicata policy\\napplication, considering  the chang e to the regulatory  definition of past relevant work, discussed infra\\nat xxiii.\\nAt step five, this revision will also change the previous work experience that SSA will consider\\nunder the Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  Because a step four finding  can result in a denial but not\\nan allowance, SSA anticipates making  proportionally  fewer denial decisions at step four and\\nproportionally  more decisions at step five and expects that shifting  decisions from step four to step\\nfive with less past work considered will result in more allowance decisions. \\nThis final rule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability  review\\n(CDR) cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial disabil ity sequential\\nevaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no longer consider past work that started and\\nstoppe d in fewer than 30 calendar days to be PRW .  The rule also notes that in the Notice of\\nProposed Rule Making  (NPRM) for this rule, SSA proposed to remove a current sentence in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a) and 416.965(a) that explains the intent of the work experience rules is to\\nxxi\\n“ensure that remote work experience is not currently  applied” in order to reflect that the arduous\\nunskilled work profile and the lifetime commitment profile consider work history  for a period long er\\nthan the proposed five year relevant work period; the final rule notes this chang e was made in 88\\nFed. Reg . 83877 (Dec. 1, 2023).  \\nSSA makes these revisions in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and 416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years that was substantial\\ngainful activity  and that lasted long  enoug h for you to learn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We\\nwill not consi der work to be past relevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than\\n30 calendar day s (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consid er past relevant work and work experience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar\\ndays means a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day\\nof work.  When we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or day s worked during  that period, or whether the work\\nwas full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days requir ement is separate from the\\nconsideration of substantial gainful activity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn\\nhow to do the work, althoug h the work performed during  the 30 calenda r days may count\\ntoward the time needed for y ou to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar days requirement\\nalso applies if you were self-employ ed or an independent contractor; we will consider\\nwhether you were engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual\\nwork assig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a): \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 4 16.965(a) from the prior text, “If you\\nhave no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for brief periods of time during  the\\nfive-y ear period, we generally  consider that these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as,\\n“If you have no work experience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear period, we\\ngenerally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the justification for the rule is to\\nallow individuals to focus on the most current and relevant information about their past\\nwork, better reflect the current evidence base on chang es over time in worker skill decay  and\\njob responsi bilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service, and reduce the\\nburden on individuals. \\nNew  SSR 24-2p and Rescissions : Pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-2p - Titles\\nII and XVI: How We Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effective June 22, 2024, which rescinds SSR 86-\\n8, and rescinds and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose of SSR 24-2p is to explain\\nhow SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform\\nthe demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy  set forth in SSA’s\\nregulations so that those regulations will be consi stently applied. See SSR 24-2p –  How We\\nEvaluate Past Relevant Work, 2024 WL 3291790 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June\\n6, 2024), discussed at pag es xiv-xvii, supra . \\nxxii\\nNew  SSR 24-1p and Rescissions: Also pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-1p,\\nTitles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , effective June 22, 2024, which\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63 .  The purpose of SSR  24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the\\nthree medical-vocational profiles - (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2)  no work profile; and (3)\\nlifetime commitment profile. These profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them\\nwill be found to be unable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process\\nwithout reference to the medical-vocational guidelines. The ruling  describes the profiles as follows:\\n1.Arduous unskilled work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\n \\n2.No work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education.  \\n3.Lifetime commitment profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older);\\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s).\\nSSR 24-1p, Titles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Vocational Profiles , 2024 WL 3291789\\n(S.S.A.

The new definition is less restrictive in two\\nways:  (1) The relevant period conside rs 5 years rather than 15 years of past work, and (2)\\nWork that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2.Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe EM notes that administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided,\\nit does not need to be decided again.  Res judicata is applied at all levels of the adjudication\\nprocess to avoid deciding  an issue that has previously  been decided based on the same facts,\\nsame issues, same parties, and same adjudicative period and is applicable only with respect\\nto the period covered by the prior final determination or decision.  The end of this period will\\ngenerally  correspond to the date of the prior final determination or decision, except when the\\ndate the claimant last met the non-disability  requirements for entitlement expired prior to the\\ndate of the final determination or decision.\\n3. Policy\\nThe EM announ ces SSA will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously\\nadjudicated period when the prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found\\nthe individual could do:  \\n1) PRW at step four of the sequential evaluation process and the PRW  cited is not PRW\\nunder the PRW  rule; OR\\n2)Other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process , work experience was\\nmaterial to the decision, and the individual’s work experience is different under the PRW\\nrule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, SSA will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or\\ndismiss a request for hearing  on that claim.\\nThe EM provides procedures and g uidance for SSA staff in implementing  this policy .4\\n4Editor’s Note: In the limited circumstances where a case has received a final determination, and the new\\nPRW rules would have resulted in a favorable outcome, representatives may wish to consider filing a new\\napplication instead of additional appeals in light of EM- 24028.  In the new application, a claimant could\\npursue an alleged onset date that predates the prior denial without the restriction of res judicata.

The EM states: \\nBeginning  7/13/2024, we will adopt our prior favorable finding  of disability  in a subsequent\\nclaim by the same individual for a different disability  benefit or SSI payments if, in our prior\\nfinal determination or decision, we have already  decided that the individual is disabled for\\nthe period in question and all of the following  criteria are met:\\n1.

The ruling  went into effect on April 27, 2020, the same day  new reg ulations\\nwere issued which removed “inability  to communicate in English” as an education categ ory. See 85\\nFed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020). Now SSA will have four education categ ories at step five of the\\nsequential evaluation process:\\n1)High school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nskills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level or above” which generally\\npermits performance of semi-skilled throug h skilled work.\\n2)Limited education – some reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills abilities acquired\\nthroug h a 7th – 11th grade education, but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job\\nduties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.”\\n3)Marginal education – reasoning,  arithmetic, and language skills abilities needed for\\nsimple, unskilled jobs, g enerally  a 6th grade education or less.\\n4)Illiteracy – defined as “an inability to read or write” even simple messag es like\\ninstructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can sign his or her name. Generally\\nxxxi\\nhas little or no formal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p also acknowledg es that other evidence may show a higher or lower level of education\\nthan formal schooling  level would suggest. Examples of the evidence used are “past work\\nexperien ce, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily  activities,\\nhobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and vocational training . Another factor that SSA\\nmay consider is an extensive history  of special education, which can show in a particular case that\\nthe individual’s educational abilities are lower than the grade completed.  This ruling  amends the\\nfollowing  regulations:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964 and 20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines\\nHEARINGS HELD BY  ADMINISTRATIV E APPEALS JUDGES\\nOF THE APPEALS COUNCIL\\n \\nUnder a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA revised its rules to clarify  when and how\\nadministrative appeals judges (AAJ) on the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisions.\\nSee Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 F ed. Reg . 73138\\n(Nov. 16, 2020). Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the authority  to hold hearing s\\nand issue decisions under the existing  statute and regulations, but SSA had not exercised this\\nauthor ity or explained the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals\\nCouncil to assume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\nThe clarifications made by the rule ensure the Appeals Council is not limited in the type of claims\\nfor which it may hold hearing s. The stated goal of the rule is to increase adjudicative capacity  when\\nneeded, allowing  quicker adjustment to fluctuating  short-term workloads, such as when an influx\\nof cases reaches the hearing s level. The final rule amends or revises the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Rem oval of a hearing request(s) to the Appeals\\nCouncil)  provides that the “Appea ls Council may assume responsibility  for a hearing\\nrequest(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the administrative review process” and requires\\nsending  a “notice to all parties that the Appeals Council has assumed responsibility  for the\\ncase(s).” The Appeals Council is required to conduct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, applicab le to SSDI  claims and 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461, applicable to SSI claims.  Appeals Council review may be requested by any party\\ndissatisfied with the hearing  decision or with the dismissal of a hearing  request, following\\nthe procedures in §§ 404.967 throug h 404.982 for SSDI  claims and §§ 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461 for SSI claims.  The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judge who conducted\\na hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismissed a hearing  request will not participate in\\nany action associated with the request for Appeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.983, 416.1483 (Case remanded by a Federal court)  provides that when\\na Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, one option\\nlisted in the regulations is for the Appeals Council to schedule a hearing. The Appeals\\nCouncil may  take any  of these actions: \\nxxxii\\n•make a decision either without a hearing ; \\n•make a decision with a hearing ; \\n•dismiss the proceeding s, ex cept in limited circumstances; or \\n•remand the case to an ALJ “with instructions to take action and issue a decision or\\nreturn the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision.\\n If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility  for issuing  a decision and “a hearing  is\\nnecessary  to complete adjudication of the claim(s), an administrative appeals judge will hold\\na hearing  using  the procedures set forth in §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, as applicable.”  See\\n20 C.F .R.§§ 416.1429 throug h 416.1461, for the reg ulations applicable to SSI  claims. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.984, 416.1484 (Appeals Council review  of hearing decision in a case\\nremanded by a Federal court)  provi des that the decision of the ALJ or administrative\\nappeals judge will become the final decision of the Commissioner after remand unless the\\nAppeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case based on written exceptions to the decision\\nfiled with the Appeals Council or based on its authority  to hold a hearing . If no ex ceptions\\nare filed and the Appeals Counc il does not assume jurisdiction, the decision of the\\nadministrative law judg e or administrative appeals judg e becomes the final decision of the\\nCommissioner after remand. \\nREMOV ING “INABILITY  TO COMMUNICATE\\nIN ENGLISH” AS AN EDUCATION CATEGORY\\nThis final rule became effective April 27, 2020 and  eliminates the education categ ory “inability  to\\ncommunicate in English” when SSA evaluates disability  claims for adults under titles  II and XVI\\nof the Social Security  Act. See 85 Fed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020).  The preamble explains that this\\neducation category is no longer a useful indicator of an individual’s educational attainment or of the\\nvocational impact of an individual’s education because of chang es in the national workforce since\\nadoption of the prior rule more than 40 years ago and that these revisions “will help us better assess\\nthe vocational impact of education in the disability determination process.”  Id.  This final rule\\namends the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964  – Your education as a vocational factor\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –  Medical-Vocational Guidelines      \\nSETTING THE MANNER FOR THE APPEARA NCE OF\\nPARTIES AND WITNESSES AT A HEARING\\nThis final rule became effective January  17, 2020 and sets the time, place, and manner of appearance\\nfor hearing s at the administrative law judge (ALJ) level of SSA’s administrative review process,\\nwith modifications. It states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will appear at a\\nhearing  before an ALJ and will set the time and place for the hearing  according ly. Parties to a\\nhearing  will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone. Under this final rule, SSA will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing  based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the\\nxxxiii\\nability  to opt out of appearing  by VTC at the AL J hearing s level. The F inal Rule ex plains:\\nFinally , we are revising  our rule to state that, at the ALJ hearing  level, if we need to\\nsend an  amended notice of hearing , or if we need to schedule a supplemental\\nhearing , we will send the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  at least\\n20 days before the date of the hearing . The date of hearing  indicated in the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  will be at least 75 day s from the\\ndate we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing , unless the claimant has waived his\\nor her rig ht to advance notice. \\nThis final rule modifies the following  regulatory  sections:\\n§§ 404.929, 416.1429 – Hearing  before an administrative law  judg e - general.\\n§§ 404.936, 416.1436 – Time and place for a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.938, 416.1438 – Notice of a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.950, 416.1450 – Presenting  evidence to a hearing  before an administrative law judge.\\n§§ 404.976, 416.1476  – Procedures before the Appeals Council on  review.\\nSee 84 F ed. Reg . 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019).  \\nREVISED MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EV ALUATING\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS\\nAs part of its ongoing review of the Listings, SSA developed these final rules, effective April 2,\\n2021, to revise the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments that are used to evaluate claims involving\\nmusculoskeletal disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act,\\nto update the medical criteri a and clarify  how it evaluates musculoskeletal disorders. SSA also\\nmakes a conforming  chang e to the endocrine disorders body  system to comport with the chang e it\\nproposed to 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m) to be consistent with these final rules.  The new functional\\ncriteria include:\\n1.A documented medical need for a walker, two canes, or two crutches or a wheeled and\\nseated mobility  device (WSMD) (such as a manual wheelchair) involving  the use of both\\nhands, or\\n2. An inability  to use one upper extremity  to independently  initiate, sustain, and complete\\nwork-related activities4F  5 involving  fine and gross movements, and a documente d\\nmedical need for a one-handed, hand-held assistive device that requires the use of your\\nother upper extremity  or a WSMD involving  the use of one hand (such as a powered\\nwheelchair), or\\n3. An inability  to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to\\nindependently  initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities5 involving  fine and\\ngross movements.\\nThese criteria represent the level of dysfunction for upper and lower extremities that would cause\\nxxxiv\\nan adult to be unable to work or a child to be unable to perform age-appropriate activities. Assistive\\ndevices are considered as part of the first and second functional criteria in the musculoskeletal\\ndisorders listing s. These final rules also:\\n•Eliminate the requirement that there must be a prescription for an assistive device;\\n•Differentiate between patholog ic fractures and fractures caused by a traumatic even t\\nbecause the medical treatment and recovery  expectations for fractures differs, depending\\non the underly ing cause;  \\n•Acknowledg e the rapid development of motor function during  the infant and toddler\\nstages by  adding  a child listing  for evaluating  musculoskeletal disorders of infants and\\ntoddlers, from birth to attainment of ag e 3, with developmental motor \\n•Revise the content and structure of the current listing s to incorporate the new functional\\ncriteria into each listing ;\\n•Add specific sections in the introductory  text to provide g uidance on each listing ;\\n•Emphasize the current policy  that a musculoskeletal disorder may meet or medicall y\\nequal one of these listing s regardless of whether the person was prescribed opioid\\nmedication, or whether the person was prescribed opioid medication and did not follow\\nthis prescribed treatment; and\\n•Make conforming  chang es to the relevant criteria in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and\\nimmune disorders body  systems since those body  systems use terminology from the\\ncurrent musculoskeletal disorders listing  that are revised in these final rules.\\nThese final rules amend 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 – Listing  of Impairments\\nMusculoskeletal Disorders and 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m), addressing  functional equivalence in\\nchildren.  See 85 Fed. Reg . 78164 (Dec 3, 2020). \\n2019 CHANGES IN TH E LAW \\n2019 RULING S: \\nIn 2019, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) published four Social Security  Rulings (SSR): \\nSSR 19-1p addressing  the effect of the Supreme Court decision in  Lucia v. SEC on cases pending\\nat the Appeals Council; SSR 19-2p, addressing  the evaluation of cases involving  obesity ; SSR 19-\\n3p, addressing  requesting  reconsideration and hearing  either by paper or electronically ; and SSR 19-\\n4p, evaluating  cases involvi ng primary  headache disorders.  Highlights of the 2019 ruling s are\\nbelow. \\nSSR 19-1p – EFFECT OF THE DECISION IN LUCIA V . SEC \\nON CASES PENDING AT THE APPEALS COUNCIL  \\nSSR 19-1p explains how SSA will adjudicate cases pending  at the Appeals Council (AC) in which\\nthe claimant has raised a timely  challeng e to the appointment of an administrative law judge (ALJ)\\nunder the Appointments Clause of the United States Const itution in light of the Supreme Court’s\\nxxxv\\ndecision in Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018).  As set forth in Policy Net EM-18003 REV 2 ,1 if\\na claimant or representative files a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e and timely  requests\\nAppeals Council review, the AC will consider the challeng e in the contex t of the facts of the case\\n(including , but not limited to, the date of the ALJ decision and the date the challeng e was raised)\\nin determining  whether there is a basis to g rant review.  \\nThe AC will determine whether granting  review is appropriate under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970 or\\n416.1470, or both, when considering  both the decision on the merits and any potentially  unresolved\\nAppointments Clause issues.  In those matters where a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e to an\\nALJ decision issued prior to J uly 16, 2018 is raised to the Appeals Council in a proper request for\\nreview, the AC will g rant review and issue a decision or order remand, as appropriate.2\\nSSR 19-2P –  EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING OBESITY\\nSSR 19-2p provides g uidance on how SSA establishes that a person has a medically  determinable\\nimpairment of obesity  and how SSA evaluates obesity  in disability  claims.  The new SSR reflects\\nthe chang es to the rules SSA has published, and advances in medical knowledg e, since publication\\nof SSR 02-1p, which is repealed.  SSR 19-2p is discussed in more detail in this publication, under\\n“Specific I mpairments.”  \\nSSR 19-3P –  REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OR HEARING\\nBY AN ADMINISTRATIV E LAW JUDGE\\nSSR 19-3p explains the two options available to claimants appealing  SSA determinations that they\\nare not disabled based on medical factors.  This SSR explains both the paper and electronic options\\nfor requesting  reconsideration or a hearing  by an ALJ, and the similarities and differences between\\nthese two options.  Until recent years, the only way for claimants to request an appeal was to use the\\npaper-based option, which consists of paper appeal forms.  SSA developed an electronic appeals\\nsystem, called iAppeals.  This SSR explains the differences between the paper and electronic appeal\\nprocedure s for filing  a request for reconsideration or a hearing .  A claimant may file a “written\\nrequest” for appeal using  either the paper-based appeals process or iAppeals.  With the iAppeals\\noption the claimant must submit all of the needed information at once.  It is therefore the equivalent\\nof a combined request  and disability  report.  As noted in the ruling , an iAppeals offers several\\nconvenient flex ibility  for claimants: \\n•letting  claimants leave questions blank if inapplicable; \\n•allowing  claimants to indicate that additional time is needed to collect specific evidence;\\nand\\n•enabling  claimants to partially  complete an electronic appeal application, save it, and\\nfinish it later.\\nAfter a claimant files an appeal, he or she can submit evidence by fax, by mail, or in-person at a\\n1 See https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/08062018021025PM( Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n2This ruling is not further discussed as the date to raise the issue to the Appe als Council has passed. \\nxxxvi\\nfield or hearing  office.  However, if using  the iAppeals option, the claimant has an option to upload\\nand simultaneously  submit evidence with the electronic appeal. \\nSSR 19-4P - EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING PRIMARY  HEADACHE DISORDERS\\nSSR 19-4p: Effective August 26, 2019, SSR 19-4p prov ides guidance on how to establish that a\\nperson has a medically  determinable impairment of a primary  headache disorder and how to evaluate\\nprimar y headache disorders in disability  claims.  The SSR evaluates claims involving  primary\\nheadache disorders in a question and answer format.  SSR 19-4p is discussed in more detail in this\\npublication, under “Specific I mpairments.”  \\n2018 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\n2018 RULING S:  \\nThe Social Security  Administration issued three new Social Security  Ruling s: SSR 18-01p  and\\nSSR 18-02p addressing  onset dates of disability  and SSR 18-3p , addressing  the failure to follow\\ntreatment.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 49613; 83 Fed. Reg. 49616; 83 Fed. Reg. 49621. SSR 18-01p  and\\n18-02p together rescind and replace SSR 83-20, pertaining  to the “Onse t of Disability ,” and\\nclarify  how SSA determines the established onset date (EOD) in disability  and blindness claims,\\nrespectively .  These two ruling s became applicable on October 2, 2018.  Highlights of the 2018\\nruling s, discussed in more detail in this publication, are below:  \\nSSR 18-01P – DETERMINING THE ESTABLISHED  ONSET DATE IN DISABILITY\\nCLAIMS  AND SSR 18-02P –  DETERMINING THE ONSET DATE\\n IN BLINDNESS CLAIMS\\nSSR 18-01p specifically  addresses how SSA determines the EOD in claims involving  “traumatic,\\nnontraumatic, and exacerbating and remitting  impairments . . . [as well as] special considerations\\nrelated to the EOD, such as work activity  and previously  adjudicated periods.”  It also clarifies that\\nan ALJ may, but is not required to, call upon a medical expert to assist with inferring  the claimant’s\\nEOD. SSR 18-02p addresses how SSA determines the EOD in statutory  blindness claims, with\\nspecific emphasis on the differences between disability  and blindness claims under the Act.\\nSSR 18-3P – FAILURE TO FOLLOW TREATMENT\\nSSR 18-3p, rescinds and replaces SSR 82–59, pertaining  to the “‘Failure to Follow Prescribed\\nTreatment,’‘ and provides guidance about how SSA applies its “failure to follow prescribed\\ntreatment policy  in disability  and blindness claims under Titles II and XVI” of the Act.  It applies\\nin all determinations and decisions made on or after October 29, 2018.\\nSSR 18-3p explains that SSA will only determine whether a claimant has failed to follow prescribed\\ntreatment when all three of the following  conditions ex ist:\\nxxxvii\\n•The individual would otherwise be entitled to benefits based on disability  or eligible for\\nblindness benefits under Titles I I or XVI  of the Act;\\n•[SSA has] evidence that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed treatment for\\nthe medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\"\n",

See 2024 WL 3291790\\n(S.S.A. June 6, 2024);  89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June 6, 2024). The ruling  explains how SSA evaluates\\npast relevant work (PRW ) at step four of the sequential evaluation process in establishing  disability\\nunder titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations.  See pages\\n42-43, 59-66 for arg uments based on SSR 24-2p.    \\nSSR 24-2p provides guidance on whether an individual retains the RFC to perform the demands of\\ntheir PRW  at step four, in a “question and answer” format that answers the following  questions:\\n1.How do we define past relevant work ( PRW ?\\nSSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that an individual has performed: (1) within the past five\\nyears; (2) that was substantial gainful activity  (“SGA”) as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1571\\n- 404.1575 and §§ 416.971-416.975; and (3) that lasted long enoug h for the individual to\\nlearn to do the work.  However, work that the individual started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days is not considered PRW  under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)-(ii) and\\n416.960(b)(1)(i)-(ii).\\n2.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work was performed within the past 5\\nyears?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured from the date\\nof the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  I n some situations, the relevant period\\nis measured from an earlier date. See SSR 18-1p: Titles II and XVI: Determining the\\nEstablished Onset Date (EOD)  in Disability Claims , which identifies the most common\\ntypes of disability  claims and some of the regulations that explain the non-medical\\nrequirements for those types of claims. See also POMS DI 25001.001 Medical and\\nVocational Quick Reference Guide. The ruling  includes a table that provides guidelines for\\ncommon scenarios.\\n3.How do we determine whether an individual’s past work started and stopped in fewer than\\n30 calendar days?\\nSSR 24-2p provide s that work is not PRW  if an individual started and stopped it in fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days, defined as a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends,\\nstarting  from the first day of work .  SSA generally  does not consider the total number of\\nhours or days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or part-time. \\nThe 30 calendar days requirement is separate from the consideration of SGA or whether an\\nindividual worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days\\nmay count toward the time needed for an individual to learn to do the work. \\nxiv\\nMoreover, if an individual was self-employ ed or an independent contractor, SGA will\\nconsider whether the individual was engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days,\\neven if individual work assig nments or contr acts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.\\nExamples of different scenarios are provided in the ruling , including  in footnote 14, which\\nexplains PRW includes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or\\nmore because the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even thoug h each\\nindividual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. \\n4.How do we determine whether an individual performed work long enough to learn to do it?\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that the individual gained sufficient\\njob experience to learn the techniques, acquire information, and develop the facility  needed\\nfor averag e performance in the job.  The length of time this would take depends  on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific vocational\\npreparation (SVP).\\n5.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW ?\\nThere are two methods used to determine whether an individual can perform his or her PRW  \\n– whether they can perform the work as “actually  performed or as generally  performed in\\nthe national economy.”  “As they actually  performed it” looks to whether the individual\\nretains the RFC to perform the particular functional demands peculiar to the work the\\nindividual did.  “As it is generally  performed in the national economy ” looks to whether the\\nindividual retains the capacity  to perform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily\\nrequired throug hout the national economy , based on descriptions of occupations from\\nreliable sources of job information or from a vocational specialist or vocational ex pert. \\n6.How do we determine whether an individual can perform their PRW  as they actually\\nperformed it?\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work are generally\\nsufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental demands of such work.   \\nHowever, if the individual cannot provide this information, with the individual’s permission,\\nSSA will attempt get it from their employ er or another person who knows about  the\\nindividual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the individual to\\ntell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless the job started and stopped\\nin fewer than 30 calendar day s), including :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the individual did\\nduring  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of their work.\\n7.How do we determine whether an individual can perform PRW  as it is generally performed\\nin the national economy?\\nxv\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform their PRW  as it is generall y performed\\nin the national economy , SSA considers whether the individual retains the capacity  to\\nperform the occupation’s functional demands as ordinarily  required throug hout the national\\neconomy .  SSA may rely on descriptions of occupations  from reliable sources of job\\ninformation to determine how occupations are generally  performed. A vocational specialist\\nor vocational expert may also provide information about how an occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .\\nIn determining  whether an individual can perform a job as actually  performed, an\\nindividual’s job may have involved functional demands that are different from those\\ngenerally  required for the occupation throug hout the national economy . If the individual\\ncannot meet the functional demands actually  required in the former job but can meet the\\nfunctional demands as generally  required throug hout the economy, we will find the\\nindividual able to perform PRW  and not disabled.\\n8.How do we obtain evidence concerning an individual’s work history?\\nAn individual is the primary  source for infor mation concerning  their work history , but we\\nconsider all available evidence and information. Statements by the individual about their past\\nwork are generally  sufficient for deter mining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. If the individual cannot give us all the information we need, we may\\ntry, with the individual’s permission, to get it from their employ er or another person who\\nknows about the individual’s work, such as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nWe will ask the individual to tell us about all of the work they did in the last 5 years (unless\\nthe job started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days). The individual must tell us the\\ndates they worked, the duties they performed, and any tools, machinery , and equipment they\\nused. We will need to know the amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing\\nthe individual did during  the workday , as well as any  other phy sical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\n9.What information do we require when determining whether work is PRW  that an individual\\ncan perform?\\nThis may include detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental demands,\\nand other job requirements. Information concerning  dates work was performed, tools and\\nmachines used, the extent of supervision required, and a descrip tion of tasks and\\nresponsibilities, may be needed to determine whether the work is PRW  that the individual\\ncan perform. If more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, SSA will request\\nseparate descriptions of each job the individual performed during  the relevant period. SSA\\nwill g ive careful consideration to:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no long er be met\\nand the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those requirements;\\n•the individual’s RFC (20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 and 416.945 and SSR 96-8p Assessing\\nResidual Functional Capacity in Initial Claims );  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corroborative information from other sources on the\\nxvi\\nrequirements of the work as actually  performed by the individual or as generally\\nperformed in the economy .\\n10. What findings and rationale must our determination or decision include when we find an\\nindividual is able to perform PRW ?\\nA determination or decisio n that an individual is not disabled, based on their ability  to\\nperform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess, must contain adequate rationale and finding s.\\nIn finding  that an individual has the capacity  to perform PRW , the determination or decision\\nmust:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the individual\\nactually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in the national\\neconomy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally  performed in\\nthe national economy .\\nSSR 24-1p - HOW WE APPLY  MEDICAL-V OCATIONAL PROFILES\\nEffective June 22, 2024, Social Security  Ruling  , How We Apply Medical-Voc ational Profiles,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63, Medical-Vocational Profiles Showing an Inability to Make an\\nAdjustment to Other Work.  See 2024 WL 3291789 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48477 (June\\n6, 2024).  This ruling  explains how SSA applies the three medical-vocational profiles: (1) arduous\\nunskilled work profile;  (2) no work profile; and (3) lifetime commitment profile – in establishing\\ndisability  under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act and SSA’s implementing  regulations. \\n \\nThese three profiles repres ent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  While former SSR 82-63 addressed the first two profiles, the\\nlifetime commitment profile was addressed in SSR 85-15, but only as it pertained to claimants with\\nvisual impairments.2  This profile was  incorporated into POMS DI 25010.001, which broadened the\\nrequirements and is not limited to claimants with visual impairments.  The lifetime commitment \\nprofile is now, for the first time, fully  addressed in a ruling .       \\n2 SSR 85- 15 pr ovides that:\\na finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant’s\\nvocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education\\nor less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work\\nin which good vision is essential.\\nxvii\\nSSR   is set up in a “question and answer” format, and answers the following  questions:\\n1.When do we consider the medical-vocational profiles in the sequential evaluation process?\\nSSA will use SSR  on and after its applicable d ate in any case in which the agency makes\\na determination or decision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for\\nfurther administrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR , SSA will apply  this\\nruling  to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the court’s remand. An\\nindividual can only  be found disabled based on a medical-vocational profile if a finding  at\\nstep four has been made that they do not have or are unable to perform their PRW .  At step\\nfive, an adjudicator must consider whether a medical-vocational profile applies before using\\nthe medical-vocational g uidelines.\\n2.What are the requirements of the arduous unskilled work profile?\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is not working at SGA level (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1510, 404.1572, 416.910 and\\n416.072); \\n•has a history of 35 years or more of arduous unskilled work (see 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1568 and 416.968); \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s) (see\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1522 and 416.922); and \\n•has no more than a marg inal education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564 and 416.964). \\n \\nSSR 24-1p notes that “marg inal education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills which are needed to do simple, unskilled types of jobs, and that generally\\nSSA considers that formal schooling  at a 6th grade level or less is a marg inal education.\\nHowever, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not reflect their\\nactual educational abilities.  See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b). The ruling  also\\ncites to SSR 20-1p: Titles II and XVI: How We Determine an Individual’s Education\\nCategory , which is discussed, infra  at xxxi.  \\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is used for an individual whose work experience includes\\nvery short periods of semi-skilled or skilled work, as long as the individual did not acquire\\nany transferable skills from those periods of work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1568 and 416.968.\\nSSA considers occupations with specific vocational preparation (“SVP”) levels one and two\\nto be unskilled, three and four to be semi-skille d, and five or greater to be skilled.  See\\nPOMS DI 25015.015 Work Experience as a Vocational Factor , and DOT Appendix  C.  See\\nalso SSR 00-4p Use of Vocational Expert and Vocational Specialist Evidence , and Other\\nReliable Occupational Informati on in Disability  Decisions.  See pages 69, infra, for a\\ndiscussion of SVP levels. The ruling also cites to SSR 82-41: Work Skills and Their\\nTransferability as Intended by the Expanded Vocational Factors Regulations for additional\\ninformation about how SSA considers skills from past work under its rules.  See page 122,\\ninfra , for a discussion of SSR 82-41.  \\nxviii\\nThe arduous unskilled work profile is also used for an individual whose work experience\\nincludes longer periods of semi-skilled or skilled work if the skill(s) acquired is not readily\\ntransferable to lig hter work.  \\nSSR 24-1p defines arduous work as physical work requir ing a high level of streng th or\\nendurance.  Arduous work does not have to involve any specific physical action or exertional\\nlevel, but it will usually , but not alway s, involve physical demands that we would classify\\nas heavy  or very heavy  based on the individual’s description of their past work. See 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1567 and 416.967.  Work that SSA would not classify  as heavy  or very heavy\\nmay still be considered arduous if, for example, it demands a great deal of stamina or if it\\ninvolves activity  such as repetitive bending  and lifting at a very fast pace.  An adjudicator\\nmust evaluate the record to make the ultimate finding  as to whether an individual’s work\\nmeets this criterion.\\n3.What are the requirements of the no work profile, and do we consider an individual’s RFC\\nwhen determining whether an individual meets this profile?\\nThe no work profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other work for an\\nindividual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education ( see 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964).\\n,\\nSSR 24-1p provides that SSA adjudicators do not need to assess or consider RFC when\\napply ing the no work profile.  The ruling  notes that for individuals aged 72 and older, SSA\\nconsiders any medically  determinable physical or mental impairment(s) that meet s the\\nduration requirement to be a severe impairment, citing  to SSR 03-3p: Policy Interpretation\\nRuling — Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Disability and Blindness in Initial Claims for\\nIndividuals 65 or Older  and citing  to SSR 23-1p:  Titles II and XVI: Duration Requirement\\nfor Disability , discussed infra at xx, as to the duration requirement.\\nSSR 24-1p states that “limited education” means ability  in reasoning , arithmetic, and\\nlanguage skills, but not enoug h to allow an individual with these educational qualifications\\nto do most of the more complex  job duties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.  Generally ,\\nSSA considers a 7th grade throug h the 11th grade level of formal education is a limited\\neducation.  However, the numerical grade level an individual completed in school may not\\nreflect their actual educational abilities. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564(b) and 416.964(b); see\\nalso SSR 20-01p, How We Determine An Individual’s Education Category , discussed infra\\nat xxxi. \\n4.What are the requirements of the lifetime commitment profile, and how does the lifetime\\ncommitment profile apply to an individual who has worked at multiple jobs or for multiple\\nemployers?\\nSSR 24-1p states that the lifetime commitment profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nxix\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older) ( see 20 C.F.R. §§ 1563\\nand 416.963); \\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level;\\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s). \\nFor purposes of the lifetime commitment profile, the individual’s 30 years o f work do not\\nhave to have been at only one job or for only one employ er.  The jobs must have been in one\\nfield of work, meaning  that the types of work the individual performed must have been very\\nsimilar to one another.  Use of this medical-vocational profile is appropriate even if the\\nindividual has work experience in a field(s) other than the one in which they have a 30-year\\nlifetime commitment, as long as the work experience in the other field(s) is not PRW  that\\nthe individual is still able to perform considering  their RF C.\\nSSR 23-1p - DURATION REQUIREMENT FOR DISABILITY\\nEffective November 7, 2023, Social Security  Ruling 23-1p, Duration Requirement for Disability ,\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-52, regarding  the duration of the impairment. The ruling  explains how\\nthe duration requirement is measured and defined, how it affects the sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess, and how SSA makes a finding  about the expected duration of an impairment. It addresses\\nhow duration is considered in continuing  disability  review cases when the beneficiary  or recipient\\nhas a new, severe medically  determined physical or mental impairment. It explains what will happen\\nif SSA learns of a return to substantial gainful employ ment within 12 months of a claimant’s onset\\nof disability . See 2023 W L 8236247 (S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023). \\nSSR 23-1p is set up in “question and answer” format and answers the following  questions: \\n1.How does a claimant meet the duration requirement for disability ? \\n2.What is a medically  determinable impairment (MDI ) that “can be expected to result in\\ndeath”?  \\n3.What do we mean by  “12 continuous months” and how do we measure it in initial claims?\\n4.How does the duration requirement affect  the five-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess?  \\n5.How does the duration requiremen t affect the three-step sequential disability  evaluation\\nprocess for Title XVI  claimants who have not y et attained 18 y ears of ag e? \\n6.How do we consider the duration requirement when the claimant has new, severe MDI (s)\\nin continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases?  \\n7.What if we find that the claimant meets the duration  requirement based on an expectation\\nof continued severity , but the claimant returned to SGA within 12 months?  \\nxx\\nSSR 22-1p AND SSR 22-2P ADDRESSING FRAUD AND \\nSIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS \\n(formerly SSR 16-1p and 16-2p) \\nEffective May 17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p addressing Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and rescinded and replaced SSR 16-2p, addressing  the\\nEvaluation of Claims Involving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-\\n2p. Each of these new ruling s chang e the evidentiary  standard from “preponderance of the evidence”\\nto “reason to believe” and provide that before SSA will disreg ard evidence under the Act at the\\nhearing s level of the administrative review process,  the individual’s objection to the disreg arding\\nof that evidence will be considered, among  other chang es more fully discussed in the arguments\\nregarding  the new ruling s, infra, at pag es 238-47. \\nSSA stated in issuing  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p that the agency expects that these revised\\nprocedures will allow implementation of relevant sections of the Social Security  Act in a manner\\nconsistent with the decisions of the Courts of Appeals that have considered legal challeng es to the\\nprocedures outlined in former SSR 16-1p and SSR 16-2p. These challeng es were based on principles\\nof constitutional due process and the Administrative Procedure Act, as discussed in the detailed\\ndescriptions of these ruling s, infra  at pag es 238-47.\\nREGULATORY  CHANGE OF  THE DEFINITION OF PAST RELEV ANT WORK BY\\nREDUCING THE RELE VANT PERIOD FROM 15 Y EARS TO FIV E YEARS \\nThe SSA has issued a final rule effective June 8, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to the Disability\\nAdjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work, 89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024). \\nThe effective date was subsequently  deferred to June 22, 2024. See 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).  The rule revises the definition of past relevant work (PRW ) by reducing  the relevant work\\nperiod from the current 15 years to five years.  The rule notes that this often reduces the number of\\njobs in an individual’s work history  that SSA will consider at step four of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess when determining  whether an individual can perform PRW .  On J une 25, 2024, SSA also\\nissued Emerg ency Messag e 24028, providing supplemental instructions for res judicata policy\\napplication, considering  the chang e to the regulatory  definition of past relevant work, discussed infra\\nat xxiii.\\nAt step five, this revision will also change the previous work experience that SSA will consider\\nunder the Medical-Vocational Guidelines.  Because a step four finding  can result in a denial but not\\nan allowance, SSA anticipates making  proportionally  fewer denial decisions at step four and\\nproportionally  more decisions at step five and expects that shifting  decisions from step four to step\\nfive with less past work considered will result in more allowance decisions. \\nThis final rule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability  review\\n(CDR) cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial disabil ity sequential\\nevaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no longer consider past work that started and\\nstoppe d in fewer than 30 calendar days to be PRW .  The rule also notes that in the Notice of\\nProposed Rule Making  (NPRM) for this rule, SSA proposed to remove a current sentence in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a) and 416.965(a) that explains the intent of the work experience rules is to\\nxxi\\n“ensure that remote work experience is not currently  applied” in order to reflect that the arduous\\nunskilled work profile and the lifetime commitment profile consider work history  for a period long er\\nthan the proposed five year relevant work period; the final rule notes this chang e was made in 88\\nFed. Reg . 83877 (Dec. 1, 2023).  \\nSSA makes these revisions in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and 416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years that was substantial\\ngainful activity  and that lasted long  enoug h for you to learn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We\\nwill not consi der work to be past relevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than\\n30 calendar day s (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consid er past relevant work and work experience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar\\ndays means a period of 30 consecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day\\nof work.  When we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or day s worked during  that period, or whether the work\\nwas full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days requir ement is separate from the\\nconsideration of substantial gainful activity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn\\nhow to do the work, althoug h the work performed during  the 30 calenda r days may count\\ntoward the time needed for y ou to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar days requirement\\nalso applies if you were self-employ ed or an independent contractor; we will consider\\nwhether you were engaged in the same type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual\\nwork assig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a): \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565(a), 4 16.965(a) from the prior text, “If you\\nhave no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for brief periods of time during  the\\nfive-y ear period, we generally  consider that these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as,\\n“If you have no work experience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear period, we\\ngenerally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the justification for the rule is to\\nallow individuals to focus on the most current and relevant information about their past\\nwork, better reflect the current evidence base on chang es over time in worker skill decay  and\\njob responsi bilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service, and reduce the\\nburden on individuals. \\nNew  SSR 24-2p and Rescissions : Pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-2p - Titles\\nII and XVI: How We Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effective June 22, 2024, which rescinds SSR 86-\\n8, and rescinds and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose of SSR 24-2p is to explain\\nhow SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform\\nthe demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy  set forth in SSA’s\\nregulations so that those regulations will be consi stently applied. See SSR 24-2p –  How We\\nEvaluate Past Relevant Work, 2024 WL 3291790 (S.S.A. June 6, 2024); 89 Fed. Reg. 48479 (June\\n6, 2024), discussed at pag es xiv-xvii, supra . \\nxxii\\nNew  SSR 24-1p and Rescissions: Also pursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued new SSR 24-1p,\\nTitles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Voca tional Profiles , effective June 22, 2024, which\\nrescinds and replaces SSR 82-63 .  The purpose of SSR  24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the\\nthree medical-vocational profiles - (1) arduous unskilled work profile; (2)  no work profile; and (3)\\nlifetime commitment profile. These profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age,\\neducation, and work experience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them\\nwill be found to be unable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process\\nwithout reference to the medical-vocational guidelines. The ruling  describes the profiles as follows:\\n1.Arduous unskilled work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a history  of 35 y ears or more of arduous unskilled work; \\n•can no longer perform this past arduous work because of a severe impairment(s); and\\n•has no more than a marg inal education.\\n \\n2.No work profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an adjustment to other\\nwork for an individual who: \\n•is ag e 55 or older; \\n•has a severe impairment(s); \\n•has no PRW  or no work in the previous five y ears; and\\n•has no more than a limited education.  \\n3.Lifetime commitment profile: This profile demonstrates the inability  to make an\\nadjustment to other work for an individual who: \\n•is closely  approaching  retirement ag e (i.e., age 60 or older);\\n•has no more than a limited education;\\n•is not working  at SGA level; \\n•has a lifetime commitment (30 years or more) to a field of work that is unskilled, or\\nthat is skilled or semi-skilled but provided no transferable skills; and\\n•can no long er perform this past work because of a severe impairment(s).\\nSSR 24-1p, Titles II and XVI: How We Apply Medical-Vocational Profiles , 2024 WL 3291789\\n(S.S.A.

See, Intermediate Improvement to the Disability Adjudication Process, Including\\nHow We Consider Past Work; Deferral of Effective Date , 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5,\\n2024).\\nThe EM notes that the new PRW  rule provides a new and less restrictive definition of PRW ,\\nsee 20 C.F.R. § 404.1560(b)(1), and SSR 24-2p. The new definition is less restrictive in two\\nways:  (1) The relevant period conside rs 5 years rather than 15 years of past work, and (2)\\nWork that started and stopped within 30 calendar day s is not PRW .\\n2.Adm inistrative Res Judicata\\nThe EM notes that administrative res judicata policy  provides that once an issue is decided,\\nit does not need to be decided again.  Res judicata is applied at all levels of the adjudication\\nprocess to avoid deciding  an issue that has previously  been decided based on the same facts,\\nsame issues, same parties, and same adjudicative period and is applicable only with respect\\nto the period covered by the prior final determination or decision.  The end of this period will\\ngenerally  correspond to the date of the prior final determination or decision, except when the\\ndate the claimant last met the non-disability  requirements for entitlement expired prior to the\\ndate of the final determination or decision.\\n3. Policy\\nThe EM announ ces SSA will not apply  res judicata to bar readjudication of a previously\\nadjudicated period when the prior final determination or decision finding  the claimant not\\ndisabled is dated prior to June 22, 2024, if the prior adverse determination or decision found\\nthe individual could do:  \\n1) PRW at step four of the sequential evaluation process and the PRW  cited is not PRW\\nunder the PRW  rule; OR\\n2)Other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process , work experience was\\nmaterial to the decision, and the individual’s work experience is different under the PRW\\nrule.\\nWhen these criteria are met, SSA will not apply  res judicata to deny  a subsequent claim or\\ndismiss a request for hearing  on that claim.\\nThe EM provides procedures and g uidance for SSA staff in implementing  this policy .4\\n4Editor’s Note: In the limited circumstances where a case has received a final determination, and the new\\nPRW rules would have resulted in a favorable outcome, representatives may wish to consider filing a new\\napplication instead of additional appeals in light of EM- 24028.  In the new application, a claimant could\\npursue an alleged onset date that predates the prior denial without the restriction of res judicata.

The purpose of the new\\nruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether an individual retains the residual functional\\ncapacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their past relevant work (PRW ) and to explain the policy\\nset forth in SSA’s regulations  so that those regulations will be consistently  applied. Among  other\\nmatters, SSR 24-2p revises the definition of PRW  by reducing  the relevant work period from fifteen\\nyears to five years.

The purpose of SSR 24-1p is to explain how SSA applies the three\\nmedical-vocational profiles - arduous unskilled work, no work, and lifetime commitment. \\nThese profiles represent combinations of the vocational factors of age, education, and work\\nexperience that are so unfavorable that an individual who meets one of them will be found to be\\nunable to adjust to other work at step five of the sequential evaluation process without reference to\\nthe medical-vocational guidelines.

See SSR 23-1p  – Duration Requirement for Disability , 2023 WL 236247\\n(S.S.A. Nov. 7, 2023).  The new ruling ’s purpose is to update and consolidate SSA policy  regarding\\nthe duration requirement for establishing  disability ; considering  that since SSR 82-52 was published,\\nSSA has “revised several rules and issued policy  guidance that leave the original ruling  misalig ned\\nwith current regulatory  authority  and policy  guidance.  For instance, we chang ed the sequential\\nevaluation process for widows and Title XVI children; established the process for evaluating\\nmedical impro vement in continuing  disability  review (CDR) cases; instituted multiple work\\nincentives for recipients of Title XVI payments; and extended the reentitlement period for Title II\\nclaims.” (footnotes omitted).  \\nxxx\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 16-1P – FRAUD AND SIMILAR FAULT REDETERMINATIONS\\nAND SSR 16-2P – THE EV ALUATION OF CLAIMS INV OLVING THE ISSUE OF\\nSIMILAR FAULT IN THE PROVIDING OF EV IDENCE  \\nEffective May  17, 2022, SSA rescinded and replaced SSR 16-1p pertaining  to Fraud and Similar\\nFault Redeterminations with SSR 22-1p and SSR 16-2p pertaining  to the Evaluation of Claims\\nInvolving the Issue of Similar Fault in the Providing of Evidence with SSR 22-2p.  See 2022 WL\\n2533116-17 (S.S.A. May 17, 2022).

The ruling  went into effect on April 27, 2020, the same day  new reg ulations\\nwere issued which removed “inability  to communicate in English” as an education categ ory. See 85\\nFed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020). Now SSA will have four education categ ories at step five of the\\nsequential evaluation process:\\n1)High school education and above – “abilities in reasoning , arithmetic, and language\\nskills acquired throug h formal schooling  at a 12th grade level or above” which generally\\npermits performance of semi-skilled throug h skilled work.\\n2)Limited education – some reasoning , arithmetic, and language skills abilities acquired\\nthroug h a 7th – 11th grade education, but not enoug h for “most of the more complex  job\\nduties needed in semi-skilled or skilled jobs.”\\n3)Marginal education – reasoning,  arithmetic, and language skills abilities needed for\\nsimple, unskilled jobs, g enerally  a 6th grade education or less.\\n4)Illiteracy – defined as “an inability to read or write” even simple messag es like\\ninstructions or inventory  lists even thoug h the person can sign his or her name. Generally\\nxxxi\\nhas little or no formal schooling .\\nSSR 20-01p also acknowledg es that other evidence may show a higher or lower level of education\\nthan formal schooling  level would suggest. Examples of the evidence used are “past work\\nexperien ce, the kind of responsibility  an individual may have had when working , daily  activities,\\nhobbies, results of testing , community  projects,” and vocational training . Another factor that SSA\\nmay consider is an extensive history  of special education, which can show in a particular case that\\nthe individual’s educational abilities are lower than the grade completed.  This ruling  amends the\\nfollowing  regulations:  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964 and 20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –\\nMedical-Vocational Guidelines\\nHEARINGS HELD BY  ADMINISTRATIV E APPEALS JUDGES\\nOF THE APPEALS COUNCIL\\n \\nUnder a final rule, effective December 16, 2020, SSA revised its rules to clarify  when and how\\nadministrative appeals judges (AAJ) on the Appeals Council may hold hearing s and issue decisions.\\nSee Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council , 85 F ed. Reg . 73138\\n(Nov. 16, 2020). Prior to the rule, the Appeals Council already  had the authority  to hold hearing s\\nand issue decisions under the existing  statute and regulations, but SSA had not exercised this\\nauthor ity or explained the circumstances under which it would be appropriate for the Appeals\\nCouncil to assume responsibility  for holding  a hearing  and issuing  a decision. \\nThe clarifications made by the rule ensure the Appeals Council is not limited in the type of claims\\nfor which it may hold hearing s. The stated goal of the rule is to increase adjudicative capacity  when\\nneeded, allowing  quicker adjustment to fluctuating  short-term workloads, such as when an influx\\nof cases reaches the hearing s level. The final rule amends or revises the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456 (Rem oval of a hearing request(s) to the Appeals\\nCouncil)  provides that the “Appea ls Council may assume responsibility  for a hearing\\nrequest(s) pending  at the hearing  level of the administrative review process” and requires\\nsending  a “notice to all parties that the Appeals Council has assumed responsibility  for the\\ncase(s).” The Appeals Council is required to conduct all proceeding s in accordance with 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, applicab le to SSDI  claims and 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461, applicable to SSI claims.  Appeals Council review may be requested by any party\\ndissatisfied with the hearing  decision or with the dismissal of a hearing  request, following\\nthe procedures in §§ 404.967 throug h 404.982 for SSDI  claims and §§ 416.1429 throug h\\n416.1461 for SSI claims.  The Appeals Council may also decide on its own motion to review\\nthe action that was taken under § 404.969. The administrative appeals judge who conducted\\na hearing , issued a hearing  decision, or dismissed a hearing  request will not participate in\\nany action associated with the request for Appeals Council review of that case. 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.983, 416.1483 (Case remanded by a Federal court)  provides that when\\na Federal court remands a case to the Commissioner for further consideration, one option\\nlisted in the regulations is for the Appeals Council to schedule a hearing. The Appeals\\nCouncil may  take any  of these actions: \\nxxxii\\n•make a decision either without a hearing ; \\n•make a decision with a hearing ; \\n•dismiss the proceeding s, ex cept in limited circumstances; or \\n•remand the case to an ALJ “with instructions to take action and issue a decision or\\nreturn the case to the Appeals Council with a recommended decision.\\n If the Appeals Council assumes responsibility  for issuing  a decision and “a hearing  is\\nnecessary  to complete adjudication of the claim(s), an administrative appeals judge will hold\\na hearing  using  the procedures set forth in §§ 404.929 throug h 404.961, as applicable.”  See\\n20 C.F .R.§§ 416.1429 throug h 416.1461, for the reg ulations applicable to SSI  claims. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.984, 416.1484 (Appeals Council review  of hearing decision in a case\\nremanded by a Federal court)  provi des that the decision of the ALJ or administrative\\nappeals judge will become the final decision of the Commissioner after remand unless the\\nAppeals Council assumes jurisdiction of the case based on written exceptions to the decision\\nfiled with the Appeals Council or based on its authority  to hold a hearing . If no ex ceptions\\nare filed and the Appeals Counc il does not assume jurisdiction, the decision of the\\nadministrative law judg e or administrative appeals judg e becomes the final decision of the\\nCommissioner after remand. \\nREMOV ING “INABILITY  TO COMMUNICATE\\nIN ENGLISH” AS AN EDUCATION CATEGORY\\nThis final rule became effective April 27, 2020 and  eliminates the education categ ory “inability  to\\ncommunicate in English” when SSA evaluates disability  claims for adults under titles  II and XVI\\nof the Social Security  Act. See 85 Fed. Reg. 10586 (Feb. 25, 2020).  The preamble explains that this\\neducation category is no longer a useful indicator of an individual’s educational attainment or of the\\nvocational impact of an individual’s education because of chang es in the national workforce since\\nadoption of the prior rule more than 40 years ago and that these revisions “will help us better assess\\nthe vocational impact of education in the disability determination process.”  Id.  This final rule\\namends the following  regulations:  \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1564, 416.964  – Your education as a vocational factor\\n20 C.F .R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2 –  Medical-Vocational Guidelines      \\nSETTING THE MANNER FOR THE APPEARA NCE OF\\nPARTIES AND WITNESSES AT A HEARING\\nThis final rule became effective January  17, 2020 and sets the time, place, and manner of appearance\\nfor hearing s at the administrative law judge (ALJ) level of SSA’s administrative review process,\\nwith modifications. It states that SSA will determine how parties and witnesses will appear at a\\nhearing  before an ALJ and will set the time and place for the hearing  according ly. Parties to a\\nhearing  will be scheduled to appear by video teleconference (VTC), in person, or, in limited\\ncircumstances, by telephone. Under this final rule, SSA will decide how parties and witnesses will\\nappear at a hearing  based on several factors, but the parties to a hearing will continue to have the\\nxxxiii\\nability  to opt out of appearing  by VTC at the AL J hearing s level. The F inal Rule ex plains:\\nFinally , we are revising  our rule to state that, at the ALJ hearing  level, if we need to\\nsend an  amended notice of hearing , or if we need to schedule a supplemental\\nhearing , we will send the amended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  at least\\n20 days before the date of the hearing . The date of hearing  indicated in the\\namended notice or notice of supplemental hearing  will be at least 75 day s from the\\ndate we first sent the claimant a notice of hearing , unless the claimant has waived his\\nor her rig ht to advance notice. \\nThis final rule modifies the following  regulatory  sections:\\n§§ 404.929, 416.1429 – Hearing  before an administrative law  judg e - general.\\n§§ 404.936, 416.1436 – Time and place for a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.938, 416.1438 – Notice of a hearing  before an administrative law judg e.\\n§§ 404.950, 416.1450 – Presenting  evidence to a hearing  before an administrative law judge.\\n§§ 404.976, 416.1476  – Procedures before the Appeals Council on  review.\\nSee 84 F ed. Reg . 69298 (Dec. 18, 2019).  \\nREVISED MEDICAL CRITERIA FOR EV ALUATING\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS\\nAs part of its ongoing review of the Listings, SSA developed these final rules, effective April 2,\\n2021, to revise the criteria in the Listing  of Impairments that are used to evaluate claims involving\\nmusculoskeletal disorders in adults and children under titles II and XVI of the Social Security  Act,\\nto update the medical criteri a and clarify  how it evaluates musculoskeletal disorders. SSA also\\nmakes a conforming  chang e to the endocrine disorders body  system to comport with the chang e it\\nproposed to 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m) to be consistent with these final rules.  The new functional\\ncriteria include:\\n1.A documented medical need for a walker, two canes, or two crutches or a wheeled and\\nseated mobility  device (WSMD) (such as a manual wheelchair) involving  the use of both\\nhands, or\\n2. An inability  to use one upper extremity  to independently  initiate, sustain, and complete\\nwork-related activities4F  5 involving  fine and gross movements, and a documente d\\nmedical need for a one-handed, hand-held assistive device that requires the use of your\\nother upper extremity  or a WSMD involving  the use of one hand (such as a powered\\nwheelchair), or\\n3. An inability  to use both upper extremities to the extent that neither can be used to\\nindependently  initiate, sustain, and complete work-related activities5 involving  fine and\\ngross movements.\\nThese criteria represent the level of dysfunction for upper and lower extremities that would cause\\nxxxiv\\nan adult to be unable to work or a child to be unable to perform age-appropriate activities. Assistive\\ndevices are considered as part of the first and second functional criteria in the musculoskeletal\\ndisorders listing s. These final rules also:\\n•Eliminate the requirement that there must be a prescription for an assistive device;\\n•Differentiate between patholog ic fractures and fractures caused by a traumatic even t\\nbecause the medical treatment and recovery  expectations for fractures differs, depending\\non the underly ing cause;  \\n•Acknowledg e the rapid development of motor function during  the infant and toddler\\nstages by  adding  a child listing  for evaluating  musculoskeletal disorders of infants and\\ntoddlers, from birth to attainment of ag e 3, with developmental motor \\n•Revise the content and structure of the current listing s to incorporate the new functional\\ncriteria into each listing ;\\n•Add specific sections in the introductory  text to provide g uidance on each listing ;\\n•Emphasize the current policy  that a musculoskeletal disorder may meet or medicall y\\nequal one of these listing s regardless of whether the person was prescribed opioid\\nmedication, or whether the person was prescribed opioid medication and did not follow\\nthis prescribed treatment; and\\n•Make conforming  chang es to the relevant criteria in the cardiovascular, endocrine, and\\nimmune disorders body  systems since those body  systems use terminology from the\\ncurrent musculoskeletal disorders listing  that are revised in these final rules.\\nThese final rules amend 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 – Listing  of Impairments\\nMusculoskeletal Disorders and 20 C.F.R. § 416.926a(m), addressing  functional equivalence in\\nchildren.  See 85 Fed. Reg . 78164 (Dec 3, 2020). \\n2019 CHANGES IN TH E LAW \\n2019 RULING S: \\nIn 2019, the Social Security  Administration (SSA) published four Social Security  Rulings (SSR): \\nSSR 19-1p addressing  the effect of the Supreme Court decision in  Lucia v. SEC on cases pending\\nat the Appeals Council; SSR 19-2p, addressing  the evaluation of cases involving  obesity ; SSR 19-\\n3p, addressing  requesting  reconsideration and hearing  either by paper or electronically ; and SSR 19-\\n4p, evaluating  cases involvi ng primary  headache disorders.  Highlights of the 2019 ruling s are\\nbelow. \\nSSR 19-1p – EFFECT OF THE DECISION IN LUCIA V . SEC \\nON CASES PENDING AT THE APPEALS COUNCIL  \\nSSR 19-1p explains how SSA will adjudicate cases pending  at the Appeals Council (AC) in which\\nthe claimant has raised a timely  challeng e to the appointment of an administrative law judge (ALJ)\\nunder the Appointments Clause of the United States Const itution in light of the Supreme Court’s\\nxxxv\\ndecision in Lucia v. SEC, 138 S. Ct. 2044 (2018).  As set forth in Policy Net EM-18003 REV 2 ,1 if\\na claimant or representative files a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e and timely  requests\\nAppeals Council review, the AC will consider the challeng e in the contex t of the facts of the case\\n(including , but not limited to, the date of the ALJ decision and the date the challeng e was raised)\\nin determining  whether there is a basis to g rant review.  \\nThe AC will determine whether granting  review is appropriate under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970 or\\n416.1470, or both, when considering  both the decision on the merits and any potentially  unresolved\\nAppointments Clause issues.  In those matters where a timely  Appointments Clause challeng e to an\\nALJ decision issued prior to J uly 16, 2018 is raised to the Appeals Council in a proper request for\\nreview, the AC will g rant review and issue a decision or order remand, as appropriate.2\\nSSR 19-2P –  EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING OBESITY\\nSSR 19-2p provides g uidance on how SSA establishes that a person has a medically  determinable\\nimpairment of obesity  and how SSA evaluates obesity  in disability  claims.  The new SSR reflects\\nthe chang es to the rules SSA has published, and advances in medical knowledg e, since publication\\nof SSR 02-1p, which is repealed.  SSR 19-2p is discussed in more detail in this publication, under\\n“Specific I mpairments.”  \\nSSR 19-3P –  REQUESTING RECONSIDERATION OR HEARING\\nBY AN ADMINISTRATIV E LAW JUDGE\\nSSR 19-3p explains the two options available to claimants appealing  SSA determinations that they\\nare not disabled based on medical factors.  This SSR explains both the paper and electronic options\\nfor requesting  reconsideration or a hearing  by an ALJ, and the similarities and differences between\\nthese two options.  Until recent years, the only way for claimants to request an appeal was to use the\\npaper-based option, which consists of paper appeal forms.  SSA developed an electronic appeals\\nsystem, called iAppeals.  This SSR explains the differences between the paper and electronic appeal\\nprocedure s for filing  a request for reconsideration or a hearing .  A claimant may file a “written\\nrequest” for appeal using  either the paper-based appeals process or iAppeals.  With the iAppeals\\noption the claimant must submit all of the needed information at once.  It is therefore the equivalent\\nof a combined request  and disability  report.  As noted in the ruling , an iAppeals offers several\\nconvenient flex ibility  for claimants: \\n•letting  claimants leave questions blank if inapplicable; \\n•allowing  claimants to indicate that additional time is needed to collect specific evidence;\\nand\\n•enabling  claimants to partially  complete an electronic appeal application, save it, and\\nfinish it later.\\nAfter a claimant files an appeal, he or she can submit evidence by fax, by mail, or in-person at a\\n1 See https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/reference.nsf/links/08062018021025PM( Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n2This ruling is not further discussed as the date to raise the issue to the Appe als Council has passed. \\nxxxvi\\nfield or hearing  office.  However, if using  the iAppeals option, the claimant has an option to upload\\nand simultaneously  submit evidence with the electronic appeal. \\nSSR 19-4P - EV ALUATING CASES INV OLVING PRIMARY  HEADACHE DISORDERS\\nSSR 19-4p: Effective August 26, 2019, SSR 19-4p prov ides guidance on how to establish that a\\nperson has a medically  determinable impairment of a primary  headache disorder and how to evaluate\\nprimar y headache disorders in disability  claims.  The SSR evaluates claims involving  primary\\nheadache disorders in a question and answer format.  SSR 19-4p is discussed in more detail in this\\npublication, under “Specific I mpairments.”  \\n2018 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\n2018 RULING S:  \\nThe Social Security  Administration issued three new Social Security  Ruling s: SSR 18-01p  and\\nSSR 18-02p addressing  onset dates of disability  and SSR 18-3p , addressing  the failure to follow\\ntreatment.  See 83 Fed. Reg. 49613; 83 Fed. Reg. 49616; 83 Fed. Reg. 49621. SSR 18-01p  and\\n18-02p together rescind and replace SSR 83-20, pertaining  to the “Onse t of Disability ,” and\\nclarify  how SSA determines the established onset date (EOD) in disability  and blindness claims,\\nrespectively .  These two ruling s became applicable on October 2, 2018.  Highlights of the 2018\\nruling s, discussed in more detail in this publication, are below:  \\nSSR 18-01P – DETERMINING THE ESTABLISHED  ONSET DATE IN DISABILITY\\nCLAIMS  AND SSR 18-02P –  DETERMINING THE ONSET DATE\\n IN BLINDNESS CLAIMS\\nSSR 18-01p specifically  addresses how SSA determines the EOD in claims involving  “traumatic,\\nnontraumatic, and exacerbating and remitting  impairments . . . [as well as] special considerations\\nrelated to the EOD, such as work activity  and previously  adjudicated periods.”  It also clarifies that\\nan ALJ may, but is not required to, call upon a medical expert to assist with inferring  the claimant’s\\nEOD. SSR 18-02p addresses how SSA determines the EOD in statutory  blindness claims, with\\nspecific emphasis on the differences between disability  and blindness claims under the Act.\\nSSR 18-3P – FAILURE TO FOLLOW TREATMENT\\nSSR 18-3p, rescinds and replaces SSR 82–59, pertaining  to the “‘Failure to Follow Prescribed\\nTreatment,’‘ and provides guidance about how SSA applies its “failure to follow prescribed\\ntreatment policy  in disability  and blindness claims under Titles II and XVI” of the Act.  It applies\\nin all determinations and decisions made on or after October 29, 2018.\\nSSR 18-3p explains that SSA will only determine whether a claimant has failed to follow prescribed\\ntreatment when all three of the following  conditions ex ist:\\nxxxvii\\n•The individual would otherwise be entitled to benefits based on disability  or eligible for\\nblindness benefits under Titles I I or XVI  of the Act;\\n•[SSA has] evidence that an individual’s own medical source(s) prescribed treatment for\\nthe medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\"\n",

      "  \"context\": \"the medically  determinable impairment(s) upon which the disabilit y finding is based; and\\n•[SSA has]  evidence that the individual did not follow the prescribed treatment.\\nIf all three of these conditions exist, then SSA will make a failure to follow prescribed treatment\\ndetermina tion by assessing  “whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would be expected to\\nrestore the individual’s ability  to engage in SGA . . . [and]  whether the individual has good cause\\nfor not following  the prescribed treatment.”  The ruling  sets forth some examples of acceptable good\\ncause reasons for not following  the prescribed treatment, including  religion, cost, incapacity ,\\nmedical disag reement among  the claimant’s treating  sources, intense fear of surg ery, prior history\\nof unsuccessful results, high risk of loss of life or limb, and risk of addiction to opioid medication.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 05-02 PERTAINING TO \\nUNSUCCESSFUL WORK ATTEMPTS\\nOn May 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 05-02  pertaining  to unsuccessful work attempts as it was\\n“obsolete.” See 83 F ed. Reg . 22308 (May  14, 2018). As SSA ex plained:\\nOn February  28, 2005, we published  SSR 05-02, which provides guidance about\\ndetermining  whether substantial work activity  that is discontinued or reduced below\\na specified level may be considered an unsuccessful work attempt (UW A) under the\\ndisability  provisions of the law. SSR 05-02 explains the policies and procedures for\\nevaluating a work effort of 3 months or less and work efforts between 3 and 6\\nmonths.\\nOn October 17, 2016, we published final rules, Unsuccessful Work Attempts and\\nExpedited Reinstatement Eligibility , in the Federal Register at 81 FR 71367. These\\nrules, among  other thing s, removed some of the requirements for evaluation of an\\nUWA that lasts between 3 and 6 months. Specifically , the rules removed the\\nadditional conditions that we used when we evaluated a work attempt in employ ment\\nor self-employ ment that lasted between 3 and 6 months and provided that we now\\nuse one standard for work attempts lasting  6 months or less.\\nDue to these final rules and the resulting  simplification of our policies, SSR 05-02\\nis no longer correct. The final rules at 20 C.F.R. 404.1574(d), 404.1575( d),\\n416.974(c), 416.975(d) (unsuccessful work attempts) were effective November 16,\\n2016 . Consequently , we are rescinding  SSR 05-02 as obsolete. Notice of this\\nrescission is published in accordance with 20 C.F .R. 402.35(b)(1).\\nxxxviii\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 96-3P PERTAINING TO SEV ERITY  AND SSR 96-4P \\nPERTAINING TO MEDICALLY  DETERMINABLE IMPAIRMENTS\\nOn June 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 96-3p  which addressed “Considering  Alleg ations of Pain and\\nOther Symptoms in Determining  Whether a Medically  Determinable Impairment is Sever e” and\\nSSR  96-4p which addressed “Symptoms, Medically  Deter minable Physical and Mental\\nImpairments, and Exertional and Nonex ertional Limitations. See 83 Fed. Reg. 27816 (June 14,\\n2018). SSA explained that these  two ruling s are “unnecessarily  duplicative of SSR 16-3p” which\\naddresses “Evaluation of Sy mptoms in Disability  Claims,” effective March 28, 2016. Id.\\nAs SSA explained, SSR 16-3p is a “more comprehensive statement of our policy  on symptoms,\\nexplains how we evaluate the extent to which alleg ed symptoms limit an adult’s ability  to perform\\nwork-related activities and a child’s ability  to function effectively  in an age-appropriate manner.”\\nId. SSR 96-3p  “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” as SSR 16-3p  “explains that we will consider\\nsymptoms and functional limitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the\\nobjective medical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinab le impairment]  or\\ncombination of impairments that meets our duration requirement.” Id.\\nSSR 96-4p also “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” because “[i]n SSR 16-3p, we clarified that an\\nindividual’s symptoms alone are not enough to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled based on alleg ed symptoms\\nalone.” Id.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 82-59 PERTAINING TO FAILURE \\nTO FOLLOW PRESCRIBED TREATMENT AND \\nSSR 83-20 PERTAINING TO ONSET OF DISABILITY\\nSSR 82-59 addressing  “Failure to follow prescribed treatment was rescinded on October 29, 2018;\\nSee 2018 WL 4945641 (Oct. 2, 2018). It was replaced with SSR 18-3p. SSR 83-20 addressing\\n“Onset of disability ” was rescinded on Octobe r 2, 2018; See 2018 WL 4945639 (Oct. 2, 2018). It\\nwas replaced with SSR 18-01p (Determining  the established onset date in disability  claims) and 18-\\n02p (Determining  the established onset date in blindness claims).\\n2017 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\nREGULATORY RE VISIONS:  \\nIn a significant chang e, SSA substantially  revised its regulations pertaining  to medical evidence,\\neffective March 27, 2017.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5844 (Jan. 18, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg 15132 (Mar.. 27,\\n2017); 83 F ed. Reg . 51836 (Oct. 15, 2018).  As noted in the summary  of the final rules:\\nThe revisions include redefining  several key terms related to evidence, revising  our\\nrules about acceptable medical sources (AMS), revising  how we consider and\\narticulate our consideration of medical opinions and prior administrative medical\\nxxxix\\nfinding s, revising  our rules about medical consultants  (MC) and psycholog ical\\nconsulta nts (PC), revising  our rules about treating  sources, and reorg anizing our\\nevidence reg ulations for ease of use.\\n82 Fed. Reg. at 5844. The new regulations are effective for claims filed on March 27, 2017 and\\nafter.  The regulations in effect on March 26, 2017 apply for claims filed before March 27, 2017. \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1527, 417.927 (2019).  \\nHighlights of the new reg ulations include:\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the medical opinions of a claimant’s\\ntreating  sources. I nstead, medical opinions and prior administrative medical finding s\\nwill be evaluated equally  for “persuasiveness” based most importantly  on\\n“consistency ” and “supportability .”\\n•Physicians Assistants (PAs) and Advance Practice Reg istered Nurses (APRNs) are\\nnow included in the list of Acceptable Medical Sources (AMSs). L icensed\\naudiolog ists and optometrists can also be AMSs for certain purposes within the\\nscopes of their practices.\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the disability  decisions of other\\ngovernmental ag encies, including  the VA, but instead will consider and evaluate the\\nmedical evidence that was submitted to that ag ency  in support of that decision.\\n•SSA has rescinded SSR 96-2p, 96-5p, 96-6p and 06-03p and issued SSR 17-2p\\naddressing  finding s of medical equivalence. The rescissions apply  to all pending\\nclaims, including  claims filed before the rescissions . See  HAL LEX I -5-3-30.33\\nThese chang es are addressed in this publication.  Unfortunately , many  of these chang es are not\\nclaimant friendly , were driven by  data analy tics desig ned to produce fewer remands, and will\\nrequire more work on y our part to win cases.\\n33 HALLEX I-5-3-30 Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence. This new provision\\nhas important agency guidance concerning when to apply the new rules, protective filing date, evaluating\\nmedical evidence and subs equent applications.\\nxl\\nABOUT TH E AUTH OR\\nSarah H. Bohr has specializ ed in Social Security  law for over 40 years and, for the past 20 years,\\nhas had an appellate practice, writing  Social Security  federal court briefs.  Sarah is most proud of\\nher successful argument before the Supreme Court 24 years ago, in Sims v. Apfel,  530 U.S. 103\\n(2000).  Winning  Sims  turned out to be instrumental to the success of her career, as it has allowed\\nher to approach each federal appeal as a puzzle and to figure out the best issues to raise. In her\\ndisting uished career, she has worked in all areas of the practice of Social Security  law, from\\nadministrative representation, district court appeals (including  class action litigation), circuit court\\nappeals, to successfully  litigating  before the Supreme Court. \\nSarah is very proud of successfully  litigating  three key published Social Security  cases over the past\\nfour y ears:\\n• Arakas v.

Admin ., 61 F .4th 341 (4th Cir. 2023)\\nSarah obtained her B.A. from the Colleg e of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio and law degree from the\\nAntioch School of Law (later becoming  the District of Columbia School of Law).  Sarah learned\\nSocial Security  law while working  for 21 years as a legal services attorney  at Jacksonville Area\\nLegal Aid, Inc. (JALA). While at JALA, she successfully  litigated three published Eleventh Circuit\\ncases which are still cited by courts in 2024:  Myers v. Sullivan, 916 F.2d 659 (11th Cir. 1990);\\nStratton v. Bowen , 827 F.2d 1447 (11th Cir. 1987); and Flynn v. Heckler , 768 F.2d 1273 (11th Cir.\\n1986).

THE RECORD\\n_____ 1.The ALJ committed  reversible error by relying on an internet study  [or\\nmedical treatise or other non-record evidence]  to support his/her finding s.\\n_____ 2.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the post-hearing evidence submitted by the\\nclaimant to the record and to consider this evidence in rendering  his/her\\ndecision. \\n_____ 3.The ALJ erred in not providing  a complete exhibit list with the decision as\\nrequired by HAL LEX I-2-1-20(B )(3) when the decision is less than fully\\nfavorable. \\nI. LATE F ILING  OF THE REQUEST F OR REVIEW\\n_____  1. The Appeals Council should find good cause, as defined in 20 C.F .R. §§\\n404.911, 416.1411 for the claimant’s late filing  of his/her Request for Review.\\n_____ 2.The claimant’s failure to timely  request review should be excused in light of\\nhis/her mental impairments as discussed in SSR 91-5p. \\nJ. HEARING S BEF ORE THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n    _____ 1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral\\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n_____ 2.The Appeals Council erred by failing to notify claimant and his/her\\nrepresentati ve that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\n_____ 3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n_____ 4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issued a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nK.   SUBMISSION OF  NEW EVIDENCE TO THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n____   1. The new evidence enclos ed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J. \\n31\\n____   2. Even thoug h the evidence is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***]  and there is good cause for the failure to submi t the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n____  3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable proba bility that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decision, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\n____ 4.The Appeals Council failed to proffer to claimant evidence receive d from  a\\nsource, other than the claimant or their representative, associ ated with the\\nclaim(s) file.\\n____  5. The Appeals Council failed to offer a supplemental hearing with proffered\\nevidence when the AC granted review and issued a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision.\\n____ 6.The Appeals Council failed to consider the claim ant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving additional evidence, because the AC did not associate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\n____  7.The Appeals Council  must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice.\\n____ 8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request for review because the\\nreview denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\n_____ 9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nL.  SUBSEQUENT AP PLICATIONS \\n____  1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new \\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\n____ 2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim. \\n32\\n____  3.Submission of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\nM. RIGHT TO HEARING  BEFORE NEW ALJ\\n____ 1.in accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\n____ 2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeals Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.940 and 416.1440.\\nN.  DUTY TO F OLLOW AP PEALS COUNCIL REMAND ORDERS\\n____ 1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nO. ALJ BIAS, P REJUDICE, OR F AILURE TO F OLLOW P ROCEDURES\\n ____ 1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council  should issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\n____ 2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidence by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\n____ 3.The langu age of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decision as a forum to criticiz e [agency , agency\\npolicy  or procedure, other governmental agencies, the court,  the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] . \\n____ 4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.\\nP.  REDETERMINATIONS DUE TO FRAUD OR SIMILAR F AULT \\n____  1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n____   2.The ALJ’s finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar fault\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence. \\n33\\n ____  3.The ALJ failed to apply  the applicable standard for excluding evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable grounds to suspect, that\\nthe person knew the evidence provid ed was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n____  4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding  was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.\\n____  5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason] into\\naccount in exclud ing evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided.  \\n____ 6.The ALJ failed to comply with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermination of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p.  \\n____ 7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n____ 8.The notice of determination or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficient because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencie s prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision.  \\n34\\nSAMPLE ARGUMENTS\\nI. SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION PRO CESS ISSUE S4\\n  A. STEP  1 - SUB STANTIAL GAINFUL  ACT IVITY (SG A) \\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with SSR 83-33 in finding  that the claimant’s\\nemploy ment constitutes SGA.\\nApplic able law: SSR 83-33 indicates that earning s representing  the value of\\nthe work performed must be identified before consulting  the earning s\\nguidelines.5 Work will be considered SGA if it meets any of three tests. Only\\nthe first test is used, however, where income  is less than the specified\\nsecondary  guidelines amount unless there is some indication that an\\nindividual whose earning s presumably  indicate no SGA is nevertheless\\nperforming  SGA. Id. In accordance with SSR 94-1c, illegal activity  may\\nconstitute SGA.6\\nSSR 83-33 provides that work will be considered SGA if it meets one of three\\ntests. The first  test for employ ment focuses on countable earning s. The second\\nand third tests look to the comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired\\npeople in similar businesses/occu pations and to the worth of the work activity .\\nId. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in accordance with SSR 83-33 and\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574, 416.974.\\n4 Unde r the sequential evaluation process, the first step is to determine whether the claimant is engaging in\\nsubstantial gainful activity.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( b). If so, the claim is denied. If not, the second st ep is to\\ndetermine whether the claimant has a severe impairment, i.e., an impairment which significantly limits ability\\nto do basic work activities.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( c).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If a severe impairment\\nis present, the third step is to determine whether it meets or equals a listed impairment.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( d).  If it does, a finding of disability is directed.  Id.  If not, the fourth step is to determine whether\\nthe claimant has an impairment which precludes the performance of past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( e).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If so, the fifth step is to determine whether the claimant’s\\nimpairments prevent the performance of any other work, considering residual functional capacity, age,\\neducation, and work experience.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( f).  These regulations pertain to Social Security\\ndisability insurance cases. Identical regulations pertain to SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920( b).\\n5 The tiered earnings format was discontinued beginning in 2001. Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted each\\nyear, can be f ound a t: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed  Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n6 SSR 94-1c adopts the Seventh Circuit’s opinion rendered in Dotson v. Shal ala, 1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) ,\\nand introduces the opinion with a summary of this decision. This summary explains that the court held: (1)\\nillegal activity can constitute SGA, after noting nothing in the Act or regulations requires SGA t o be lawful\\nor recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purpo ses of determining SGA ; (2)  the\\nclaimant’s uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery he performed to suppo rt his $200- $300 per day\\ndrug habit provided substantial evidence to suppor t the ALJ’s finding that the claimant was engaged in SGA;\\n(3) the cost of the narcotics need not be deducted from his income as an IRWE;  and (4) the claimant raised\\nno meritorious due pr ocess or equal protection arguments. Id.\\n35\\nSSR 83-33 explains these tests in great detail and states that the first test\\nfocuses on whether the individual’s “countable earning s,” which represent the\\nvalue of the work performed, exceed the applicable earning s guideline. Under\\nthe first test for SGA, an individual’s “countable earning s” are calculated by\\nsubtracting  from gross earnings the amount of any subsidiz ed earning s from\\nthe employ er and the amoun t of certain impairment-related work expenses\\npaid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable earning s are then\\ncompared to the applicable amount listed in the earning s guidelines.\\nEarning s are considered subsidiz ed when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services.7 The Ruling\\nindicates that usually  the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s servic es according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow , inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employ ee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does not fully earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-sponsored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nId. Sometimes, an employ er can provide an adequate explanation of how a\\nsubsidy  was calculated. If not, the agency must question the employ er in\\nregard to the need for the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her\\npay to those services.\\nIf averag e mont hly countable income exceeds the applicable primary\\nguideline amount, the employ ee is ordinarily  considered engaged in SGA. If\\nthe earning s average less than the secondary  guideline amount, the employ ee\",\n",

[and]  whether the individual has good cause\\nfor not following  the prescribed treatment.”  The ruling  sets forth some examples of acceptable good\\ncause reasons for not following  the prescribed treatment, including  religion, cost, incapacity ,\\nmedical disag reement among  the claimant’s treating  sources, intense fear of surg ery, prior history\\nof unsuccessful results, high risk of loss of life or limb, and risk of addiction to opioid medication.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 05-02 PERTAINING TO \\nUNSUCCESSFUL WORK ATTEMPTS\\nOn May 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 05-02  pertaining  to unsuccessful work attempts as it was\\n“obsolete.” See 83 F ed. Reg . 22308 (May  14, 2018). As SSA ex plained:\\nOn February  28, 2005, we published  SSR 05-02, which provides guidance about\\ndetermining  whether substantial work activity  that is discontinued or reduced below\\na specified level may be considered an unsuccessful work attempt (UW A) under the\\ndisability  provisions of the law. SSR 05-02 explains the policies and procedures for\\nevaluating a work effort of 3 months or less and work efforts between 3 and 6\\nmonths.\\nOn October 17, 2016, we published final rules, Unsuccessful Work Attempts and\\nExpedited Reinstatement Eligibility , in the Federal Register at 81 FR 71367. These\\nrules, among  other thing s, removed some of the requirements for evaluation of an\\nUWA that lasts between 3 and 6 months. Specifically , the rules removed the\\nadditional conditions that we used when we evaluated a work attempt in employ ment\\nor self-employ ment that lasted between 3 and 6 months and provided that we now\\nuse one standard for work attempts lasting  6 months or less.\\nDue to these final rules and the resulting  simplification of our policies, SSR 05-02\\nis no longer correct. The final rules at 20 C.F.R. 404.1574(d), 404.1575( d),\\n416.974(c), 416.975(d) (unsuccessful work attempts) were effective November 16,\\n2016 . Consequently , we are rescinding  SSR 05-02 as obsolete. Notice of this\\nrescission is published in accordance with 20 C.F .R. 402.35(b)(1).\\nxxxviii\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 96-3P PERTAINING TO SEV ERITY  AND SSR 96-4P \\nPERTAINING TO MEDICALLY  DETERMINABLE IMPAIRMENTS\\nOn June 14, 2018, SSA rescinded SSR 96-3p  which addressed “Considering  Alleg ations of Pain and\\nOther Symptoms in Determining  Whether a Medically  Determinable Impairment is Sever e” and\\nSSR  96-4p which addressed “Symptoms, Medically  Deter minable Physical and Mental\\nImpairments, and Exertional and Nonex ertional Limitations. See 83 Fed. Reg. 27816 (June 14,\\n2018). SSA explained that these  two ruling s are “unnecessarily  duplicative of SSR 16-3p” which\\naddresses “Evaluation of Sy mptoms in Disability  Claims,” effective March 28, 2016. Id.\\nAs SSA explained, SSR 16-3p is a “more comprehensive statement of our policy  on symptoms,\\nexplains how we evaluate the extent to which alleg ed symptoms limit an adult’s ability  to perform\\nwork-related activities and a child’s ability  to function effectively  in an age-appropriate manner.”\\nId. SSR 96-3p  “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” as SSR 16-3p  “explains that we will consider\\nsymptoms and functional limitations to determine whether an impairment is severe unless the\\nobjective medical evidence alone establishes a severe [medically  determinab le impairment]  or\\ncombination of impairments that meets our duration requirement.” Id.\\nSSR 96-4p also “duplicates policy  in SSR 16-3p” because “[i]n SSR 16-3p, we clarified that an\\nindividual’s symptoms alone are not enough to establish the existence of a physical or mental\\nimpairment or disability , and that we will not find an individual disabled based on alleg ed symptoms\\nalone.” Id.\\nRESCISSION OF SSR 82-59 PERTAINING TO FAILURE \\nTO FOLLOW PRESCRIBED TREATMENT AND \\nSSR 83-20 PERTAINING TO ONSET OF DISABILITY\\nSSR 82-59 addressing  “Failure to follow prescribed treatment was rescinded on October 29, 2018;\\nSee 2018 WL 4945641 (Oct. 2, 2018). It was replaced with SSR 18-3p. SSR 83-20 addressing\\n“Onset of disability ” was rescinded on Octobe r 2, 2018; See 2018 WL 4945639 (Oct. 2, 2018). It\\nwas replaced with SSR 18-01p (Determining  the established onset date in disability  claims) and 18-\\n02p (Determining  the established onset date in blindness claims).\\n2017 CHANGES IN TH E LAW\\nREGULATORY RE VISIONS:  \\nIn a significant chang e, SSA substantially  revised its regulations pertaining  to medical evidence,\\neffective March 27, 2017.  See 82 Fed. Reg. 5844 (Jan. 18, 2017); 82 Fed. Reg 15132 (Mar.. 27,\\n2017); 83 F ed. Reg . 51836 (Oct. 15, 2018).  As noted in the summary  of the final rules:\\nThe revisions include redefining  several key terms related to evidence, revising  our\\nrules about acceptable medical sources (AMS), revising  how we consider and\\narticulate our consideration of medical opinions and prior administrative medical\\nxxxix\\nfinding s, revising  our rules about medical consultants  (MC) and psycholog ical\\nconsulta nts (PC), revising  our rules about treating  sources, and reorg anizing our\\nevidence reg ulations for ease of use.\\n82 Fed. Reg. at 5844. The new regulations are effective for claims filed on March 27, 2017 and\\nafter.  The regulations in effect on March 26, 2017 apply for claims filed before March 27, 2017. \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1527, 417.927 (2019).  \\nHighlights of the new reg ulations include:\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the medical opinions of a claimant’s\\ntreating  sources. I nstead, medical opinions and prior administrative medical finding s\\nwill be evaluated equally  for “persuasiveness” based most importantly  on\\n“consistency ” and “supportability .”\\n•Physicians Assistants (PAs) and Advance Practice Reg istered Nurses (APRNs) are\\nnow included in the list of Acceptable Medical Sources (AMSs). L icensed\\naudiolog ists and optometrists can also be AMSs for certain purposes within the\\nscopes of their practices.\\n•Adjudicators will g ive no special weig ht to the disability  decisions of other\\ngovernmental ag encies, including  the VA, but instead will consider and evaluate the\\nmedical evidence that was submitted to that ag ency  in support of that decision.\\n•SSA has rescinded SSR 96-2p, 96-5p, 96-6p and 06-03p and issued SSR 17-2p\\naddressing  finding s of medical equivalence. The rescissions apply  to all pending\\nclaims, including  claims filed before the rescissions . See  HAL LEX I -5-3-30.33\\nThese chang es are addressed in this publication.  Unfortunately , many  of these chang es are not\\nclaimant friendly , were driven by  data analy tics desig ned to produce fewer remands, and will\\nrequire more work on y our part to win cases.\\n33 HALLEX I-5-3-30 Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence. This new provision\\nhas important agency guidance concerning when to apply the new rules, protective filing date, evaluating\\nmedical evidence and subs equent applications.\\nxl\\nABOUT TH E AUTH OR\\nSarah H.

THE RECORD\\n_____ 1.The ALJ committed  reversible error by relying on an internet study  [or\\nmedical treatise or other non-record evidence]  to support his/her finding s.\\n_____ 2.The ALJ erred by disreg arding  the post-hearing evidence submitted by the\\nclaimant to the record and to consider this evidence in rendering  his/her\\ndecision. \\n_____ 3.The ALJ erred in not providing  a complete exhibit list with the decision as\\nrequired by HAL LEX I-2-1-20(B )(3) when the decision is less than fully\\nfavorable. \\nI. LATE F ILING  OF THE REQUEST F OR REVIEW\\n_____  1.

HEARING S BEF ORE THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n    _____ 1.The claimant’s request to appear before the Appeals Council for oral\\nargument should be granted because the case raises an important question of\\nlaw or policy , or oral arg ument would help to reach a proper decision. \\n_____ 2.The Appeals Council erred by failing to notify claimant and his/her\\nrepresentati ve that they may request an appearance before the AC to present\\noral argument, after the AC determined on its own motion to review the ALJ\\ndecision.\\n_____ 3.The Appeals Council failed to send notice to all parties that it had assumed\\nresponsibility  for claimant’s hearing  request as required by 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.956, 416.1456; thus, claimant’s failure to appear at a hearing  scheduled\\nby the Appeals Council should be excused and a new hearing  should be\\nscheduled on proper notice to the parties.\\n_____ 4.Since the Administrative Appeals Judge conducted a hearing  in claimant’s\\ncase and/or issued a hearing  decision, it was error for the same AAJ  to\\nparticipate in the Appeal s Council’s denial of claimant’s request for Appeals\\nCouncil review of that case under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.956, 416.1456, warranting\\nreconsideration by  the Appeals Council of the request for review.\\nK.   SUBMISSION OF  NEW EVIDENCE TO THE AP PEALS COUNCIL\\n____   1. The new evidence enclos ed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision and good cause exists for the failure to submit the\\nevidence to the AL J. \\n31\\n____   2. Even thoug h the evidence is dated after the date of the ALJ’s decision, it\\nrelates back to that period and is material, as the medical provider opined that\\nit related to the claimant’s condition for [list time period, i.e., the preceding\\nyear or since ***]  and there is good cause for the failure to submi t the\\nevidence to the AL J.\\n____  3.The new evidence enclosed from [list medical providers] warrants chang ing\\nthe ALJ’s decision as the evidence relates to the period prior to the ALJ’s\\ndecision, because there is a reasonable proba bility that the new evidence\\nwould chang e the outcome of the decision, and there is good cause for not\\nsubmitting  the evidence previously .\\n____ 4.The Appeals Council failed to proffer to claimant evidence receive d from  a\\nsource, other than the claimant or their representative, associ ated with the\\nclaim(s) file.\\n____  5. The Appeals Council failed to offer a supplemental hearing with proffered\\nevidence when the AC granted review and issued a less than fully  favorable\\ndecision.\\n____ 6.The Appeals Council failed to consider the claim ant’s request for review\\nagain after receiving additional evidence, because the AC did not associate the\\nnew evidence with the claim file before the AC released its denial notice.\\n____  7.The Appeals Council  must vacate its prior denial of review because it failed to\\nassociate claimant’s request for exhibits, hearing  recording (s), or extension of\\ntime received by  the AC prior to release of its denial notice.\\n____ 8.The Appeals Council must grant the claimant’s request for review because the\\nreview denial notice makes substantive finding s, or chang es the outcome of a\\nhearing  decision, or makes substitute finding s, or in any other way revises the\\nALJ’s decision.\\n_____ 9.The Appeals Council erred in deny ing claimant’s request for extension of\\ntime to submit evidence or arguments in support of a request for review, as\\ngood cause existed for the request under 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.911, 416.1411 in\\nthat [ one or more of the reasons stated in §§ 404.911, 416.1411]  existed.\\nL.  SUBSEQUENT AP PLICATIONS \\n____  1.The Appeals Council should allow the claimant to file a new claim as new \\nevidence exists which “shows a new critical or disabling  condition,” and,\\nunder SSR 11-1p, the claimant desires to file a new claim.\\n____ 2.Given the new evidence documenting a “critical or dire need situation,” the\\nAppeals Council should ex pedite its handling  of this claim. \\n32\\n____  3.Submission of new evidence to the Appeals Council, which is deemed\\nunrelated to the period at issue, establishes a protective filing  date for a\\nsubsequent application under SSR 11-1p.\\nM. RIGHT TO HEARING  BEFORE NEW ALJ\\n____ 1.in accordance with HAL LEX I-2-1-55(D)(6), this case should be assigned to a\\ndifferent ALJ on remand as it was already  the subject of a prior Appeals\\nCouncil remand order and has already been heard by the same ALJ on two\\nseparate occasions.\\n____ 2.As the ALJ’s conduct constitutes an abuse of discretion and documents that\\ns/he was biased against the claimant, the Appeals Council must remand the\\ncase to another ALJ for a new hearing  or revise the ALJ’s decision pursuant to\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.940 and 416.1440.\\nN.  DUTY TO F OLLOW AP PEALS COUNCIL REMAND ORDERS\\n____ 1.The ALJ abused his/her discretion when s/he refused to comply  with the\\nAppeals Council’s prior remand order.\\nO. ALJ BIAS, P REJUDICE, OR F AILURE TO F OLLOW P ROCEDURES\\n ____ 1.In accordance with SSR 13-1p, the Appeals Council  should issue a new\\ndecision or remand in light of the [ALJ’s non-compliance with required\\nprocedures]  [evidence of prejudice or partiality  on the part of the AL J].\\n____ 2.The ALJ was biased against the claimant as evidence by his/her critical\\nstatements about the claimant’s sex , race, national orig in, relig ion, etc.\\n____ 3.The langu age of the ALJ’s decision did not comply  with HALLEX I-2-8-\\n25(A) as the ALJ used the decision as a forum to criticiz e [agency , agency\\npolicy  or procedure, other governmental agencies, the court,  the\\nrepresentative, or the claimant] . \\n____ 4.The ALJ who heard the case following  court remand admitted on the record\\nthat s/he would not follow the court order as s/he disag reed with the court\\nfinding s, thereby  violating  HAL LEX I -2-8-25.\\nP.  REDETERMINATIONS DUE TO FRAUD OR SIMILAR F AULT \\n____  1.The ALJ failed to address the claimant’s objections to the disreg arding of\\nevidence from the record as required by  SSR 22-1p and SSR 22-2p.\\n____   2.The ALJ’s finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar fault\\nwas involved in providing  evidence is not supported by  substantial evidence. \\n33\\n ____  3.The ALJ failed to apply  the applicable standard for excluding evidence in\\nbelieving  that fraud or similar fault was involved in providing  evidence as\\nthere was no “reason to believe, meaning  reasonable grounds to suspect, that\\nthe person knew the evidence provid ed was false or incomplete or that the\\ninformation that was material to the determination was knowing ly concealed.”\\n____  4.The ALJ erred in finding  that there was reason to believe that fraud or similar\\nfault was involved as this finding  was based on mere suspicion, speculation, \\nor a hunch.\\n____  5.The ALJ failed to take the claimant’s mental illness [or other reason] into\\naccount in exclud ing evidence as s/he was not aware that the evidence\\nprovided was not correct or incomplete or that material information was not\\nprovided.  \\n____ 6.The ALJ failed to comply with his/her duty to assist the claimant, as\\nrequested, in obtaining  evidence relevant to the redetermination of the claim\\nas required by  SSR 22-1p.  \\n____ 7.The ALJ failed to comply  with SSR 22-1p in not properly  considering  the\\nclaimant’s eligibility  for benefits in light of the remaining  evidence, including\\nevidence not presented previously  and evidence post-dating  the original\\nallowance, which related to the period at issue.\\n____ 8.The notice of determination or decision that evidence will be disreg arded due\\nto fraud or similar fault is deficient because [state reason]  and these\\ndeficiencie s prevent the claimant from determining  whether to submit\\nobjections or appeal the determination/decision.  \\n34\\nSAMPLE ARGUMENTS\\nI. SEQUENTIAL EVALUATION PRO CESS ISSUE S4\\n  A. STEP  1 - SUB STANTIAL GAINFUL  ACT IVITY (SG A) \\n1.The ALJ did not compl y with SSR 83-33 in finding  that the claimant’s\\nemploy ment constitutes SGA.\\nApplic able law: SSR 83-33 indicates that earning s representing  the value of\\nthe work performed must be identified before consulting  the earning s\\nguidelines.5 Work will be considered SGA if it meets any of three tests. Only\\nthe first test is used, however, where income  is less than the specified\\nsecondary  guidelines amount unless there is some indication that an\\nindividual whose earning s presumably  indicate no SGA is nevertheless\\nperforming  SGA. Id. In accordance with SSR 94-1c, illegal activity  may\\nconstitute SGA.6\\nSSR 83-33 provides that work will be considered SGA if it meets one of three\\ntests. The first  test for employ ment focuses on countable earning s. The second\\nand third tests look to the comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired\\npeople in similar businesses/occu pations and to the worth of the work activity .\\nId. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in accordance with SSR 83-33 and\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574, 416.974.\\n4 Unde r the sequential evaluation process, the first step is to determine whether the claimant is engaging in\\nsubstantial gainful activity.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( b). If so, the claim is denied. If not, the second st ep is to\\ndetermine whether the claimant has a severe impairment, i.e., an impairment which significantly limits ability\\nto do basic work activities.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( c).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If a severe impairment\\nis present, the third step is to determine whether it meets or equals a listed impairment.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( d).  If it does, a finding of disability is directed.  Id.  If not, the fourth step is to determine whether\\nthe claimant has an impairment which precludes the performance of past relevant work.  20 C.F.R. §\\n404.1520( e).  If not, the claim is denied. Id. If so, the fifth step is to determine whether the claimant’s\\nimpairments prevent the performance of any other work, considering residual functional capacity, age,\\neducation, and work experience.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520( f).  These regulations pertain to Social Security\\ndisability insurance cases. Identical regulations pertain to SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.920( b).\\n5 The tiered earnings format was discontinued beginning in 2001. Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted each\\nyear, can be f ound a t: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed  Ma y 1, 2024) .\\n6 SSR 94-1c adopts the Seventh Circuit’s opinion rendered in Dotson v. Shal ala, 1 F.3d 571 (7th Cir. 1993) ,\\nand introduces the opinion with a summary of this decision. This summary explains that the court held: (1)\\nillegal activity can constitute SGA, after noting nothing in the Act or regulations requires SGA t o be lawful\\nor recognizes a distinction between lawful and unlawful activity for purpo ses of determining SGA ; (2)  the\\nclaimant’s uncontradicted testimony regarding the thievery he performed to suppo rt his $200- $300 per day\\ndrug habit provided substantial evidence to suppor t the ALJ’s finding that the claimant was engaged in SGA;\\n(3) the cost of the narcotics need not be deducted from his income as an IRWE;  and (4) the claimant raised\\nno meritorious due pr ocess or equal protection arguments. Id.\\n35\\nSSR 83-33 explains these tests in great detail and states that the first test\\nfocuses on whether the individual’s “countable earning s,” which represent the\\nvalue of the work performed, exceed the applicable earning s guideline. Under\\nthe first test for SGA, an individual’s “countable earning s” are calculated by\\nsubtracting  from gross earnings the amount of any subsidiz ed earning s from\\nthe employ er and the amoun t of certain impairment-related work expenses\\npaid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable earning s are then\\ncompared to the applicable amount listed in the earning s guidelines.\\nEarning s are considered subsidiz ed when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services.7 The Ruling\\nindicates that usually  the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s servic es according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow , inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employ ee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does not fully earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-sponsored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nId. Sometimes, an employ er can provide an adequate explanation of how a\\nsubsidy  was calculated. If not, the agency must question the employ er in\\nregard to the need for the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her\\npay to those services.\\nIf averag e mont hly countable income exceeds the applicable primary\\nguideline amount, the employ ee is ordinarily  considered engaged in SGA. If\\nthe earning s average less than the secondary  guideline amount, the employ ee\"\n",

The document \\\"Winning Appeals Council Arguments, 11th Edition\\\" by Sarah H. Bohr highlights specific SSRs that are particularly relevant for individuals with visual impairments. For instance, SSR 24-1p provides guidance on how past relevant work (PRW) is evaluated, which can be crucial for blind claimants. Additionally, SSR 18-02p specifically addresses the established onset date in blindness claims, ensuring that individuals who are blind receive appropriate consideration in their disability claims.\\n\\nFurthermore, the document outlines the criteria for assessing disabilities, including the evaluation of medically determinable impairments. It emphasizes that if a claimant has a medically determinable impairment, the SSA must consider whether the prescribed treatment, if followed, would restore the individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA). The ruling also provides examples of acceptable reasons for not following prescribed treatment, which can be particularly relevant for individuals with disabilities, including blindness.\\n\\nOverall, the document serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the legal framework and specific rulings that can aid blind individuals in their disability claims and appeals.\"\n",

If such evidence is present, development is necessary to determine whether\\none of the other two tests for SGA is met. Where earning s fall between or are\\nequal to the specified primary  and secondary  amounts, an adjudicator will\\ngenerally  turn to the other tests for SGA.\\nThe seco nd test asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to\\nthat of unimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar\\noccupations. Under the second test, the individual’s work activity  is analy zed\\nin relation to the time, energ y, skills, and responsibility  involved in its\\nperformance. The issue is whethe r the work performed “is essentially  the\\nsame in quality and quantity  as that done by unimpaired individuals engaged\\nin the same or similar occupations as their means of livelihood.” Where the\\ncorrect answer is unclear, the agency  must “contact the employ er, the U.S.\\nEmploy ment Service, or other informe d sources in the community  for\\ninformation as to the time, energy, duties, and responsibilities of unimpaired\\nworkers doing  the same or similar work.” Id.\\nThe third test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the individual’s\\nwork activity , with reference to the prevailing pay scales of the community , is\\nclearly  worth more than the other wise applicable primary  amount listed in the\\nearning s guidelines.8 Id.\\nSSR 83-33 discusses the need for detailed documentation under the second\\nand third tests. The Ruling  further provides that a reasonable explanation as to\\nwhy work is not substantial will preclude a finding  of SGA pursuant to these\\ntests. Reasonable doubts are normally  to be resolved in favor of the claimant.\\nFinally , the Ruling  explains that unsuccessful work attempts are not SGA.\\nFor both the second and third tests of SGA, the Ruling  states that\\ndocumentation should go beyond the employee’s description of his or her\\nwork and include “a detailed description of how the work is performed by\\nunimpaired persons in the community , including  their remuneration, hours,\\nduties, and responsibilities.” Id. Such information should be soug ht from a\\nlocal employ ment service or other authoritative source. Also, under the\\nsecond and third tests, a reasonable explanation as to why earning s are not\\nsubstantial prevents a finding  of SGA.\\nAccording  to SSR 83-33, a finding  of SGA is inappropriate if there is a\\nreasonable explanation of why an employ ee’s earning s are not substantia l. An\\nexample of a reasonable explanation would be the employ ee’s inability  to\\nperform the full responsibilities of the job due to reduced pace or hours. “It\\n8 The tiered earnings scheme, with primary and secondary guidelines amounts, was discontinued beg inning\\nin 2001.

Id.\\n2.The ALJ erroneous ly concluded that the claimant’s self-employ ment\\nconstitutes SGA as set forth in SSR 83-34.\\nApplicabl e law: SSR 83-34 provides that work will be considered SGA if it\\nmeets one of three tests. The first test for self-employ ment concerns whether\\nthe individual renders significant services to and receives a substantial income\\nfrom the business. The second and third tests look to the comparab ility of the\\nwork to that of unimpaired people in similar businesses/occupations and to the\\nworth of the work activity . Id. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in\\naccordance with the Ruling  and 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1575, 416.975.9\\nSSR 83-34 provides that work activity  must be in accordance with three tests\\nbefore it can be determined not to constitute SGA. However, if one test\\nindicates the work qualifies as SGA, the inquiry  ceases and the work activity\\nis deemed SGA without reg ard to the other tests.\\nThe first test focuses on whether the individual renders significant services to\\nand receives a substantial income from the business. To find SGA under the\\nfirst test, both conditions must be met: the provision of significant services to\\nand receipt of a substantial income from the business. According  to the\\nRuling , the services of someone engaged in a one-person business are\\nnecessarily  significant. The only question remaining  for such individuals\\nconcerns whether the income received is substantial. For businesses involving\\nthe services of two or more people, an “owner or partner will be found to be\\nrendering  significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total\\ntime required for management of the business, or renders manag ement\\nservices for more than 45 hours a mont h regardless of the total manag ement\\ntime required by the busine ss.” Id. A farm landlord performs significant\\nservices if he or she materially participates in crop or livestock production or\\nmanag ement. Material participation is explained in the regulations at 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1082.\\nAn individual receives “substantial income” if: (1) the amount of “countable\\nincome” derived from the business on averag e for the calendar year exceeds\\nthe applicable earning s guideline; (2) the livelihood derived from the business\\nis comparable to that during  his or her pre-disability  period; or (3) the\\nlivelihood derived is comparable to that of unimpaired people making  a living\\n9 See also SSR 12- 1p (evaluation of SGA f or blind se lf-employed claimants).\\n38\\nin the same or similar businesses. Countable income is determined by\\ncalculating  the income representing  the person’s own productivity , which is\\ndone throug h figuring net income and then deducting  the reasona ble value of\\nany significant amount of unpaid help furnished by others, impairment-related\\nwork expenses, unincurred business expenses paid for by others, and certain\\nsoil bank payments. The Ruling  discusses the determination of the value of\\nthese deductions. Id.\\nIf averag e monthly  countable income does not exceed the applicable guideline\\namount,10 the individual may still receive “substantial income” from the\\nbusiness under the second standard if he or she continues to receive a\\nlivelihood comparable to that received for a number of years before disability .\\nThis standard is applicable where the business formed “the sole means of\\nlivelihood” during  the earlier years. The Ruling  cautions, moreover, that\\n“chronic illness or other special circumstances existing  from some time prior\\nto the individual’s becoming  disabled may indicate that his or her financial\\nsituation in that period should not be considered an indication of the\\nindividual’s standard of livelihood .” If that is the case, the third test for\\nsubstantial income would be “more pertinent.”\\nThe last test for substantial income indicates SGA will be found where the\\ncommunity  standard of livelihood for similar businesses is met, without\\nregard to the individual’s pre-disability  circumstances. SSR 83- 34 recog nizes\\nthat in determining  the community  standard, unrepresentative individuals\\nmust be excluded—for example, individuals whose “chronic illness accounts\\nfor a low level of income.”\\nThe second and third tests are discussed together by the Ruling . These look to\\nthe comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired people in similar\\nbusinesses and to the worth of the work activity , respectively . The second test\\nfor SGA asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to that of\\nunimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar businesses.\\nUnder the second test for SGA, the individual’s  work activity  is assessed “in\\nterms of all relevant factors such as hours, skills, energ y output, efficiency,\\nduties, and responsibilities[ .]” SSR 83-34 provides that each factor must be\\ndescribed in detail by the adjudicator, showing  its contribution to the business.\\nIf this activity  is established by conclusive evidence to be comparable to that\\nof unimpaired people who: (1) reside in the same community ; (2) are engaged\\nin the same or similar businesses, with the type of self-employ ment being  the\\nsame; and (3) are so engaged as their means of livelihood, the individual may\\nbe considered to be performing  SGA. Inconclusive evidence, including\\ngeneral rather than specific descriptions of the relevant factors, “will result in\\na finding  that work performed is not SGA.” Doubts must be resolved in favor\\nof the claimant. Further, the comparison group must derive a standard of\\n10 Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted yearly at: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed May 1,\\n2024) .\\n39\\nliving  considered adequate for the community .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that it might be necessa ry to develop the record\\nwith more information about the claimant’s activ ities than he or she can\\nprovide. “Contact, therefore, should be made with people having firsthand\\nknowledg e of the impaired individual’s work situation obtained  through\\nactual participation or observation.”\\nThe third and final test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the\\nindividual’s work activity  is clearly  worth more than the otherwise applicable\\namount listed in the earning s guidelines. The work activity  must be\\nconsidered either in relation to its value to the business or to the salar y an\\nowner would pay  an employ ee for the work.\\n3.The ALJ did not properly  averag e the claimant’s earnings  as set forth in SSR\\n83-35 in finding  that s/he eng aged in SGA.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-35 describes when and how averag ing countable\\nearning s or incom e is done for SGA determination purposes. It explains\\naverag ing in initial disability  cases and in continuing  disability  cases, except\\nduring  the reentitlement period.\\nIn determining  whether an employ ee’s averag e monthly  earning s\\npresumptively  indicate SGA by exceedin g the Earning s Guidelines,11 some\\nmethod is necessary  in cases where earnings  vary significantly  over time or\\nthe guidelines earnings level chang es. SSR 83-35 explains that in such cases\\n“it will be necessary  to average separately  the distinct periods of work\\ninvolved when there is a regulatory change in the SGA earning s level or there\\nis a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or earning s.”\\nSSR 83-35 diffe rentiates between earning s varying “somewhat” over the\\nmonths at issue and earning s that reflect a “significant chang e.” It explains\\nthat earning s or work activities varying “somewhat” require averagi ng “over a\\nnumber of months” before comparison with the Earning s Guidelines.12\\nSSR 83-55 states that certain situations require averag ing of earning s over\\ndistinct periods. It will be necessary  to averag e separately  the distinc t periods\\nof work involved when there is either (1) a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearnings level; or (2) a significant chang e in work patterns or income. The\\nfirst circumstance is straig htforward and can be determined by reference to\\nthe guidelines table, with earning s averaged over each period for which a\\ndifferent SGA level applies. Concerning  the second circumstance, the Ruling\\nstates:\\n11 Presumptive SGA a mounts, upda ted yearly, found a t: \\nhttp://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/ COL A/sga.html (Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .  \\n12 The  Ruling does not define “somewhat.”\\n40\\nWhen there is significant chang e in work patterns or earning s during  the\\nperiod of work requiring  evaluation, earning s are not averag ed over the\\nentire period of work involved. When there is such a change, it would not\\nbe appropriate to averag e earning s over the entire period of work, since\\none period of work activity  may not be representative of the other period.\\nUnrepresentative periods of work involve separate and distinct work\\nefforts. When there is a significant chang e in work patterns or earning s,\\nthe earnin gs must be averag ed over each separate period of work involved\\nto determine if either effort was SGA.\\nThe implication of this Ruling  is that when there is no “separate and distinct\\nwork effort,” but rather the same job, earning s must be averaged over the\\nwhole relevant period.\\nSSR 83-55 explain s how averaging is applied to the income of self- employ ed\\nindividuals.  While similar in many  respects to the assessment of the earning s\\nof employ ed people, a determination of averag e monthly  income for self-\\nemploy ed individuals must “consider whether the period of time included in\\ndetermining  averag e monthly  ‘countable income’ is, in fact, representativ e of\\nthe individual’s financial situation during  the period involved in the SGA\\nissue.”  The Ruling explains that ordinarily  income is to be averag ed over the\\nentire period of work at issue, as with employ ees, except where there is an\\nSGA earning s level chang e or “a significant chang e in work patterns or\\nincome.” It is necessary  to averag e a self-employ ed “individual’s ‘countable\\nincome’ by figuring total ‘countable income’ over a representative period and\\ndividing  by the number of months in that period”- separately  averag ing\\ndistinct periods of work “when there is a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearning s level or there is a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or income.”\\nSSR 83-35 also provides that engagement in SGA may be attributed to the\\nentire period. The Ruling  notes that where averag ed earning s or income\\nindicates SGA, “an individual may for purposes of the disability\\ndetermination be considered to have engaged continuously  in SGA  during the\\nentire period being  averag ed.”\\nFinally , SSR 83-35 addresses situations where a claimant has either stopped\\nworking  or has only recently  begun a pattern of work. In cases where a\\nclaimant is no longer working, but previously  worked for a continuous period,\\nearnings are to be averag ed over the actual period of work involved. On the\\nother hand, where the person has been empl oyed only a short time, such as 3\\nor 4 weeks, an evaluat ion must be made based on “the individual’s expected\\nwork pattern and earning s. If work was going on at the time of last contact\\nwith the individual, evaluation should be made in anticipation of its\\ncontinuance without other interruptions, in the absence of evidence clearly\\nindicating  the contrary .” A revision may be warranted, howev er, if subsequent\\nevidence shows the anticipated level of earning s did not materializ e.  Id.\\nFor details, see POMS DI  10505.015, Averag ing Countable Earning s.\\n41\\n4.The ALJ erroneously  concluded that the claimant’s employ ment constitutes\\nSGA without properly  considering  work-related subsidies as set forth in SSR\\n83-33.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-33 provides that an individual’s “countable\\nearning s” are calculated by subtracting  from gross earning s the amount of any\\nsubsidiz ed earning s from the employ er and the amount of certain impairme nt-\\nrelated work expenses paid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable\\nearning s are then compared to the applicable presumptive amount.\\nEarning s are considered subsidized when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services. SSR. The Ruling\\nindicates that usually the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s services according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work. Id.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple  tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow, inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” Id. The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Id. Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does  not fully  earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-spon sored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nWhere an employ er cannot provide an adequate explanation of how a subsidy\\nwas calculated, the agency  must question the employer in regard to the need\\nfor the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her pay to those\\nservices.  Id.  For more details, see POMS DI 10505.010(A) Determining\\nCountable Earning s, Subsidies.\\n5.The AL J erred by  counting  earning s from an unsuccessful work attempt.\\nApplicable law: In accordance with the unsuccessful work attempt (UW A)\\nrule discussed in SSR 83-34 and SSR 83-35, work activity  does not\\n42\\ndemonstra te an ability  to engage in SGA if, after working  no more than six\\nmonths, the individual involuntarily  discontinues or reduces such work  below\\nthe SGA level for reasons relating  to his or her impairment. The rule applies\\nto both employ ees and self-employ ed individuals. Id. See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1574(c)(1), 416.974(c)(1).  The regulations define an UWA as work that\\na claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her\\nimpairments.  Id.  SSR 84-25 prov ides that the UWA must be preceded by a\\nperiod when the claimant is either not working or performing  work below the\\nSGA level. A claimant can have a series of UWAs: “each continuous\\nperilosingrated by significant breaks as described, may be an UWA as long as\\ncriteria as to duration and conditions of work are met. . . .”  \\nIf the work lasted less than six months, it is an UWA if the claimant stopped\\nor reduced work earning s below SGA level as a result of the impairment or\\nthe removal of “special conditions that took into account your impairment and\\npermitted you to work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1574(c)(3), 416.974(c)(3).  Work\\nthat lasted more than six months at the SGA level is not “an unsuccessful\\nwork attempt regardless of why it ended or was reduced below [SGA]  level.” \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574(c)(4), 416.974(c)(4).\\n6.Work performed for fewer than 30 calend ar days is not considered past\\nrelevant work, even if it was performed at the SGA level.  \\nUnder revised regulations, SSA will also no longer consider past work that\\nstarted and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days to be past relevant work. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.965(b)(1)(ii).  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) specifically  provides:\\n(ii) 30 calendar days . When we consider past relevant work and work\\nexperience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30\\nconsecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.\\nWhen we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do\\nnot consider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period,\\nor whether the work was full-time or part-time. The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\nactiv ity or whether you worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthoug h the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntowa rd the time needed for you to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contra ctor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSee also SSR 24-2p (also providing  that work is not PRW  if it the work\\nstarted and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar day s).  \\nSSR 24-2p explains that if a claimant was self-emp loyed or an independent\\ncontractor, SSA will consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type\\n43\\nof work for 30 calendar days even if individual work assignments or contracts\\neach lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are\\nprovided in SSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW\\nincludes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30\\ncalendar days or more because the individual did the same job for at least 30\\ncalendar days even thoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped\\nwithin a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. SSR 24-2p provides two\\nexamples interpreting  the 30 calendar day  requirement:\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW if it was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample 2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during the 5-year relevant work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ did not address  impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) as\\nrequired as set forth in SSRs 83-33 and 84-26.\\nApplicable law: SSR 84-26 explains in detail SSA policy  regarding  IRWE\\nfor people who meet the SSA definition of disability . Under certain\\ncircumstances, an individual’s expenses are deducted from his or her income\\nwhen determining  whether that income reflects SGA.\\nThe cost of certain items and services can be deducted from an impaired\\nperson’s earning s when determining  SGA . Generally , these must be items and\\nservices the person needs in order to work, althoug h they may simul taneously\\nbe required for normal daily  activiti es. SSR  84-26 specifies that where an\\nIRWE otherwise qualifies, it is irrelevant that the equipment or service “is\\nalso needed to enable the indivi dual to carry  out normal daily  functions[ .]”\\nThe entire amount of the expense is deductible, without any reduction.\\nAllowable amounts are subject to reasonable limits, and to qualify  the\\npayments for the items and services must have been made by the impaired\\nindividual.\\nSSR 84-26 discusses in detail qualify ing expenses in six major categ ories and\\nprovides multiple examples in relation thereto and explains what showing  of\\nnecessity , if any, is required for each categ ory. These six major categ ories are\\n44\\n(1) attendant care services; (2) medical devices; (3) prostheses; (4) other\\nequipment; (5) routine drugs and routine medical services; and (6) similar\\nitems and services. Multiple examples are set forth of services and equipment\\nthat are deductible in appropriate circumstances . No separate showing  of\\nnecessity  is requir ed with regard to prostheses, whereas medical devices\\nqualify  when they are primarily  used for a medical purpose and are not\\ngenerally  useful to healthy  individua ls. However, the needs met by attendant\\ncare services must be “essential” and the services shown necessary  to enable\\nthe person to work. Similarly , to qualify  as “other equipment” an item must be\\nneeded for performing  required job tasks, “or to move from home to mode of\\ntransportation, or to control the disabli ng condition at home or in the work\\nsetting  so as to be able to function in a work activity .” Routine drugs and\\nmedical services, as well as similar items and services, must also be necessary\\nfor enabling  the individual to work.\\nSSR 84-26 clarifies that the impaired individual must be the one who pays the\\ncost of the equipment or services. In other words, the expense “has not been,\\ncannot be, and will not be, reimbursed by any source for the expense.”\\nFurther, payment must be made in “cash,” which includes checks or other\\nforms of money  but not pay ment in-kind. Proof of pay ment must be provided.\\nSSR 84-26 also caution s that the deductible amount of IRWE “is subject to\\nreasonable limits”:\\nGenerally , the amount paid for medical services, medical device...,\\nprostheses, and similar medically -related items and services will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it is no more than the Medicare prevailing  charg e\\nestabl ished for the same item or service in the individual’s locale under\\nPart B of title XVIII of the Social Security  Act (Health Insurance for the\\nAged and Disabled).\\nPrevailing  charg e information is available from individual Medicare carriers\\nthroug h Social Security  district offices. If the amount paid for an item or\\nservice exceeds the Medicar e prevailing  charg e in the individual’s locale, an\\namount equal to the prevailing  charg e will be deducted from earni ngs.  If the\\nimpaired individual wishes  to establish the reasonableness of the amount paid,\\nhe or she may rebut the prevailing  charg e guidelines by demonst rating  that the\\namount paid is consistent with the standard or normal charg e for the same or\\nsimilar item or service in his or her community .  If the reported item or\\nservice is not listed in the Medicare guidelines, the amount paid will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it does not exceed the standard or normal charge for\\nthe same or similar item or service in the impaired individual’s community .\\nAdditionally , when IRWE deductions are taken, SGA is ordinar ily determined\\nby focusing on earnings rather than the value of services rendered.  The\\nRuling  notes that in cases involving  IRWE deductions, the SGA decision will\\ngeneral ly be based strictly  on the individual’s earning s rather than the value of\\nservices the individual rendered. There is an exception, howev er: “the\\n45\\nsituation in which a person is in a position to control or manipulate the\\namount of his or her earning s, e.g., the person is self-employ ed and the value\\nof services rendered is clearly  worth an amount  greater than the earning s\\nreceived.”\\nFinally , SSR 84-26 explains that the provision regarding  IRWE deductions\\ndoes not apply  to determinations of whether a month of “services” is\\ncharg eable for trial work period purp oses. “In other words, deductions will\\nnot be made to determine whether a person’s monthly  earning s can be reduced\\nto $75 or less.”  Id. \\nFor more details, see POMS DI 10520.001 Impairment-Related Work\\nExpenses (I RWE).\\n8.The ALJ erred by excluding the blind claimant’s income related to vending\\nmachine operation when determining  whether SGA was being  performed.\\nApplicable law: SSR 12-1p discusses the treatment of income that blind self-\\nemploy ed vendors receive under the Randolph-Sheppard Act (and similar\\nState programs) from vending  machines that are located on the same property ,\\nbut are not serviced, operated, or maintained by the blind vendor.13  This\\nincome is subtracted from the person’s income before the total is compared to\\nthe applicable guideline as it is not a measure of his or her own productivity . \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1584, 416.984.\\nB.

Similarly ,\\nwhere the Appeals Council issues a decis ion, it “may  ask its medical support\\n50\\nstaff  to help decide whether an individual’s impairment(s) medically  equals a\\nlisting .”\\nSSR 17-2p prohibits an adjudicator from finding  that a claimant’s\\nimpairments are medically  equivalen t to a listed impairment unless a medical\\nconsultant, psycholog ical consultant, medical expert, or Appeal s Council\\nmedical support staff opines that the claimant’s impairments(s) medic ally\\nequal the listing .  However, under the Ruling , an ALJ or the Appeals Council\\nare not required to obtain an opinion from a medical expert about medical\\nequivalence if the ALJ or the Appeals Council believes that the evidence does\\nnot reasonably  support a medical equivalence finding.  Further, an ALJ may\\nnot rely on a medical expert’s conclusory  opinion that a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s ) medically  equal the listing , but “must ask the ME to identify\\nmedical evidence in the record that supports the ME’s” opinion that a listing\\nis medically  equaled.\\nIn addition, if an ALJ determin es that a claimant’s impairments medically\\nequal the listing , the ALJ “must articulate how the record establishes medical\\nequival ency using  one of the three methods specified in 20 C.F.R. 404.1526\\nand 416.926.”  If an ALJ finds that a claimant’s impairments do not medically\\nequal a listing , that finding  alone is generally  sufficient articul ation for the\\nfinding .\\nD.

It is crucial to the\\ndetermination of disability  as it is used to determine whether a claimant can\\nperform his/her past relevant work and/or any other type of work in the\\nnational economy .  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e) and (f), 416.920(e) and (f). \\nIndeed, RF C is defined as follows:\\nResidual Functional Capacity .  A medical assessmen t of what an\\nindividua l can do in a work setting  in spite of the functional limitations\\nand environmental restrictions imposed by all of his or her medi cally\\ndeterminable impairment(s).

SSR 85-15 provides that:\\n[t]he basic mental demands of com petitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supervision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations ; and to deal with chang es in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial  loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experience will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nSSR 85-16 cautions that a conclusion an individ ual can perform SGA is “not\\nto be inferred merely  from the fact that the mental disorder is not of listing\\nseverity.”  Id.  Further, the Ruling  provides that determining  mental RFC\\ninvolves the consider ation of evidence including : (1) all relevant history ,\\nfinding s and observations from medical sources; (2) reports of daily  living\\nand work activities; (3) third-party  testimony  regarding  performance and\\nbehavior; and (4) reports from workshops, group homes, or similar entities. \\nId.\\nThe Commissioner’s Ruling s demonstrate the need for presen tation of a\\nspecific, valid rationale supporting  any finding  that an individual’s\\nnonex ertional limitations do not signific antly limit basic work skills.  In\\n54\\naccordance with SSR 83-14, in cases involving  a combination of exertional\\nand nonex ertional impa irments, “[t]he usual requirements apply  for a clear,\\npersuasive, orderly  rationale.

The four factors set forth in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a are part of the Psychiatric Review Technique\\nevaluation and are not suffici ently detailed to constitute ultimate RFC\\nfinding s.  As set forth in SSR 96-8p:\\nThe psychiatric  review technique described in 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and\\n416.920a and summariz ed on the Psychiatric Review Technique Form\\n(PRTF ) requires adjudicators to assess an individual’s limitations and\\nrestrictions from a mental impairment(s) in categ ories identified in the\\n“parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria of the adult mental disorders\\nlisting s.  The adjudicator must remember that the limitations identified in\\nthe “parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria are not an RFC assessment\\nbut are used to rate the severity  of mental impai rment(s) at steps 2 and 3\\nof the sequential evaluation process.  The mental RFC assessment used at\\nsteps 4 and 5 of the sequential evaluation process requir es a more detailed\\nassessment by itemiz ing various functions contained in the broad\\ncateg ories found in parag raphs B and C of the adult mental disorder\\nlisting s in 12.00 of the Listing  of Impairments and summariz ed on the\\nPRTF.\\n5.The ALJ’s mental RFC assessment is deficient as a matter of law because\\nthe ALJ did not [account for/build upon]  the finding s made as part of the\\npsychiatric review technique evauation.\\n6. The ALJ failed to account for his/her PRTF findings in the RFC\\nassessment, such as a moderate limitation in interacting with others as the\\nALJ did not address interacti on with supervisors, co-workers and/or the\\npublic.\\nApplicable law:  As “[t]he mental RFC assessment used at steps  4 and 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process requires a more detailed assessment”\\nthan the Psychiatric Review Technique evaluation, SSR 96-8p, the ALJ\\n55\\ncannot overlook or fail to expand upon the finding s made as part of that\\nevaluation.  The regulations explain that “[a]n assessment of . . .

Althoug h a sedentary\\njob is defined as one that involves sitting , a certain amount of walking  and\\nstanding  is often necessary  in carry ing out job duties.  Jobs are sedentary\\nif walking  and standing  are required occasionally  and other sedentary\\ncriteria are met.  “Occasionally ” means occurring  from very little up to\\none-third of the time and would generally  total no more than about 2 hours\\nof an 8-hour workday .  Sitting would generally  total about 6 hours of an 8-\\nhour workday . Unskilled sedentary  work also involves other activities,\\nclassified as “nonex ertion al,” such as capacities for seeing , manipulation,\\nand understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  dismissed the claimant’s need for an assistive device\\nbecause of the lack of a prescription. \\nApplicable law.

An assistive device, for the purposes of these listing s, is any\\ndevice that you use to improve your stability , dexterity , or mobility . An\\nassistive device can be worn (see 1.00C6b and 1.00C6c), hand- held (see\\n1.00C6d), or used in a seated position (see 1.00C6e). When we use the\\nphrase “documented medical need,” we mean that there is evidence from a\\nmedical source that supports your medical need for an assistive device\\n(see 1.00C2b) for a continuous period of at least 12 months (see 1.00C6a).\\nThis evidence must describe any limitation(s) in your upper or lower\\nextremity  functioning  and the circumstan ces for which you need to use the\\nassistive  device.

Id.  SSR 96-9p further notes\\nthat “the occupational base for an individual who must use [an assistive]\\ndevice for balance  because of significant involvement of both lower\\nextremities (e.g., because of a neurolog ical impairment) may be significant ly\\neroded .”  Id. See also POMS DI 25015.020(B )(6) (addressing  “Medically\\nrequired hand-held assistive device”).\\n5.Given the evidence that the claimant cannot bend [or stoop] , the ALJ’s\\nfinding  that s/he can perform the full range of sedentary  [or light] work is not\\nbased on substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law : As set forth in Social Security  Ruling  96-9p:\\n[a]n ability  to stoop occasionally ; i.e., from very little up to one-third of\\nthe time, is required in most unskilled sedentary  occupations.  A complete\\ninability  to stoop would significantly  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and a finding  that the individual is disabled would\\nusually  apply  . . . .\\nLight work also requires stooping  occasionally , or at least one-third of the\\nworkday .  See SSR 83-10.  Stooping  is defined as “bending  the body\\ndownward and forward by  bending  the spine at the waist.”  SSR 85-15.\\n6.Given the evidence that the claimant can only bend [or stoop]  occasionally ,\\nthe ALJ’s finding  that s/he can perform the full range of medium work is not\\nbased on substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in Social Security  Ruling  83-10, medium work\\nordinarily  “requires frequent bending -stooping .”  Stooping  is defined as\\n“bending  the body  downward and forward by bending  the spine at the waist.” \\nSSR 85-15.\\n7.Given the claimant’s reaching  and handling  limitatio ns, s/he cannot perform\\nthe full rang e of sedentary  [or lig ht] work as found by  the AL J.\\nApplicable law :  As set forth in SSR 85-15:\\n57\\n[r]eaching  (extending  the hands and arms in any direction) and handling\\n(seiz ing, holding , grasping , turning  or otherwise working  primarily  with\\nthe whole hand or hands) are activities required in almost all jobs. \\nSignificant limitations of reaching  or handling , therefore, may eliminate a\\nlarge number of occupations a person could otherwise do.\\n8.Given the claimant’s need for frequent breaks, s/he cannot perform the full\\nrang e of sedentary  work as found by  the AL J.\\nApplicable law:  As set forth in SSR 96-9p, the only  “breaks” provided in an\\n8-hour day are a “morning  break, a lunch period, and an afternoon break at\\napprox imately  2-hour intervals.”\\n9.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can perform a full rang e of light work is\\nnot supported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law :  SSR 83-10 defines lig ht work as follows:\\nlifting  no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting  or carry ing\\nof objects weighing  up to 10 pounds.  Even thoug h the weig ht lifted in a\\nparticular light job may be very  little, a job is in this categ ory when it\\nrequires a good deal of walking  or standing  – the primary  difference\\nbetween sedentary  and most lig ht jobs.\\n“Frequent” means occurring  from one-third to two-thirds of the time. \\nSince frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full rang e of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking , off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .  Sitting  may occur intermittently  during  the remaining  time. \\nThe lifting  requ irement for the majority  of light jobs can be accomplished\\nwith occasional, rather than frequent, stooping .  Many  unskilled light jobs\\nare performed primarily  in one location, with the ability  to stand being\\nmore critical than the ability  to walk.  They  require use of arms and hands\\nto grasp and to hold and turn objects, and they generally  do not require use\\nof the fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary\\nwork.\\n10.As the evidence documents that the claimant lacks the ability  to stand and\\nwork for 6 hours out of an 8-hour workday , s/he cannot, in fact, perform light\\nwork as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday .  As set forth in SSR 83-10, light work\\nentails “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the “primary difference\\nbetween sedentary and most light jobs.” (Emphasis added).  In order to be\\nable to frequently  lift or carry  objects weig hing  up to 10 pounds which is\\nrequired to perform light work, an individual must be able to stand or walk,\\noff and on, for approx imately  six hours out of an 8-hour day :\\n58\\nSince frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full range of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking,  off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .

Further, SSR 96-8p provides that:\\nin order for an individual to do a full range of work at a given exertional\\nlevel, such as sedentary , the individual must be able to perform\\nsubstantially all of the exertional and nonex ertional functions required in\\nwork at that level.  Therefore, it is nece ssary to assess the individual’s\\ncapacity  to perform each of these functions in order to decide which\\nexertional level is appropriate and whether the individual is capable of\\ndoing  the full rang e of work contemplated by  the ex ertional level.\\nId. (Emphasis added).\\n11.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can perform the full range of medium\\nwork is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law :  Medium work is defined in SSR 83-10 as follows:\\nThe regulations define medium work as lifting  no more than 50 pounds at\\na time with freque nt lifting or carry ing of objects weighing up to 25\\npounds.  A full range of medium work requires standi ng or walking , off\\nand on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours in an 8-hour workday  in order\\nto meet the requirements of frequent lifting or carry ing objects weig hing\\nup to 25 pounds.  As in light work, sitting  may occur intermittently  during\\nthe remaining  time.  Use of the arms and hands is necessary  to grasp, hold,\\nand turn objects, as opposed to the finer activities in much sedentary work,\\nwhich require precision use of the fingers as well as use of the hands and\\narms.\\nThe considerable lifting  required for the full range of medium work\\nusually  requires frequent bending -stooping  (Stooping  is a type of bending\\nin which a person bends his or her body  downward and forw ard by\\nbend ing the spine at the waist.) Flexibility  of the knees as well as the torso\\nis important for this activity.  (Crouching  is bending  both the legs and\\nspine in order to bend the body downward and forward .)  However, there\\nare a relatively  few occupa tions in the national economy  which require\\nexertion in terms of weig hts that must be lifted at times (or involve\\n59\\nequivalent exertion in pushing  or pulling ), but are performed primarily  in\\na sitting  position, e.g., taxi driver, bus driver, and tank-truck driver\\n(semiskilled jobs).  In most medium jobs, being on one’s feet for most of\\nthe workday  is critical. Being able to do frequent lifting  or carry ing of\\nobjects weig hing up to 25 pounds is often more critical than being able to\\nlift up to 50 pounds at a time.\\n12.Given the evidence of record that the claimant uses a cane, the ALJ’s finding\\nthat s/he can perform the exertional demands of light work cannot be\\nsustained.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday . Indeed, according  to the Commissioner’s\\npolicies, light work entai ls “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the\\n“primary difference between sedentary and mos t light jobs.”  Social Security\\nRuling  83-10 (empha sis added).  In order to be able to frequently  lift or carry\\nobjects weig hing up to 10 pounds which is requi red to perform light work, an\\nindividual must be able to stand or walk, off and on, for approximately six\\nhours out of an 8-hour day :\\nSince  frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full range of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking, off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .  Sitting  may occur intermittently  during  the remaining  time. \\nThe lifting  requirement for the majority  of light jobs can be accomplished\\nwith occasional, rather than frequent, stooping .  Many  unskilled light jobs\\nare performed primarily  in one location, with the ability  to stand being\\nmore critical than the ability  to walk.  They  require use of arms and hands\\nto grasp and to hold and turn objects, and they generally  do not require use\\nof the fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary\\nwork.\\nId.  An individual who uses a cane for ambulation cannot perform the\\nstanding , walking , and lifting  entailed in the performance of lig ht work.\\nThe regulations specifically  recognize that the “requirement to use a hand-\\nheld assistive device may . . . impact on the individual’s functional capacity\\nby virtue of the fact that one or both upper extremities are not available for\\nsuch activities as lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pullin g.”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(J)(4).  Social Security  Ruling  96-9p recog nizes that\\nthe ability to perform sedentary work may be impacted by the use of a cane.\\nSee SSR 96-9p (stating  that “the occupational base for an individual who must\\nuse [an assistive] device for balance because of significant involvement of\\nboth lower extremities (e.g., because of a neurolog ical impairment) may be\\nsignificantly  eroded”). While the use of such a device does not alway s impact\\nthe ability to perform sedentary  work in light of the “minimal lifting  and\\ncarry ing requirements of many sedentary  unskilled occupations,” this is not\\ntrue for light work, which entails frequent lifting  of up to 20 pounds.

STEP 4 - AB ILITY TO RETURN T O PAST  RELEVANT WORK\\n1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claiman t’s job as a *** is past relevant work is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  conside red past work performed more than five years\\nprior to the date of the decision [or date last insured] , in violation of 20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 416.960(b)(1)(i) and SSR 24-2p.\\nApplicable law.  The regulations define work experience as the skills and\\nabilities the claimant has acquired throug h prior work which shows the type of\\nwork you may be expected to do.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  The SSA\\nhas issued a final rule effective June 22, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to\\nthe Disability Adjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work,\\n89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024), 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5, 2024)\\n(deferring  effective date to J une 22, 2024).  \\nAmong  other provisions, the rule revises the definition of past relevant work\\nby reducing  the relevant work period from 15 years to five years.  This final\\nrule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability\\nreview cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial\\ndisability  sequential evaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no\\nlonger consider past work that started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar\\ndays to be past relevant work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii),\\n416.965(b)(1)(ii). \\nSSA makes these revisio ns in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and\\n416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years\\nthat was substantial gainful activity  and that lasted long enoug h for you to\\nlearn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We will not consider work to be past\\nrelevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar days\\n(see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consider past relevant work and work experience (see §\\n404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30 consecutive days,\\nincluding  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.  When we\\nconsider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period, or\\nwhether the work was full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\n61\\nactivity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthough the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntoward the time needed for you to learn to do the work. The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contractor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a) : \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. 404.1565(a), 416.965(a) from the prior\\ntext, “If you have no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for\\nbrief periods of time during  the five- year period, we generally  consider\\nthat these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as, “If you have no work\\nexperience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)( 1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear\\nperiod, we generally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the\\njustification for the rule is to allow individuals to focus on the most\\ncurrent and relevant information about their past work, better reflect the\\ncurrent evidence base on chang es over time in worke r skill decay  and job\\nresponsibilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service,\\nand reduce the burden on individuals. \\nPursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued SSR 24-2p,  Titles II and XVI: How\\nWe Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effec tive June 22, 2024, which rescinds\\nSSR 86-8, and rescinds  and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose\\nof the new ruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether  an individual\\nretai ns the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their\\npast relevant work and to explain the policy set forth in SSA’s regulations so\\nthat those regulations will be consistently  applied.   See SSR 24-2p, 2024 WL\\n3291790 (S.S.A. J une 6, 2024); 89 F ed. Reg . 48479 (J une 6, 2024).  \\nAccor ding to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured\\nfrom the date of the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  However, in\\nsome situations, the relevan t period is measured from an earlier date. This\\nruling  includes a table that provides g uidelines for common scenarios.  \\n3.The ALJ erred in failing  to comply  with SSR 24-2p, which applies to this\\ncase.\\nApplicable law .  SSA will apply  SSR 24-2p on and after its applicable date of\\nJune 22, 2024, in any case in which the agency  makes a determination or\\ndecision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for further\\nadministrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR 24-2p, SSA will\\napply  this ruling to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the\\ncourt’s remand.  \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant did not work\\nlong  enoug h to learn how to do the work.\\n62\\n5.The ALJ conceded in his/h er decision at step one of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess that the claimant was not engaged in substantial gainful activity , and\\ntherefore erred in finding  that the claimant can return to this work.\\n6.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant only did work\\nthat started and stopped in a period of fewer  than 30 calendar days during  the\\npast five-y ear period.\\nApplicable law .  SSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that was performed: \\n•within the past five y ears; \\n•was substantial g ainful activity  (SGA) and \\n•lasted long  enoug h for the individual to learn to do preform the work.  \\nSee 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)) and 416.960(b)(1)(i).  According  to SSR\\n24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that:\\nThe individual gained sufficient job experience to learn the techniques,\\nacquire information, and develop the facility  needed for averag e\\nperfo rmance in the job. The length of time this would take depends on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific\\nvocational preparation (SVP).\\nSSR 24-2p provides that work is not PRW  if it the work started and stopped in\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s, defined as:\\na period of 30 consecu tive days, including  weekends, starting  from the\\nfirst day of work. We generally  do not consider the total number of hours\\nor days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or\\npart-time. The 30 calendar days require ment is separate from the\\nconsideration of SGA or whether an individual worked long enoug h to\\nlearn  how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days may count toward\\nthe time needed for an individual to learn to do the work.\\n Moreover, if a claimant was self-employed or an independent contractor, SSA\\nwill consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type of work for 30\\ncalendar days even if individual work assig nments or contracts each lasted\\nfewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are provided in\\nSSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW  includes “gig\\necon omy” work such as an individual who completed 20 different shopping\\ntrips for a grocery delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or more\\nbecause the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even\\nthoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSSR 24-2p provides examples interpr eting the 30 calendar day requirement.  \\nThe ruling  lists the following  two ex amples:\\n63\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW  if it was perfor med at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample  2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year relevant  work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to her past relevant work as she\\nactually  performed it (or as genera lly performed) is not based on substantial\\nevidence.   \\nApplicable law:  There are two methods used to determine whether a\\nclaimant can perform his or her PRW  – whether the claima nt can perform the\\nwork as “actually  performed” or as “generally  performed in the national\\neconomy .”  SSR 24-2p states that “[a]s they actually performed the work”\\nlooks to whethe r the claimant retains the “RFC to perform the particular\\nfunctional demands peculiar to the work the individual did.” \\nIn evaluating  work as “generally  performed  in the national economy ,” SSA\\nlooks to whether the claimant “retains the capacity  to perform the\\noccupation’s functional deman ds as ordinarily  required throug hout the\\nnation al economy ,” based on descriptions of occupations from reliable\\nsources of job information to determine how occupati ons are generally\\nperformed. A vocational witness may also provide information about  how an\\noccupation is generally  perfor med in the national economy .

SSR 24-2p provides that statements by a claimant about past\\nwork is generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and\\nmental demands of such work.  However, if the claimant cannot provide this\\ninformation, with the claimant’s permission, SSA will attempt get it from\\nothers, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the claimant to\\ndescribe all of the work perfor med in the last 5 years (unless the job started\\nand stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days), including  the dates they worked,\\nthe duties they performed, any tools, machinery , and equipment they used and\\nthe amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carrying the individual\\ndid during  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\nSSR 24-2p provides that SSA determines whether an individual can perform\\ntheir past relevant work (PRW ) by considering whether the individual retains\\nthe RFC to meet the functional demands of any of their PRW , as they actual ly\\nperformed it, or as it is generally  performed in the national economy . This\\nRuling  explains the information SSA needs to make this determination:\\nTo determine whether an individual can perform PRW , we need\\ninformation about the physical and mental demands of PRW , particularly\\n65\\nas relevant to the individual’s RF C. This may  include:\\n \\n•detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental\\ndemands, and other job requirements; \\n•the dates work was performed; \\n•tools and machines used;\\n•the ex tent of supervision required, and\\n•a description of tasks and responsibilities.\\nIf more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, we will request\\nseparate descriptions of each  job the individual performed during  the relevant\\nperiod.\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, determination of the individual’s ability to do PRW\\nrequires careful consideration of:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no\\nlong er be met and the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those\\nrequirements;\\n•the individual’s RF C;  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corrob orative information from other\\nsources on the requirements of the work as actually  performed by the\\nindividual or as g enerally  performed in the economy .\\nThe ALJ’s decision that an individual is not disabled, based on the ability  to\\nperform PRW , must contain adequate rationale and finding s of fact. SSR 24-\\n2p provides:\\nA determination or decision that an individual is not disabled, based on\\ntheir ability  to perform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step\\nfour of the sequential evaluation process, must contain adequate rationale\\nand finding s.\\nSpecifically , in finding  that an individua l has the capacity  to perform PRW ,\\nthe determination or decision must:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\n66\\nperformed in the national economy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the\\nPRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .\\nUnder SSR 24-2p, the ALJ’s decision must contain adequate rationale and\\nfindings which “consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either\\nas the individual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .”  \\n10.The ALJ misclassified the streng th requirements of the claimant’s past\\nrelevant work by the lightest duties performed, when, in fact, it was actually  a\\ncomposite job which also entailed more strenuous duties.\\n   11.The ALJ erred in not recognizing that the claimant performed a  “composite\\njob” which entailed  the duties of two jobs as discussed in POMS DI\\n25005.020(B ) and thus committed legal error in finding  that s/he can return to\\nthe least strenuous of his/her past duties. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that, after comparing  the claimant’s\\nresidual functional capacity  with “the physical and mental demands of [his or\\nher] past relevant work,” if the claimant “can still do this kind of work,” the\\nclaimant is not disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(f), 416.920(f).  A composite\\njob in one which entails duties which are performed at different exertional\\nlevels.  \\nPOMS DI 25005.020 addresses past relevant work as performed by a claimant\\nand discusses composite jobs:\\nComposite jobs have significant elements of two or more occupations and\\nas such, have no counterpart in the DOT.\\n•The claimant’s PRW  may be a composite job if it takes multiple DOT\\noccupations to locate the main duties of the PRW  as described by the\\nclaimant.\\n•If you determine that PRW  was a composite job, you must explain\\nwhy.\\n•When comparing  the claimant’s RFC to a composite job as the\\nclaimant performed it, find the claimant capable of performing  the\\ncomposite job only  if he or she can perform all parts of the job.\\n•A composite job does not have a DOT counterpart, so do not evaluate\\nit at the part of step 4 considering  work “as generally  performed in the\\nnational economy .”\\n67\\n•At step 5 of sequential evaluatio n, a claimant may be able to use skills\\nhe or she gained from a skilled or semiski lled composite job to adjust\\nto other work. See Transferability  of Skills Assessment (TSA), DI\\n25015.017, for instructions on how to assess transferability  of skills.\\n12.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the impact of the claimant’s inability  to\\ntolerate stress on his/her abilit y to perform his/her past relevant highly\\nstressful work, as discussed in SSR 85-15 and SSR 24-2p. \\nApplicable law: SSR 24-2p provides that in determining  whether an\\nindivid ual is able to perform PRW , the ALJ may need to obtain detailed\\ninformation regarding  the work’s “mental demands, and other  job\\nrequirements” and the ALJ’s decision must consider the “mental demands of\\nthe PRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .”  \\nSSR 85-15 acknowledg es that “since mental illness is defined and\\ncharacteriz ed by maladaptive behavior, it is not unusual that the mentally\\nimpaired have difficulty  accomm odating to the demands of work and work-\\nlike setting s. Determining  whether these individuals will be able to adapt to\\nthe demands or “stress” of the workplace is often extremely  difficult.” The\\nruling  states it is “not intended to set out any presumptive limitations for\\ndisorders, but to emphasiz e the impor tance of thoroug hness in evaluation on\\nan individualiz ed basis.”  SSR 85-15 provides examples of how reactions to\\nthe demands of work stress can affect the ability  to perform PRW :\\nThe reaction to the demands of work (stress) is highly individualiz ed, and\\nmental  illness is characteriz ed by adverse responses to seeming ly trivial\\ncircumstances. The mentally  impaired may cease to functio n effectively\\nwhen facing  such demands as getting  to work regularly , having  their\\nperformance supervised, and remaining  in the workplace for a full day. A\\nperson may become panicked and develop palpitations, shortness of\\nbreath, or feel faint while riding  in an elevator; another may experie nce\\nterror and begin to hallucinate when approached by a strang er asking  a\\nquestion. Thus, the mentally  impaired may have difficulty  meetin g the\\nrequirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.\\nBecause response to the demands of work is highly individuali zed, the\\nskill level of a position is not necessarily  related to the difficulty  an\\nindividual will have in meeting  the demands of the job. A claimant’s\\ncondition may make performance of an unskilled job as difficult as an\\nobjectively  more demanding  job. For example, a busboy  need only  clear\\ndishes from tables. But an individual with a severe mental disorder may\\nfind unmanag eable the demands of making  sure that he removes all the\\ndishes, does not drop them, and gets the table  cleared promptly  for the\\nwaiter or waitress. Similarly , an individual who cannot tolerate being\\nsupervised may not be able to work even in the absence of close\\nsupervision; the knowledge  that one’s work is being  judg ed and evaluated,\\n68\\neven when the supervision is remote or indirect, can be intolerable for\\nsome mentally  impaired perso ns. Any impairment-related limitations\\ncreated by an individual’s response to demands of work, however, must be\\nreflected in the RF C assessment.\\nId. (emphasis in orig inal).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant has the RFC to perform  sedentary\\n[or light] work, his/her finding  that s/he is able to return to his/her past\\nrelevant work as a *** [state job], which is classified as light [or medium]\\nwork both as s/he performed it and as it was performed in the national\\neconomy , cannot be sustained.\\n14.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her  past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, conflicts with the AL J’s own RF C  finding s.\\n15.The ALJ erred in classify ing the claimant’s past releva nt work as a *** [state\\njob] as “light” [or “sedentary ”] work when it was, in fact, “medium” [or\\n“light” work] , both as he/she performed the work and as performed in the\\nnational economy  according  to the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-2p provi des that a claimant is considered “not\\ndisabled” who retains the RFC to perform either the actual functional\\ndemands and job duties of his/her particular past relevant job or the functional\\ndemands and job duties of the occupation as it is generally  required by\\nemploy ers throug hout the national economy .\\n16.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, directly  conflicts with the VE’s testimony , which the\\nALJ essentially  disreg arded in his/her decision.\\nH.STEP 5 - AB ILITY TO PERFORM OTHER WORK\\n1.As the claimant lacks any transferable skills, s/he cannot, in fact, perform\\nsemi-skilled work as a [ state job]  as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  Skills are acquired in a claimant’s past relevant work or in\\nrecent education that provides for direct entry into skilled work. SSR 00-4p. \\nThe Commissioner has specif ically determined that “unskilled work\\ncorresponds to an SVP of 1-2; semi-skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 3-\\n4; and skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 5-9 in the [Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles] ” and these “regulatory  definitions of skill levels are\\ncontrolling .” Id.\\nFurthermore, as set forth in Social Security  Ruing  83-10:\\nthe [ a]bility  to perform skilled or semiskilled work depends on the\\n69\\npresence of acquired skills which may  be transferred to such work from\\npast job ex perience above the unskilled level or the presence of recently\\ncompleted education which allows for direct entry  into skilled or\\nsemiskilled work . . . .\\nThis Ruling  further explains that in order to find that a claimant has\\ntransferable skills, the individual “must have performed work which is above\\nthe unskilled level of complex ity, must have identifiable skills, and must be\\nable to use these skills in specific skilled or semiskilled occupations within his\\nor her RF C.”\\nA claimant who cannot use his or her skills in other jobs  is considered to have\\nan unskilled work backg round.  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past\\nwork, we consider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them\\nin other skilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  And\\nif the claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n2.Since the ALJ determined that the claimant could perform semi-skilled work,\\nthe ALJ pursuant to SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14 must cite examples  of jobs\\nthat the claimant  could perform and the incidence of such jobs in the national\\neconomy .\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Ruling  83-11 provides that in those cases\\nwhere a claimant’s past relevant work included one or more skilled or semi-\\nskilled jobs and transferability of skills is material, the “finding  of fact\\nrequires identification of the work skills, examples of specific skilled or\\nsemiskilled occupations within the person’s RFC to which s/he or she can\\ntransfer skills (if any), and a statement of the incidence of such jobs in the\\nregion in which the person lives or in several regions of the country .”  Id.  The\\nALJ must ask the vocational witness to identify  examples of appropriate jobs\\nand to state the incidence of such  jobs in the national economy .  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1566, 416.966.  \\nSSR 83-14, applicable when a claimant has a combination of exertional and\\nnonex ertional impairments, provides that:\\n[w]henever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disabled, the determinatio n or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/job s the person can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.Since the testimony  of the VE supports a finding  that there is no work in the\\nnational economy  upon a proper consideration of all of the claimant’s\\nlimitations, the Appeals Council should award benefits.\\n70\\n4.The Appeals Council should find the claimant disabled based on the\\ntestimony  of the vocational ex pert.\\n5.The evidence of record documents that the claimant is disabled and unable to\\nperform the basic mental demands of unskilled work as described in SSR 85-\\n15, warranting  an award of benefits.\\nApplicable law : As set forth in SSR 85-15:\\nThe basic menta l demands of competitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry  out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supe rvision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations; and to deal with changes in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding  of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experien ce will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nExample 1:  A person whose vocational factors of age, education, and\\nwork experience would ordinarily  be considered favorable (i.e., very\\nyoung  age, unive rsity education, and highly skilled work experience)\\nwould have a severely limited occupational base if he or she has a mental\\nimpairment which causes a substantial loss of ability  to respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations.  A\\nfinding  of disability  would be appropriate.\\nSimilarly , SSR 96-9p states the following  regarding  the mental demands of\\nsedentary  work:\\nA substantial loss of ability  to meet any one of several basic work-related\\nactivities on a sustaine d basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or an\\nequivalent work schedule), will substantially  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and would justify a finding  of disability .  These mental\\nactiviti es are generally  required by competitive, remunerative, unskilled\\nwork:\\n•Understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n•Making  judgments that are commensurate with the functions of\\nunskilled work – i.e., simple work- related decisions.\\n•Responding  appropriately  to supervision, co-workers, and usual\\nwork situations.\\n•Dealing  with chang es in a routine work setting .\\nPOMS DI 25020.010, addressing  mental limitations, addresses “substantial\\n71\\nloss” as follows: \\n“Substantial loss” cannot be precisely  defined.  It does not necessarily\\nrelate to any particular adjective, number, or percent age.  In practical\\nterms, an individual has a substantial loss of ability  to perfo rm a basic\\nmental activity  when he or she cannot perform the particular activit y in\\nregular, competitive employ ment but, at best, could do so only in a\\nsheltered work setting  where special considerations and attentio n are\\nprovided. This requires professional judgment, on the basis of the\\nevidence in file in each case. The impairment in a claim of this type may\\nmeet or equal the listed medical criteria.  Therefore, before making  a\\ndetermination that includes vocational evaluation, the adjudicat or should\\ndiscuss the case with a psychiatrist or psycholog ist to learn whether a\\nsignificant part of the evidence had been previously  overlooked or\\nunderrated. . . .\\nEXCEP TION : In a few rare instances where a person’s vocatio nal\\nprofile is extrem ely adverse (e.g., closely  approaching  retiremen t age,\\nlimited education or less, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field\\nof unskilled  work that is now precluded by a mental impairment), a\\nfinding  of “disabled” may be appropri ate. (This would be adjudicated\\nunder the Lifetime Com mitments Special Medical-Vocational Profile. See\\nDI 25010.001B .3.).\\nId. (Emphasis in original).  See generally  the following  POMS addressing\\nmental impairments: DI 25015.020, 25020.001-25020.01 5, 25025.001, and\\n25025.030.\\n6.The ALJ erred in relying on the testimony  of a vocational expert which rebuts\\nthe finding  of disability directed by the Medical-Vocational Guidelines\\n(Grids).\\nApplicabl e law:  The Grids rules are conclusive and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted “rebuttable presumptions” of disability  that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10  directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was a\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational testimony  that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particula r individual’s\\nvocational factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disabled. However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\n72\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)). The Commissioner noted that since “there is\\nno provision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact\\nfor SSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations, “the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the direct ed conclusion of disability  was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.” Id.\\n7.The ALJ erred in relying on the VE’s testimony  that considered whether the\\nclaimant ’s need for [state limitation]  could be reasonably  accommodated by\\nemploy ers in deny ing this case.\\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court has held that the issue of reasonable\\naccommodation by employ ers is not relevant in a Social Security  case.

Keep Summarizing the document apart from answering the questionRefine these answers to ensure they are accurate and comprehensive based on the additional context provided:\\nIs there any law that can help a blind person?Additional context:\\nthe earning s average less than the secondary  guideline amount, the employ ee\\nis generally  presumed not engaged in SGA unless there is evidence showing\\n7 Subsi dized earnings are also discussed in SSR 83- 33, a t pages 37-38, infra.\\n36\\npotential engagement in SGA, or the claimant “appears to be in a position to\\ndefer compensati on, or by special arrang ement is able to suppress earning s[.]”\\nId. If such evidence is present, development is necessary to determine whether\\none of the other two tests for SGA is met. Where earning s fall between or are\\nequal to the specified primary  and secondary  amounts, an adjudicator will\\ngenerally  turn to the other tests for SGA.\\nThe seco nd test asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to\\nthat of unimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar\\noccupations. Under the second test, the individual’s work activity  is analy zed\\nin relation to the time, energ y, skills, and responsibility  involved in its\\nperformance. The issue is whethe r the work performed “is essentially  the\\nsame in quality and quantity  as that done by unimpaired individuals engaged\\nin the same or similar occupations as their means of livelihood.” Where the\\ncorrect answer is unclear, the agency  must “contact the employ er, the U.S.\\nEmploy ment Service, or other informe d sources in the community  for\\ninformation as to the time, energy, duties, and responsibilities of unimpaired\\nworkers doing  the same or similar work.” Id.\\nThe third test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the individual’s\\nwork activity , with reference to the prevailing pay scales of the community , is\\nclearly  worth more than the other wise applicable primary  amount listed in the\\nearning s guidelines.8 Id.\\nSSR 83-33 discusses the need for detailed documentation under the second\\nand third tests. The Ruling  further provides that a reasonable explanation as to\\nwhy work is not substantial will preclude a finding  of SGA pursuant to these\\ntests. Reasonable doubts are normally  to be resolved in favor of the claimant.\\nFinally , the Ruling  explains that unsuccessful work attempts are not SGA.\\nFor both the second and third tests of SGA, the Ruling  states that\\ndocumentation should go beyond the employee’s description of his or her\\nwork and include “a detailed description of how the work is performed by\\nunimpaired persons in the community , including  their remuneration, hours,\\nduties, and responsibilities.” Id. Such information should be soug ht from a\\nlocal employ ment service or other authoritative source. Also, under the\\nsecond and third tests, a reasonable explanation as to why earning s are not\\nsubstantial prevents a finding  of SGA.\\nAccording  to SSR 83-33, a finding  of SGA is inappropriate if there is a\\nreasonable explanation of why an employ ee’s earning s are not substantia l. An\\nexample of a reasonable explanation would be the employ ee’s inability  to\\nperform the full responsibilities of the job due to reduced pace or hours. “It\\n8 The tiered earnings scheme, with primary and secondary guidelines amounts, was discontinued beg inning\\nin 2001.

Id.\\n2.The ALJ erroneous ly concluded that the claimant’s self-employ ment\\nconstitutes SGA as set forth in SSR 83-34.\\nApplicabl e law: SSR 83-34 provides that work will be considered SGA if it\\nmeets one of three tests. The first test for self-employ ment concerns whether\\nthe individual renders significant services to and receives a substantial income\\nfrom the business. The second and third tests look to the comparab ility of the\\nwork to that of unimpaired people in similar businesses/occupations and to the\\nworth of the work activity . Id. The ALJ is required to apply  these tests in\\naccordance with the Ruling  and 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1575, 416.975.9\\nSSR 83-34 provides that work activity  must be in accordance with three tests\\nbefore it can be determined not to constitute SGA. However, if one test\\nindicates the work qualifies as SGA, the inquiry  ceases and the work activity\\nis deemed SGA without reg ard to the other tests.\\nThe first test focuses on whether the individual renders significant services to\\nand receives a substantial income from the business. To find SGA under the\\nfirst test, both conditions must be met: the provision of significant services to\\nand receipt of a substantial income from the business. According  to the\\nRuling , the services of someone engaged in a one-person business are\\nnecessarily  significant. The only question remaining  for such individuals\\nconcerns whether the income received is substantial. For businesses involving\\nthe services of two or more people, an “owner or partner will be found to be\\nrendering  significant services if he or she contributes more than half the total\\ntime required for management of the business, or renders manag ement\\nservices for more than 45 hours a mont h regardless of the total manag ement\\ntime required by the busine ss.” Id. A farm landlord performs significant\\nservices if he or she materially participates in crop or livestock production or\\nmanag ement. Material participation is explained in the regulations at 20\\nC.F.R. § 404.1082.\\nAn individual receives “substantial income” if: (1) the amount of “countable\\nincome” derived from the business on averag e for the calendar year exceeds\\nthe applicable earning s guideline; (2) the livelihood derived from the business\\nis comparable to that during  his or her pre-disability  period; or (3) the\\nlivelihood derived is comparable to that of unimpaired people making  a living\\n9 See also SSR 12- 1p (evaluation of SGA f or blind se lf-employed claimants).\\n38\\nin the same or similar businesses. Countable income is determined by\\ncalculating  the income representing  the person’s own productivity , which is\\ndone throug h figuring net income and then deducting  the reasona ble value of\\nany significant amount of unpaid help furnished by others, impairment-related\\nwork expenses, unincurred business expenses paid for by others, and certain\\nsoil bank payments. The Ruling  discusses the determination of the value of\\nthese deductions. Id.\\nIf averag e monthly  countable income does not exceed the applicable guideline\\namount,10 the individual may still receive “substantial income” from the\\nbusiness under the second standard if he or she continues to receive a\\nlivelihood comparable to that received for a number of years before disability .\\nThis standard is applicable where the business formed “the sole means of\\nlivelihood” during  the earlier years. The Ruling  cautions, moreover, that\\n“chronic illness or other special circumstances existing  from some time prior\\nto the individual’s becoming  disabled may indicate that his or her financial\\nsituation in that period should not be considered an indication of the\\nindividual’s standard of livelihood .” If that is the case, the third test for\\nsubstantial income would be “more pertinent.”\\nThe last test for substantial income indicates SGA will be found where the\\ncommunity  standard of livelihood for similar businesses is met, without\\nregard to the individual’s pre-disability  circumstances. SSR 83- 34 recog nizes\\nthat in determining  the community  standard, unrepresentative individuals\\nmust be excluded—for example, individuals whose “chronic illness accounts\\nfor a low level of income.”\\nThe second and third tests are discussed together by the Ruling . These look to\\nthe comparability  of the work to that of unimpaired people in similar\\nbusinesses and to the worth of the work activity , respectively . The second test\\nfor SGA asks if the individual’s work activity  is clearly  comparable to that of\\nunimpaired people making  their living  in the same or similar businesses.\\nUnder the second test for SGA, the individual’s  work activity  is assessed “in\\nterms of all relevant factors such as hours, skills, energ y output, efficiency,\\nduties, and responsibilities[ .]” SSR 83-34 provides that each factor must be\\ndescribed in detail by the adjudicator, showing  its contribution to the business.\\nIf this activity  is established by conclusive evidence to be comparable to that\\nof unimpaired people who: (1) reside in the same community ; (2) are engaged\\nin the same or similar businesses, with the type of self-employ ment being  the\\nsame; and (3) are so engaged as their means of livelihood, the individual may\\nbe considered to be performing  SGA. Inconclusive evidence, including\\ngeneral rather than specific descriptions of the relevant factors, “will result in\\na finding  that work performed is not SGA.” Doubts must be resolved in favor\\nof the claimant. Further, the comparison group must derive a standard of\\n10 Presumptive SGA amounts, upda ted yearly at: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/sga.html (Accessed May 1,\\n2024) .\\n39\\nliving  considered adequate for the community .\\nThe Ruling  acknowledg es that it might be necessa ry to develop the record\\nwith more information about the claimant’s activ ities than he or she can\\nprovide. “Contact, therefore, should be made with people having firsthand\\nknowledg e of the impaired individual’s work situation obtained  through\\nactual participation or observation.”\\nThe third and final test for the existence of SGA concerns whether the\\nindividual’s work activity  is clearly  worth more than the otherwise applicable\\namount listed in the earning s guidelines. The work activity  must be\\nconsidered either in relation to its value to the business or to the salar y an\\nowner would pay  an employ ee for the work.\\n3.The ALJ did not properly  averag e the claimant’s earnings  as set forth in SSR\\n83-35 in finding  that s/he eng aged in SGA.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-35 describes when and how averag ing countable\\nearning s or incom e is done for SGA determination purposes. It explains\\naverag ing in initial disability  cases and in continuing  disability  cases, except\\nduring  the reentitlement period.\\nIn determining  whether an employ ee’s averag e monthly  earning s\\npresumptively  indicate SGA by exceedin g the Earning s Guidelines,11 some\\nmethod is necessary  in cases where earnings  vary significantly  over time or\\nthe guidelines earnings level chang es. SSR 83-35 explains that in such cases\\n“it will be necessary  to average separately  the distinct periods of work\\ninvolved when there is a regulatory change in the SGA earning s level or there\\nis a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or earning s.”\\nSSR 83-35 diffe rentiates between earning s varying “somewhat” over the\\nmonths at issue and earning s that reflect a “significant chang e.” It explains\\nthat earning s or work activities varying “somewhat” require averagi ng “over a\\nnumber of months” before comparison with the Earning s Guidelines.12\\nSSR 83-55 states that certain situations require averag ing of earning s over\\ndistinct periods. It will be necessary  to averag e separately  the distinc t periods\\nof work involved when there is either (1) a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearnings level; or (2) a significant chang e in work patterns or income. The\\nfirst circumstance is straig htforward and can be determined by reference to\\nthe guidelines table, with earning s averaged over each period for which a\\ndifferent SGA level applies. Concerning  the second circumstance, the Ruling\\nstates:\\n11 Presumptive SGA a mounts, upda ted yearly, found a t: \\nhttp://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/ COL A/sga.html (Accessed Ma y 1, 2024) .  \\n12 The  Ruling does not define “somewhat.”\\n40\\nWhen there is significant chang e in work patterns or earning s during  the\\nperiod of work requiring  evaluation, earning s are not averag ed over the\\nentire period of work involved. When there is such a change, it would not\\nbe appropriate to averag e earning s over the entire period of work, since\\none period of work activity  may not be representative of the other period.\\nUnrepresentative periods of work involve separate and distinct work\\nefforts. When there is a significant chang e in work patterns or earning s,\\nthe earnin gs must be averag ed over each separate period of work involved\\nto determine if either effort was SGA.\\nThe implication of this Ruling  is that when there is no “separate and distinct\\nwork effort,” but rather the same job, earning s must be averaged over the\\nwhole relevant period.\\nSSR 83-55 explain s how averaging is applied to the income of self- employ ed\\nindividuals.  While similar in many  respects to the assessment of the earning s\\nof employ ed people, a determination of averag e monthly  income for self-\\nemploy ed individuals must “consider whether the period of time included in\\ndetermining  averag e monthly  ‘countable income’ is, in fact, representativ e of\\nthe individual’s financial situation during  the period involved in the SGA\\nissue.”  The Ruling explains that ordinarily  income is to be averag ed over the\\nentire period of work at issue, as with employ ees, except where there is an\\nSGA earning s level chang e or “a significant chang e in work patterns or\\nincome.” It is necessary  to averag e a self-employ ed “individual’s ‘countable\\nincome’ by figuring total ‘countable income’ over a representative period and\\ndividing  by the number of months in that period”- separately  averag ing\\ndistinct periods of work “when there is a regulatory  chang e in the SGA\\nearning s level or there is a sig nificant chang e in work patterns or income.”\\nSSR 83-35 also provides that engagement in SGA may be attributed to the\\nentire period. The Ruling  notes that where averag ed earning s or income\\nindicates SGA, “an individual may for purposes of the disability\\ndetermination be considered to have engaged continuously  in SGA  during the\\nentire period being  averag ed.”\\nFinally , SSR 83-35 addresses situations where a claimant has either stopped\\nworking  or has only recently  begun a pattern of work. In cases where a\\nclaimant is no longer working, but previously  worked for a continuous period,\\nearnings are to be averag ed over the actual period of work involved. On the\\nother hand, where the person has been empl oyed only a short time, such as 3\\nor 4 weeks, an evaluat ion must be made based on “the individual’s expected\\nwork pattern and earning s. If work was going on at the time of last contact\\nwith the individual, evaluation should be made in anticipation of its\\ncontinuance without other interruptions, in the absence of evidence clearly\\nindicating  the contrary .” A revision may be warranted, howev er, if subsequent\\nevidence shows the anticipated level of earning s did not materializ e.  Id.\\nFor details, see POMS DI  10505.015, Averag ing Countable Earning s.\\n41\\n4.The ALJ erroneously  concluded that the claimant’s employ ment constitutes\\nSGA without properly  considering  work-related subsidies as set forth in SSR\\n83-33.\\nApplicable law: SSR 83-33 provides that an individual’s “countable\\nearning s” are calculated by subtracting  from gross earning s the amount of any\\nsubsidiz ed earning s from the employ er and the amount of certain impairme nt-\\nrelated work expenses paid by the employ ee. The averag e monthly  countable\\nearning s are then compared to the applicable presumptive amount.\\nEarning s are considered subsidized when the employ er benevolently  pays\\nmore than the reasonable value of the employ ee’s services. SSR. The Ruling\\nindicates that usually the amount of a subsidy  can be determined by finding\\nsimilar work performed by unimpaired individuals in the community  in terms\\nof time, energ y, skills, and responsibility , and estimating  the value of the\\nclaimant’s services according  to the prevailing  pay scale for such work. Id.\\nOtherwise, resort may be had to “gross indications of a lack of productivity ;\\nfor example, when unusual supervision or assistance is required in the\\nperformance of simple  tasks, or the employ ee is extremely  slow, inefficient or\\notherwise unproductive.” Id. The Ruling  emphasiz es it is the claimant’s\\nproductivity , not the financial condition of the employ er’s business, that\\ndetermines the existence and amount of any subsidy . Id. Still, the Ruling  lists\\ncircumstances, the presence of any of which “indicate the strong  possibility  of\\na subsidy ”:\\n•The employ ment is “sheltered,”\\n•Childhood disability  is involved,\\n•Mental impairment is involved,\\n•There appears to be a marked discrepancy  between the amount of pay\\nand the value of the services,\\n•The employ er, employee, or other interested party  alleg es that the\\nemploy ee does  not fully  earn his or her pay (e.g., the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work),\\n•The nature and severity  of the impairment indicate that the employ ee\\nreceives unusual help from others in doing  the work,\\n•The employ ee is involved in a government-spon sored job training  and\\nan employ ment prog ram.\\nWhere an employ er cannot provide an adequate explanation of how a subsidy\\nwas calculated, the agency  must question the employer in regard to the need\\nfor the claimant’s services and the relationship of his or her pay to those\\nservices.  Id.  For more details, see POMS DI 10505.010(A) Determining\\nCountable Earning s, Subsidies.\\n5.The AL J erred by  counting  earning s from an unsuccessful work attempt.\\nApplicable law: In accordance with the unsuccessful work attempt (UW A)\\nrule discussed in SSR 83-34 and SSR 83-35, work activity  does not\\n42\\ndemonstra te an ability  to engage in SGA if, after working  no more than six\\nmonths, the individual involuntarily  discontinues or reduces such work  below\\nthe SGA level for reasons relating  to his or her impairment. The rule applies\\nto both employ ees and self-employ ed individuals. Id. See also 20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1574(c)(1), 416.974(c)(1).  The regulations define an UWA as work that\\na claimant is forced to stop after a short time because of his or her\\nimpairments.  Id.  SSR 84-25 prov ides that the UWA must be preceded by a\\nperiod when the claimant is either not working or performing  work below the\\nSGA level. A claimant can have a series of UWAs: “each continuous\\nperilosingrated by significant breaks as described, may be an UWA as long as\\ncriteria as to duration and conditions of work are met. . . .”  \\nIf the work lasted less than six months, it is an UWA if the claimant stopped\\nor reduced work earning s below SGA level as a result of the impairment or\\nthe removal of “special conditions that took into account your impairment and\\npermitted you to work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1574(c)(3), 416.974(c)(3).  Work\\nthat lasted more than six months at the SGA level is not “an unsuccessful\\nwork attempt regardless of why it ended or was reduced below [SGA]  level.” \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1574(c)(4), 416.974(c)(4).\\n6.Work performed for fewer than 30 calend ar days is not considered past\\nrelevant work, even if it was performed at the SGA level.  \\nUnder revised regulations, SSA will also no longer consider past work that\\nstarted and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days to be past relevant work. \\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.965(b)(1)(ii).  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) specifically  provides:\\n(ii) 30 calendar days . When we consider past relevant work and work\\nexperience (see § 404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30\\nconsecutive days, including  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.\\nWhen we consider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do\\nnot consider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period,\\nor whether the work was full-time or part-time. The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\nactiv ity or whether you worked long enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthoug h the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntowa rd the time needed for you to learn to do the work.  The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contra ctor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSee also SSR 24-2p (also providing  that work is not PRW  if it the work\\nstarted and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar day s).  \\nSSR 24-2p explains that if a claimant was self-emp loyed or an independent\\ncontractor, SSA will consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type\\n43\\nof work for 30 calendar days even if individual work assignments or contracts\\neach lasted fewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are\\nprovided in SSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW\\nincludes “gig economy ” work such as an individual who completed 20\\ndifferent shopping  trips for a grocery  delivery  service over a period of 30\\ncalendar days or more because the individual did the same job for at least 30\\ncalendar days even thoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped\\nwithin a period of fewer than 30 calendar days. SSR 24-2p provides two\\nexamples interpreting  the 30 calendar day  requirement:\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW if it was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample 2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during the 5-year relevant work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ did not address  impairment-related work expenses (IRWE) as\\nrequired as set forth in SSRs 83-33 and 84-26.\\nApplicable law: SSR 84-26 explains in detail SSA policy  regarding  IRWE\\nfor people who meet the SSA definition of disability . Under certain\\ncircumstances, an individual’s expenses are deducted from his or her income\\nwhen determining  whether that income reflects SGA.\\nThe cost of certain items and services can be deducted from an impaired\\nperson’s earning s when determining  SGA . Generally , these must be items and\\nservices the person needs in order to work, althoug h they may simul taneously\\nbe required for normal daily  activiti es. SSR  84-26 specifies that where an\\nIRWE otherwise qualifies, it is irrelevant that the equipment or service “is\\nalso needed to enable the indivi dual to carry  out normal daily  functions[ .]”\\nThe entire amount of the expense is deductible, without any reduction.\\nAllowable amounts are subject to reasonable limits, and to qualify  the\\npayments for the items and services must have been made by the impaired\\nindividual.\\nSSR 84-26 discusses in detail qualify ing expenses in six major categ ories and\\nprovides multiple examples in relation thereto and explains what showing  of\\nnecessity , if any, is required for each categ ory. These six major categ ories are\\n44\\n(1) attendant care services; (2) medical devices; (3) prostheses; (4) other\\nequipment; (5) routine drugs and routine medical services; and (6) similar\\nitems and services. Multiple examples are set forth of services and equipment\\nthat are deductible in appropriate circumstances . No separate showing  of\\nnecessity  is requir ed with regard to prostheses, whereas medical devices\\nqualify  when they are primarily  used for a medical purpose and are not\\ngenerally  useful to healthy  individua ls. However, the needs met by attendant\\ncare services must be “essential” and the services shown necessary  to enable\\nthe person to work. Similarly , to qualify  as “other equipment” an item must be\\nneeded for performing  required job tasks, “or to move from home to mode of\\ntransportation, or to control the disabli ng condition at home or in the work\\nsetting  so as to be able to function in a work activity .” Routine drugs and\\nmedical services, as well as similar items and services, must also be necessary\\nfor enabling  the individual to work.\\nSSR 84-26 clarifies that the impaired individual must be the one who pays the\\ncost of the equipment or services. In other words, the expense “has not been,\\ncannot be, and will not be, reimbursed by any source for the expense.”\\nFurther, payment must be made in “cash,” which includes checks or other\\nforms of money  but not pay ment in-kind. Proof of pay ment must be provided.\\nSSR 84-26 also caution s that the deductible amount of IRWE “is subject to\\nreasonable limits”:\\nGenerally , the amount paid for medical services, medical device...,\\nprostheses, and similar medically -related items and services will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it is no more than the Medicare prevailing  charg e\\nestabl ished for the same item or service in the individual’s locale under\\nPart B of title XVIII of the Social Security  Act (Health Insurance for the\\nAged and Disabled).\\nPrevailing  charg e information is available from individual Medicare carriers\\nthroug h Social Security  district offices. If the amount paid for an item or\\nservice exceeds the Medicar e prevailing  charg e in the individual’s locale, an\\namount equal to the prevailing  charg e will be deducted from earni ngs.  If the\\nimpaired individual wishes  to establish the reasonableness of the amount paid,\\nhe or she may rebut the prevailing  charg e guidelines by demonst rating  that the\\namount paid is consistent with the standard or normal charg e for the same or\\nsimilar item or service in his or her community .  If the reported item or\\nservice is not listed in the Medicare guidelines, the amount paid will be\\nconsidered reasonable if it does not exceed the standard or normal charge for\\nthe same or similar item or service in the impaired individual’s community .\\nAdditionally , when IRWE deductions are taken, SGA is ordinar ily determined\\nby focusing on earnings rather than the value of services rendered.  The\\nRuling  notes that in cases involving  IRWE deductions, the SGA decision will\\ngeneral ly be based strictly  on the individual’s earning s rather than the value of\\nservices the individual rendered. There is an exception, howev er: “the\\n45\\nsituation in which a person is in a position to control or manipulate the\\namount of his or her earning s, e.g., the person is self-employ ed and the value\\nof services rendered is clearly  worth an amount  greater than the earning s\\nreceived.”\\nFinally , SSR 84-26 explains that the provision regarding  IRWE deductions\\ndoes not apply  to determinations of whether a month of “services” is\\ncharg eable for trial work period purp oses. “In other words, deductions will\\nnot be made to determine whether a person’s monthly  earning s can be reduced\\nto $75 or less.”  Id. \\nFor more details, see POMS DI 10520.001 Impairment-Related Work\\nExpenses (I RWE).\\n8.The ALJ erred by excluding the blind claimant’s income related to vending\\nmachine operation when determining  whether SGA was being  performed.\\nApplicable law: SSR 12-1p discusses the treatment of income that blind self-\\nemploy ed vendors receive under the Randolph-Sheppard Act (and similar\\nState programs) from vending  machines that are located on the same property ,\\nbut are not serviced, operated, or maintained by the blind vendor.13  This\\nincome is subtracted from the person’s income before the total is compared to\\nthe applicable guideline as it is not a measure of his or her own productivity . \\nSee also 20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1584, 416.984.\\nB.   STEP 2 - SE VERE IMPAIRM ENT\\n1.As the record includes the presence of signs and laboratory  finding s, the\\nALJ’s finding  that the claimant does not have a medically  determin able\\nimpairment is not supported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law: The Social Secu rity Act states that the impairment(s) must\\nresult  from “anatomical, physiolog ical or psycholog ical abnormalities which\\nare demonstrable by medically  acceptable clinical and laboratory  diagnostic\\ntechniques.” 42 U.S.C. § 423(d). The impairment(s) “must be established by\\nobjective medica l evidence from an acceptable medical source [,]” not a\\nclaimant’s “statement of symptoms, a diagnosis, or a medical opinion[ .]” 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1521, 416.921. \\nObjective medical evidence is defined as signs, laboratory  findings, or both.\\n20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1502, 416.902.  Signs are “one or more anatomical,\\nphysiolog ical, or psycholog ical abnormalities that can be observed, apart from\\nyour statements (symptoms).

SSR 16-3p “explains that we\\nwill consider  symptoms and functional limitations to determine whether an\\nimpairment is severe unless the objective medical evidence alone establishes a\\nsevere [medically  determinable impairment]  or combination of impairments\\nthat meets our duration requirement.” Id.  SSR 16-3p also clarifies that an\\nindividual’s  symptoms alone are not enoug h to establish the existence of a\\nphysical or mental impairment or disability , and that we will not find an\\nindividual disabled based on alleg ed sy mptoms alone.” Id.  \\nFor more detail, s ee POMS DI  24501.021: Evaluating  Symptoms.\\n2.The ALJ erred in finding  that the claimant’s condition was not present prior to\\nhis/her date last insured as s/he presented evidence bearing on his/her\\ncondition prior to the date last insured as required by  SSR 74-8c.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 74-8c adopts the district court’s opinion rendered in\\nDiaz v. Sec’y , No. 972-70 (D.P.R.  Dec.  15, 1972).14 The Ruling  introduces\\nthe opinion with a summary , stating  the claimant “failed to produce any\\nmedical evidence [bearing ] on his condition prior to September 30, 1962,\\nwhen he last met the insured status requirement[ .]”\\nThrough the adopted opinion, the Ruling  provides that a disability  claim may\\nreasonably  be denied where a claimant has failed to produce any medi cal\\nevidence (either in the form of medical testimony  or records) that bears on the\\nclaimant’s condition during the period at issue. Note: The court did not state\\nthat there must be evidence dating from prior to the date last insured, only that\\nevidence must bear upon the claimant’s condition during  this period. It should\\n14 In Diaz, no medical evidence having “any bearing on plaintiff’s condition prior” to his date last insured\\nwas presented. See SSR 74-8c. The court noted there was only a statement from the claimant, made two years\\nprior to the alleged onset date, alleging he had been told that he had stomach and pancreatic conditions. Unde r\\nthese circumstances, the court held the SSA had reasonably found the evidence did not establish disability\\nduring the period at issue. The court observed that a claimant bears the burde n of establishing disability, and\\nthat evidence indicating an impairment either began or reach ed disabling severity after expiration of the\\nclaimant’s insured status cannot serve to establish disability. Id.\\n47\\nalso be borne in mind that expiration of insured status does not affect the\\nviability  of a concurrent SSI claim. However, evidence of an impairmen t that\\neither began or reached disabling  severity  after expiration of the claimant’s\\ninsured status cannot serve to establish disability .\\n3.The ALJ did not follow the “slig ht abnormality ” standard in finding  that the\\nclaimant’s *** [ state impairment]  is non-severe . \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant’s *** [state impairment]  is not severe is\\nnot supported by  the evidence of record and inconsistent with SSR 85-28.\\n5.The AL J’s finding  that the claimant did not have any  severe impairment is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\nApplicable law: The claimant must have a severe impairment.  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1522(a), 416.922(a) states that a non-severe impairment “is not severe if\\nit does not significantly  limit” a claimant’s physical or mental activity  to\\nperform basic work activities.  Basic work activities mean the “abilities and\\naptitudes necessary  to do most jobs.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1522(a), 416.922(a). \\nThese include physical functions, such as walking , standin g, sitting , lifting ,\\npushing, pulling , reaching , carry ing, or handling ; capacities for seeing ,\\nhearing , and speaking ; understanding , carry ing out, and remembering  simple\\ninstructions; use of judgment; respon ding appropriately  to supervision, co-\\nworkers, and usual work situations; and dealing  with changes in a routine\\nwork setting . Id.   \\nMost circuits have adopted a slight abnormality  standard for severity , holding\\nthat an impairment is not severe if it is only a slight abnormality  which has\\nsuch a minimal effect on the claimant that it would not be expected to\\ninterfere with his or her ability to work, irrespective of age, education, or\\nwork experience.

SSA also makes a conforming change to the endocrine disorders\\nbody system to comport with the change it proposed to 20 C.F.R. §§ 416.926a(m), 404.1526a (m), to be\\nconsistent with these final rules.\\n49\\nbe found in three way s:\\n(1)The claimant has “an impairment that is described in appendix  1,” but\\ndoes not “exhibit one or more of the finding s specified in the particular\\nlisting ,” or exhibits “all of the finding s, but one or more of the finding s is\\nnot as severe as specified in the particular listing ” and the claima nt has\\n“other finding s related to your impairment that are at least of equal\\nmedical sig nificance to the required criteria.” or\\n(2)The claimant has “an impairment(s) that is not described in appendix 1,”\\nbut in comparing  the “findings with those for closely  analog ous listed\\nimpairments,” they are “at least of equal medical significance to those of a\\nlisted impairment,” or\\n(3)The claimant has “a combination of impairments, no one of which meets a\\nlisting ,” but in comparing  the “finding s with those for closely  analog ous\\nlisted impairments,” the finding s “related to your impairments are at least\\nof equal medical sig nificance to those of a listed impairment.” \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1526(b), 416.926(b).\\nIn determining  equivalence, SSA considers “all evidence in your case record\\nabout your impairment(s) and its effects on you that is relevant to this\\nfinding ” and the “opinion given by one or more medical or psycholog ical\\nconsult ants designated by the Commissioner.” 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1526(c),\\n416.926(c). \\nSSR 17-2p provides that in order to find medical equivalence, the record must\\ncontain one of the following  evidence supportive of the medical equivalence\\nfinding s: (1) a finding  by a State agency medical or psycholog ical consultant;\\n(2) ME evidence obtained either live or by interrog atories at the hearing  level;\\nor (3) a report from the Appeals Council’s medical support staff. See also\\nPOMS DI 24508.010(F )(6) (“Impairment or Combination of Impairments\\nEqualing  a Listing  – Medical Equivalence”)\\n3.The ALJ erred in rejecting  the opinion of the medical expert (ME) that the\\nclaimant’s impairments were medically  equivalent to a listed impairment\\nwithout asking  the ME to identify  the medical evidence in the record that\\nsupports the ME’s opinion as required by  SSR 17-2p.\\nApplicable law. Social Security  Ruling 17-2p, effective March 27, 2017,\\napplies to all pending claims, not only to claims filed on and after March 27,\\n2017, and replaces SSR 96-6p. SSR 17-2p states that, while at the initial and\\nreconsideration levels medical equivalence is determined by medical and/or\\npsycholog ical consultants, at the hearing  level it is ALJs “and some attorney\\nadvisors” who determine medi cal equivalence. To assist in the evaluation,\\nadjudicators “may ” request and consider medical expert evidence.  Similarly ,\\nwhere the Appeals Council issues a decis ion, it “may  ask its medical support\\n50\\nstaff  to help decide whether an individual’s impairment(s) medically  equals a\\nlisting .”\\nSSR 17-2p prohibits an adjudicator from finding  that a claimant’s\\nimpairments are medically  equivalen t to a listed impairment unless a medical\\nconsultant, psycholog ical consultant, medical expert, or Appeal s Council\\nmedical support staff opines that the claimant’s impairments(s) medic ally\\nequal the listing .  However, under the Ruling , an ALJ or the Appeals Council\\nare not required to obtain an opinion from a medical expert about medical\\nequivalence if the ALJ or the Appeals Council believes that the evidence does\\nnot reasonably  support a medical equivalence finding.  Further, an ALJ may\\nnot rely on a medical expert’s conclusory  opinion that a claimant’s\\nimpairment(s ) medically  equal the listing , but “must ask the ME to identify\\nmedical evidence in the record that supports the ME’s” opinion that a listing\\nis medically  equaled.\\nIn addition, if an ALJ determin es that a claimant’s impairments medically\\nequal the listing , the ALJ “must articulate how the record establishes medical\\nequival ency using  one of the three methods specified in 20 C.F.R. 404.1526\\nand 416.926.”  If an ALJ finds that a claimant’s impairments do not medically\\nequal a listing , that finding  alone is generally  sufficient articul ation for the\\nfinding .\\nD.

A medical assessmen t of what an\\nindividua l can do in a work setting  in spite of the functional limitations\\nand environmental restrictions imposed by all of his or her medi cally\\ndeterminable impairment(s).

SSR 85-15 provides that:\\n[t]he basic mental demands of com petitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supervision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations ; and to deal with chang es in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial  loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experience will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nSSR 85-16 cautions that a conclusion an individ ual can perform SGA is “not\\nto be inferred merely  from the fact that the mental disorder is not of listing\\nseverity.”  Id.  Further, the Ruling  provides that determining  mental RFC\\ninvolves the consider ation of evidence including : (1) all relevant history ,\\nfinding s and observations from medical sources; (2) reports of daily  living\\nand work activities; (3) third-party  testimony  regarding  performance and\\nbehavior; and (4) reports from workshops, group homes, or similar entities. \\nId.\\nThe Commissioner’s Ruling s demonstrate the need for presen tation of a\\nspecific, valid rationale supporting  any finding  that an individual’s\\nnonex ertional limitations do not signific antly limit basic work skills.  In\\n54\\naccordance with SSR 83-14, in cases involving  a combination of exertional\\nand nonex ertional impa irments, “[t]he usual requirements apply  for a clear,\\npersuasive, orderly  rationale.  There must be finding s of fact and recitation  of\\nthe evidence which supports each finding .” Likewise, SSR 85-15\\n“emphasiz e[s] the importance of thoroughness in evaluation on an\\nindividualiz ed basis” where a mental impairment is present.\\n4.The ALJ’s RFC assessment is deficient  as a matter of law because instead of\\ndetermining  the claimant’s ability  to perform basic work-related activities, the\\nALJ cited to the four factors set forth in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a\\nwhich are part of the psy chiatric review technique evaluation.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 96-8p provides that in assessing  a claimant’s RFC, the\\nALJ is required to make finding s regarding  whether the claimant can: (1)\\nunderstand, carry out, and remember simple instructions; (2) respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations; and (3)\\ndeal with chang es in a routine work setting .  The four factors set forth in 20\\nC.F.R. §§ 404.1520a, 416.920a are part of the Psychiatric Review Technique\\nevaluation and are not suffici ently detailed to constitute ultimate RFC\\nfinding s.  As set forth in SSR 96-8p:\\nThe psychiatric  review technique described in 20 C.F.R. 404.1520a and\\n416.920a and summariz ed on the Psychiatric Review Technique Form\\n(PRTF ) requires adjudicators to assess an individual’s limitations and\\nrestrictions from a mental impairment(s) in categ ories identified in the\\n“parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria of the adult mental disorders\\nlisting s.  The adjudicator must remember that the limitations identified in\\nthe “parag raph B” and “parag raph C” criteria are not an RFC assessment\\nbut are used to rate the severity  of mental impai rment(s) at steps 2 and 3\\nof the sequential evaluation process.  The mental RFC assessment used at\\nsteps 4 and 5 of the sequential evaluation process requir es a more detailed\\nassessment by itemiz ing various functions contained in the broad\\ncateg ories found in parag raphs B and C of the adult mental disorder\\nlisting s in 12.00 of the Listing  of Impairments and summariz ed on the\\nPRTF.\\n5.The ALJ’s mental RFC assessment is deficient as a matter of law because\\nthe ALJ did not [account for/build upon]  the finding s made as part of the\\npsychiatric review technique evauation.\\n6. The ALJ failed to account for his/her PRTF findings in the RFC\\nassessment, such as a moderate limitation in interacting with others as the\\nALJ did not address interacti on with supervisors, co-workers and/or the\\npublic.\\nApplicable law:  As “[t]he mental RFC assessment used at steps  4 and 5\\nof the sequential evaluation process requires a more detailed assessment”\\nthan the Psychiatric Review Technique evaluation, SSR 96-8p, the ALJ\\n55\\ncannot overlook or fail to expand upon the finding s made as part of that\\nevaluation.

Althoug h a sedentary\\njob is defined as one that involves sitting , a certain amount of walking  and\\nstanding  is often necessary  in carry ing out job duties.  Jobs are sedentary\\nif walking  and standing  are required occasionally  and other sedentary\\ncriteria are met.  “Occasionally ” means occurring  from very little up to\\none-third of the time and would generally  total no more than about 2 hours\\nof an 8-hour workday .  Sitting would generally  total about 6 hours of an 8-\\nhour workday . Unskilled sedentary  work also involves other activities,\\nclassified as “nonex ertion al,” such as capacities for seeing , manipulation,\\nand understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  dismissed the claimant’s need for an assistive device\\nbecause of the lack of a prescription. \\nApplicable law.

A full range of medium work requires standi ng or walking , off\\nand on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours in an 8-hour workday  in order\\nto meet the requirements of frequent lifting or carry ing objects weig hing\\nup to 25 pounds.  As in light work, sitting  may occur intermittently  during\\nthe remaining  time.  Use of the arms and hands is necessary  to grasp, hold,\\nand turn objects, as opposed to the finer activities in much sedentary work,\\nwhich require precision use of the fingers as well as use of the hands and\\narms.\\nThe considerable lifting  required for the full range of medium work\\nusually  requires frequent bending -stooping  (Stooping  is a type of bending\\nin which a person bends his or her body  downward and forw ard by\\nbend ing the spine at the waist.) Flexibility  of the knees as well as the torso\\nis important for this activity.  (Crouching  is bending  both the legs and\\nspine in order to bend the body downward and forward .)  However, there\\nare a relatively  few occupa tions in the national economy  which require\\nexertion in terms of weig hts that must be lifted at times (or involve\\n59\\nequivalent exertion in pushing  or pulling ), but are performed primarily  in\\na sitting  position, e.g., taxi driver, bus driver, and tank-truck driver\\n(semiskilled jobs).  In most medium jobs, being on one’s feet for most of\\nthe workday  is critical. Being able to do frequent lifting  or carry ing of\\nobjects weig hing up to 25 pounds is often more critical than being able to\\nlift up to 50 pounds at a time.\\n12.Given the evidence of record that the claimant uses a cane, the ALJ’s finding\\nthat s/he can perform the exertional demands of light work cannot be\\nsustained.\\nApplicable law:  A key component of all light jobs is the ability  to stand and\\nwalk during  most of the workday . Indeed, according  to the Commissioner’s\\npolicies, light work entai ls “a good deal of walking or standing, ” which is the\\n“primary difference between sedentary and mos t light jobs.”  Social Security\\nRuling  83-10 (empha sis added).  In order to be able to frequently  lift or carry\\nobjects weig hing up to 10 pounds which is requi red to perform light work, an\\nindividual must be able to stand or walk, off and on, for approximately six\\nhours out of an 8-hour day :\\nSince  frequent lifting  or carry ing requires being  on one’s feet up to two-\\nthirds of a workday , the full range of light work requires standing  or\\nwalking, off and on, for a total of approx imately  6 hours of an 8-hour\\nworkday .  Sitting  may occur intermittently  during  the remaining  time. \\nThe lifting  requirement for the majority  of light jobs can be accomplished\\nwith occasional, rather than frequent, stooping .  Many  unskilled light jobs\\nare performed primarily  in one location, with the ability  to stand being\\nmore critical than the ability  to walk.  They  require use of arms and hands\\nto grasp and to hold and turn objects, and they generally  do not require use\\nof the fingers for fine activities to the extent required in much sedentary\\nwork.\\nId.  An individual who uses a cane for ambulation cannot perform the\\nstanding , walking , and lifting  entailed in the performance of lig ht work.\\nThe regulations specifically  recognize that the “requirement to use a hand-\\nheld assistive device may . . . impact on the individual’s functional capacity\\nby virtue of the fact that one or both upper extremities are not available for\\nsuch activities as lifting , carry ing, pushing , and pullin g.”  20 C.F.R. Pt. 404,\\nSubpt. P, App. 1, § 1.00(J)(4).  Social Security  Ruling  96-9p recog nizes that\\nthe ability to perform sedentary work may be impacted by the use of a cane.\\nSee SSR 96-9p (stating  that “the occupational base for an individual who must\\nuse [an assistive] device for balance because of significant involvement of\\nboth lower extremities (e.g., because of a neurolog ical impairment) may be\\nsignificantly  eroded”). While the use of such a device does not alway s impact\\nthe ability to perform sedentary  work in light of the “minimal lifting  and\\ncarry ing requirements of many sedentary  unskilled occupations,” this is not\\ntrue for light work, which entails frequent lifting  of up to 20 pounds. See also\\n60\\nPOMS DI 25015.020(B )(6) (addressing  “Medically  required hand-held\\nassistive device”).\\nG. STEP 4 - AB ILITY TO RETURN T O PAST  RELEVANT WORK\\n1.The ALJ’s finding  that the claiman t’s job as a *** is past relevant work is not\\nsupported by  substantial evidence.\\n2.The ALJ improperly  conside red past work performed more than five years\\nprior to the date of the decision [or date last insured] , in violation of 20 C.F.R.\\n§§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 416.960(b)(1)(i) and SSR 24-2p.\\nApplicable law.  The regulations define work experience as the skills and\\nabilities the claimant has acquired throug h prior work which shows the type of\\nwork you may be expected to do.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  The SSA\\nhas issued a final rule effective June 22, 2024: Intermediate Improvement to\\nthe Disability Adjudication Process: Including How We Consider Past Work,\\n89 Fed. Reg. 27653 (April 18, 2024), 89 Fed. Reg. 48138 (June 5, 2024)\\n(deferring  effective date to J une 22, 2024).  \\nAmong  other provisions, the rule revises the definition of past relevant work\\nby reducing  the relevant work period from 15 years to five years.  This final\\nrule also changes the relevant work period SSA uses for continuing  disability\\nreview cases to five years to align with the chang es being  made to the initial\\ndisability  sequential evaluation process.  Under the rule, SSA will also no\\nlonger consider past work that started and stopped in fewer than 30 calendar\\ndays to be past relevant work. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii),\\n416.965(b)(1)(ii). \\nSSA makes these revisio ns in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560, 404.1565, 416.960, and\\n416.965, as follows:\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i), 461.960(b)(1)(i) :\\nPast relevant work is work that you have done within the past five years\\nthat was substantial gainful activity  and that lasted long enoug h for you to\\nlearn to do it (see § 404.1565(a)).  We will not consider work to be past\\nrelevant work if you started and stopped it in fewer than 30 calendar days\\n(see § 404.1560(b)(1)(ii)). \\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(ii), 416.960(b)(1)(ii) :\\nWhen we consider past relevant work and work experience (see §\\n404.1565), 30 calendar days means a period of 30 consecutive days,\\nincluding  weekends, starting  from the first day of work.  When we\\nconsider whether work lasted 30 calendar days, we generally  do not\\nconsider the total number of hours or days worked during  that period, or\\nwhether the work was full-time or part-time.  The 30 calendar days\\nrequirement is separate from the consideration of substantial gainful\\n61\\nactivity  or whether you worked long  enoug h to learn how to do the work,\\nalthough the work performed during  the 30 calendar days may count\\ntoward the time needed for you to learn to do the work. The 30 calendar\\ndays requirement also applies if you were self-employ ed or an\\nindependent contractor; we will consider whether you were engaged in the\\nsame type of work for 30 calendar days, even if individual work\\nassig nments or contracts each lasted fewer than 30 calendar day s.\\n20 C.F .R. §§ 404.1565(a), 416.945(a) : \\nThe final rule revises in 20 C.F.R. 404.1565(a), 416.965(a) from the prior\\ntext, “If you have no work experience or worked only ‘off and on’ or for\\nbrief periods of time during  the five- year period, we generally  consider\\nthat these do not apply ,” to read in the final rule as, “If you have no work\\nexperience or you did work that started and stopped in a period of fewer\\nthan 30 calendar days (see § 404.1560(b)( 1)(ii)) during  the five-y ear\\nperiod, we generally  consider that these do not apply .” SSA states the\\njustification for the rule is to allow individuals to focus on the most\\ncurrent and relevant information about their past work, better reflect the\\ncurrent evidence base on chang es over time in worke r skill decay  and job\\nresponsibilities, reduce processing  time and improve customer service,\\nand reduce the burden on individuals. \\nPursuant to the final rule, SSA has issued SSR 24-2p,  Titles II and XVI: How\\nWe Evaluate Past Relevant Work, effec tive June 22, 2024, which rescinds\\nSSR 86-8, and rescinds  and replaces SSR 82-61 and SSR 82-62.  The purpose\\nof the new ruling  is to explain how SSA determines whether  an individual\\nretai ns the residual functional capacity  (RFC) to perform the demands of their\\npast relevant work and to explain the policy set forth in SSA’s regulations so\\nthat those regulations will be consistently  applied.   See SSR 24-2p, 2024 WL\\n3291790 (S.S.A. J une 6, 2024); 89 F ed. Reg . 48479 (J une 6, 2024).  \\nAccor ding to SSR 24-2p, the relevant period for PRW  is generally  measured\\nfrom the date of the SSA’s determination or decision on a claim.  However, in\\nsome situations, the relevan t period is measured from an earlier date. This\\nruling  includes a table that provides g uidelines for common scenarios.  \\n3.The ALJ erred in failing  to comply  with SSR 24-2p, which applies to this\\ncase.\\nApplicable law .  SSA will apply  SSR 24-2p on and after its applicable date of\\nJune 22, 2024, in any case in which the agency  makes a determination or\\ndecision.  If a court reverses a final decision and remands a case for further\\nadministrative proceeding s after the applicable date of  SSR 24-2p, SSA will\\napply  this ruling to the entire period at issue in the decision made after the\\ncourt’s remand.  \\n4.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant did not work\\nlong  enoug h to learn how to do the work.\\n62\\n5.The ALJ conceded in his/h er decision at step one of the sequential evaluation\\nprocess that the claimant was not engaged in substantial gainful activity , and\\ntherefore erred in finding  that the claimant can return to this work.\\n6.The ALJ’s finding  that claimant engaged in past relevant work  was not\\nsupported by substantial evidence, which showed that claimant only did work\\nthat started and stopped in a period of fewer  than 30 calendar days during  the\\npast five-y ear period.\\nApplicable law .  SSR 24-2p defines PRW  as work that was performed: \\n•within the past five y ears; \\n•was substantial g ainful activity  (SGA) and \\n•lasted long  enoug h for the individual to learn to do preform the work.  \\nSee 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1560(b)(1)(i)) and 416.960(b)(1)(i).  According  to SSR\\n24-2p, “long  enoug h to learn” means that:\\nThe individual gained sufficient job experience to learn the techniques,\\nacquire information, and develop the facility  needed for averag e\\nperfo rmance in the job. The length of time this would take depends on the\\nnature and complex ity of the work, which may be expressed as specific\\nvocational preparation (SVP).\\nSSR 24-2p provides that work is not PRW  if it the work started and stopped in\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s, defined as:\\na period of 30 consecu tive days, including  weekends, starting  from the\\nfirst day of work. We generally  do not consider the total number of hours\\nor days worked during  that period, or whether the work was full-time or\\npart-time. The 30 calendar days require ment is separate from the\\nconsideration of SGA or whether an individual worked long enoug h to\\nlearn  how to do the work, althoug h the 30 calendar days may count toward\\nthe time needed for an individual to learn to do the work.\\n Moreover, if a claimant was self-employed or an independent contractor, SSA\\nwill consider whether he or she was engaged in the same type of work for 30\\ncalendar days even if individual work assig nments or contracts each lasted\\nfewer than 30 calendar days.  Examples of different scenarios are provided in\\nSSR 24-2p, including  in footnote 14, which explains PRW  includes “gig\\necon omy” work such as an individual who completed 20 different shopping\\ntrips for a grocery delivery  service over a period of 30 calendar days or more\\nbecause the individual did the same job for at least 30 calendar days even\\nthoug h each individual shopping  trip started and stopped within a period of\\nfewer than 30 calendar day s. \\nSSR 24-2p provides examples interpr eting the 30 calendar day requirement.  \\nThe ruling  lists the following  two ex amples:\\n63\\nExample 1: On March 1, 2023, an individual began working a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was March 30, 2023. The individual worked at the job for 30\\ncalendar days because they started work on March 1, 2023, and their last\\nday of work was on March 30, 2023. In this situation, the job would\\nqualify  as PRW  if it was perfor med at the SGA level and during  the 5-year\\nrelevant work period.\\nExample  2: On February  1, 2023, an individual began working  a job that\\nrequires only a brief demonstration to learn. The individual’s last day of\\nwork was February  28, 2023. Althoug h the individual held the job long\\nenoug h to learn to do it, the work started and stopped in fewer than 30\\ncalendar days.  In this situation, the job would not qualify  as PRW , even if\\nit was performed at the SGA level and during  the 5-year relevant  work\\nperiod. \\n7.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to her past relevant work as she\\nactually  performed it (or as genera lly performed) is not based on substantial\\nevidence.   \\nApplicable law:  There are two methods used to determine whether a\\nclaimant can perform his or her PRW  – whether the claima nt can perform the\\nwork as “actually  performed” or as “generally  performed in the national\\neconomy .”  SSR 24-2p states that “[a]s they actually performed the work”\\nlooks to whethe r the claimant retains the “RFC to perform the particular\\nfunctional demands peculiar to the work the individual did.” \\nIn evaluating  work as “generally  performed  in the national economy ,” SSA\\nlooks to whether the claimant “retains the capacity  to perform the\\noccupation’s functional deman ds as ordinarily  required throug hout the\\nnation al economy ,” based on descriptions of occupations from reliable\\nsources of job information to determine how occupati ons are generally\\nperformed. A vocational witness may also provide information about  how an\\noccupation is generally  perfor med in the national economy .  SSR 24-2p also\\nexplains:\\nIf the individual cannot meet the functional demands actually  requir ed in\\nthe former job but can meet the functional demands as generally  required\\nthroug hout the economy , we will find the individual able to perform PRW\\nand not disabled.\\nIn determining  whether a claimant can perfor m a job as “actually  performed,”\\nthe claimant’s job may have involved functional demands that are different\\nfrom those generally  required for the occupation throug hout the national\\neconomy .  If the claimant cannot meet the functional demands actually\\nrequired in the former job but can meet the functional demands as generally\\nrequired throug hout the economy , SSA will find the individual able to\\nperform PRW  and is not disabled.\\n64\\nSSR 24-2p provides that statements by the individual about their past work\\nare generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and mental\\ndemands of such work. However, if individual cannot provide this\\ninformation,  with the individual’s permission, SSA will attempt to get it from\\ntheir employ er or another person who knows about the individual’s work,\\nsuch as a family  member or a co-worker. \\nSSA will ask the claimant to describe all of the work perfor med in the last 5\\nyears (unless the job started and stopped  in fewer than 30 calendar days),\\nincluding :\\n•the dates they  worked;\\n•the duties they  performed;\\n•any tools, machinery , and equipment they  used; and \\n•the amount of walking, standing , sitting , lifting , and carry ing the\\nindividual did during  the workday , as well as any other physical or\\nmental demands of their work.\\n \\n8.While the ALJ summaril y concluded that the claimant can return to his/her\\npast relevant work, s/he provided no specific findings  or analy sis regarding\\nthe phy sical and mental demands of this work, as required by SSR 24-2p.\\n9.The ALJ did not fulfill his/her duty, under SSR 24-2p, to develop the record\\nregarding  the claimant’s past work.\\nApplicable law.  SSR 24-2p provides that statements by a claimant about past\\nwork is generally  sufficient for determining  the skill level and physical and\\nmental demands of such work.  However, if the claimant cannot provide this\\ninformation, with the claimant’s permission, SSA will attempt get it from\\nothers, such as a family  member or a co-worker. SSA will ask the claimant to\\ndescribe all of the work perfor med in the last 5 years (unless the job started\\nand stopped in fewer than 30 calendar days), including  the dates they worked,\\nthe duties they performed, any tools, machinery , and equipment they used and\\nthe amount of walking , standing , sitting , lifting , and carrying the individual\\ndid during  the workday , as well as any other physical or mental demands of\\ntheir work.\\nSSR 24-2p provides that SSA determines whether an individual can perform\\ntheir past relevant work (PRW ) by considering whether the individual retains\\nthe RFC to meet the functional demands of any of their PRW , as they actual ly\\nperformed it, or as it is generally  performed in the national economy . This\\nRuling  explains the information SSA needs to make this determination:\\nTo determine whether an individual can perform PRW , we need\\ninformation about the physical and mental demands of PRW , particularly\\n65\\nas relevant to the individual’s RF C. This may  include:\\n \\n•detailed information about streng th, manipulative ability , mental\\ndemands, and other job requirements; \\n•the dates work was performed; \\n•tools and machines used;\\n•the ex tent of supervision required, and\\n•a description of tasks and responsibilities.\\nIf more than one job was performed during  the 5-year period, we will request\\nseparate descriptions of each  job the individual performed during  the relevant\\nperiod.\\nAccording  to SSR 24-2p, determination of the individual’s ability to do PRW\\nrequires careful consideration of:\\n•the individual’s statements as to which past work requirements can no\\nlong er be met and the reason(s) for their inability  to meet those\\nrequirements;\\n•the individual’s RF C;  and\\n•in some cases, supplementary  or corrob orative information from other\\nsources on the requirements of the work as actually  performed by the\\nindividual or as g enerally  performed in the economy .\\nThe ALJ’s decision that an individual is not disabled, based on the ability  to\\nperform PRW , must contain adequate rationale and finding s of fact. SSR 24-\\n2p provides:\\nA determination or decision that an individual is not disabled, based on\\ntheir ability  to perform at least one job or occupation that is PRW  at step\\nfour of the sequential evaluation process, must contain adequate rationale\\nand finding s.\\nSpecifically , in finding  that an individua l has the capacity  to perform PRW ,\\nthe determination or decision must:\\n•establish the individual’s RF C;\\n•identify  the PRW  the individual can do;\\n•consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either as the\\nindividual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\n66\\nperformed in the national economy ; and\\n•find that the individual’s RFC establishes capacity  to perform the\\nPRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .\\nUnder SSR 24-2p, the ALJ’s decision must contain adequate rationale and\\nfindings which “consider the physical and mental demands of the PRW  either\\nas the individual actually  performed the job or as the occupation is generally\\nperformed in the national economy .”  \\n10.The ALJ misclassified the streng th requirements of the claimant’s past\\nrelevant work by the lightest duties performed, when, in fact, it was actually  a\\ncomposite job which also entailed more strenuous duties.\\n   11.The ALJ erred in not recognizing that the claimant performed a  “composite\\njob” which entailed  the duties of two jobs as discussed in POMS DI\\n25005.020(B ) and thus committed legal error in finding  that s/he can return to\\nthe least strenuous of his/her past duties. \\nApplicable law:  The regulations provide that, after comparing  the claimant’s\\nresidual functional capacity  with “the physical and mental demands of [his or\\nher] past relevant work,” if the claimant “can still do this kind of work,” the\\nclaimant is not disabled.  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(f), 416.920(f).  A composite\\njob in one which entails duties which are performed at different exertional\\nlevels.  \\nPOMS DI 25005.020 addresses past relevant work as performed by a claimant\\nand discusses composite jobs:\\nComposite jobs have significant elements of two or more occupations and\\nas such, have no counterpart in the DOT.\\n•The claimant’s PRW  may be a composite job if it takes multiple DOT\\noccupations to locate the main duties of the PRW  as described by the\\nclaimant.\\n•If you determine that PRW  was a composite job, you must explain\\nwhy.\\n•When comparing  the claimant’s RFC to a composite job as the\\nclaimant performed it, find the claimant capable of performing  the\\ncomposite job only  if he or she can perform all parts of the job.\\n•A composite job does not have a DOT counterpart, so do not evaluate\\nit at the part of step 4 considering  work “as generally  performed in the\\nnational economy .”\\n67\\n•At step 5 of sequential evaluatio n, a claimant may be able to use skills\\nhe or she gained from a skilled or semiski lled composite job to adjust\\nto other work. See Transferability  of Skills Assessment (TSA), DI\\n25015.017, for instructions on how to assess transferability  of skills.\\n12.The ALJ erred in not addressing  the impact of the claimant’s inability  to\\ntolerate stress on his/her abilit y to perform his/her past relevant highly\\nstressful work, as discussed in SSR 85-15 and SSR 24-2p. \\nApplicable law: SSR 24-2p provides that in determining  whether an\\nindivid ual is able to perform PRW , the ALJ may need to obtain detailed\\ninformation regarding  the work’s “mental demands, and other  job\\nrequirements” and the ALJ’s decision must consider the “mental demands of\\nthe PRW  either as the individual actually  performed the job or as the\\noccupation is g enerally  performed in the national economy .”  \\nSSR 85-15 acknowledg es that “since mental illness is defined and\\ncharacteriz ed by maladaptive behavior, it is not unusual that the mentally\\nimpaired have difficulty  accomm odating to the demands of work and work-\\nlike setting s. Determining  whether these individuals will be able to adapt to\\nthe demands or “stress” of the workplace is often extremely  difficult.” The\\nruling  states it is “not intended to set out any presumptive limitations for\\ndisorders, but to emphasiz e the impor tance of thoroug hness in evaluation on\\nan individualiz ed basis.”  SSR 85-15 provides examples of how reactions to\\nthe demands of work stress can affect the ability  to perform PRW :\\nThe reaction to the demands of work (stress) is highly individualiz ed, and\\nmental  illness is characteriz ed by adverse responses to seeming ly trivial\\ncircumstances. The mentally  impaired may cease to functio n effectively\\nwhen facing  such demands as getting  to work regularly , having  their\\nperformance supervised, and remaining  in the workplace for a full day. A\\nperson may become panicked and develop palpitations, shortness of\\nbreath, or feel faint while riding  in an elevator; another may experie nce\\nterror and begin to hallucinate when approached by a strang er asking  a\\nquestion. Thus, the mentally  impaired may have difficulty  meetin g the\\nrequirements of even so-called ‘low-stress’ jobs.\\nBecause response to the demands of work is highly individuali zed, the\\nskill level of a position is not necessarily  related to the difficulty  an\\nindividual will have in meeting  the demands of the job. A claimant’s\\ncondition may make performance of an unskilled job as difficult as an\\nobjectively  more demanding  job. For example, a busboy  need only  clear\\ndishes from tables. But an individual with a severe mental disorder may\\nfind unmanag eable the demands of making  sure that he removes all the\\ndishes, does not drop them, and gets the table  cleared promptly  for the\\nwaiter or waitress. Similarly , an individual who cannot tolerate being\\nsupervised may not be able to work even in the absence of close\\nsupervision; the knowledge  that one’s work is being  judg ed and evaluated,\\n68\\neven when the supervision is remote or indirect, can be intolerable for\\nsome mentally  impaired perso ns. Any impairment-related limitations\\ncreated by an individual’s response to demands of work, however, must be\\nreflected in the RF C assessment.\\nId. (emphasis in orig inal).\\n13.Given the ALJ’s finding  that the claimant has the RFC to perform  sedentary\\n[or light] work, his/her finding  that s/he is able to return to his/her past\\nrelevant work as a *** [state job], which is classified as light [or medium]\\nwork both as s/he performed it and as it was performed in the national\\neconomy , cannot be sustained.\\n14.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her  past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, conflicts with the AL J’s own RF C  finding s.\\n15.The ALJ erred in classify ing the claimant’s past releva nt work as a *** [state\\njob] as “light” [or “sedentary ”] work when it was, in fact, “medium” [or\\n“light” work] , both as he/she performed the work and as performed in the\\nnational economy  according  to the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles.\\nApplicable law:  SSR 24-2p provi des that a claimant is considered “not\\ndisabled” who retains the RFC to perform either the actual functional\\ndemands and job duties of his/her particular past relevant job or the functional\\ndemands and job duties of the occupation as it is generally  required by\\nemploy ers throug hout the national economy .\\n16.The ALJ’s finding  that the claimant can return to his/her past relevant work,\\nas it was performed, directly  conflicts with the VE’s testimony , which the\\nALJ essentially  disreg arded in his/her decision.\\nH.STEP 5 - AB ILITY TO PERFORM OTHER WORK\\n1.As the claimant lacks any transferable skills, s/he cannot, in fact, perform\\nsemi-skilled work as a [ state job]  as the AL J found.\\nApplicable law:  Skills are acquired in a claimant’s past relevant work or in\\nrecent education that provides for direct entry into skilled work. SSR 00-4p. \\nThe Commissioner has specif ically determined that “unskilled work\\ncorresponds to an SVP of 1-2; semi-skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 3-\\n4; and skilled work corresponds to an SVP of 5-9 in the [Dictionary  of\\nOccupational Titles] ” and these “regulatory  definitions of skill levels are\\ncontrolling .” Id.\\nFurthermore, as set forth in Social Security  Ruing  83-10:\\nthe [ a]bility  to perform skilled or semiskilled work depends on the\\n69\\npresence of acquired skills which may  be transferred to such work from\\npast job ex perience above the unskilled level or the presence of recently\\ncompleted education which allows for direct entry  into skilled or\\nsemiskilled work . . . .\\nThis Ruling  further explains that in order to find that a claimant has\\ntransferable skills, the individual “must have performed work which is above\\nthe unskilled level of complex ity, must have identifiable skills, and must be\\nable to use these skills in specific skilled or semiskilled occupations within his\\nor her RF C.”\\nA claimant who cannot use his or her skills in other jobs  is considered to have\\nan unskilled work backg round.  “If you have acquired skills throug h your past\\nwork, we consider you to have these work skills unless you cannot use them\\nin other skilled or semi-skilled work.”  20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1565, 416.965.  And\\nif the claimant cannot use these skills, the work backg round “is considered the\\nsame as unskilled.”  Id.   \\n2.Since the ALJ determined that the claimant could perform semi-skilled work,\\nthe ALJ pursuant to SSR 83-11 and SSR 83-14 must cite examples  of jobs\\nthat the claimant  could perform and the incidence of such jobs in the national\\neconomy .\\nApplicable law: Social Security  Ruling  83-11 provides that in those cases\\nwhere a claimant’s past relevant work included one or more skilled or semi-\\nskilled jobs and transferability of skills is material, the “finding  of fact\\nrequires identification of the work skills, examples of specific skilled or\\nsemiskilled occupations within the person’s RFC to which s/he or she can\\ntransfer skills (if any), and a statement of the incidence of such jobs in the\\nregion in which the person lives or in several regions of the country .”  Id.  The\\nALJ must ask the vocational witness to identify  examples of appropriate jobs\\nand to state the incidence of such  jobs in the national economy .  20 C.F.R. §§\\n404.1566, 416.966.  \\nSSR 83-14, applicable when a claimant has a combination of exertional and\\nnonex ertional impairments, provides that:\\n[w]henever a vocational resource is used and an individual is found to be\\nnot disabled, the determinatio n or decision will include (1) citations of\\nexamples of occupations/job s the person can do functionally  and\\nvocationally  and (2) a statement of the incidence of such work in the\\nregion in which the individual resides or in several reg ions of the country .\\nId. (emphasis added).\\n3.Since the testimony  of the VE supports a finding  that there is no work in the\\nnational economy  upon a proper consideration of all of the claimant’s\\nlimitations, the Appeals Council should award benefits.\\n70\\n4.The Appeals Council should find the claimant disabled based on the\\ntestimony  of the vocational ex pert.\\n5.The evidence of record documents that the claimant is disabled and unable to\\nperform the basic mental demands of unskilled work as described in SSR 85-\\n15, warranting  an award of benefits.\\nApplicable law : As set forth in SSR 85-15:\\nThe basic menta l demands of competitive, remunerative, unskilled work\\ninclude the abilities (on a sustained basis) to understand, carry  out, and\\nremember simple instructions; to respond appropriately  to supe rvision,\\ncoworkers, and usual work situations; and to deal with changes in a\\nroutine work setting .  A substantial loss of ability  to meet any of these\\nbasic work-related activities would severely  limit the potential\\noccupational base.  This, in turn, would justify  a finding  of disability\\nbecause even favorable age, education, or work experien ce will not offset\\nsuch a severely  limited occupational base.\\nExample 1:  A person whose vocational factors of age, education, and\\nwork experience would ordinarily  be considered favorable (i.e., very\\nyoung  age, unive rsity education, and highly skilled work experience)\\nwould have a severely limited occupational base if he or she has a mental\\nimpairment which causes a substantial loss of ability  to respond\\nappropriately  to supervision, coworkers, and usual work situations.  A\\nfinding  of disability  would be appropriate.\\nSimilarly , SSR 96-9p states the following  regarding  the mental demands of\\nsedentary  work:\\nA substantial loss of ability  to meet any one of several basic work-related\\nactivities on a sustaine d basis (i.e., 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, or an\\nequivalent work schedule), will substantially  erode the unskilled sedentary\\noccupational base and would justify a finding  of disability .  These mental\\nactiviti es are generally  required by competitive, remunerative, unskilled\\nwork:\\n•Understanding , remembering , and carry ing out simple instructions.\\n•Making  judgments that are commensurate with the functions of\\nunskilled work – i.e., simple work- related decisions.\\n•Responding  appropriately  to supervision, co-workers, and usual\\nwork situations.\\n•Dealing  with chang es in a routine work setting .\\nPOMS DI 25020.010, addressing  mental limitations, addresses “substantial\\n71\\nloss” as follows: \\n“Substantial loss” cannot be precisely  defined.  It does not necessarily\\nrelate to any particular adjective, number, or percent age.  In practical\\nterms, an individual has a substantial loss of ability  to perfo rm a basic\\nmental activity  when he or she cannot perform the particular activit y in\\nregular, competitive employ ment but, at best, could do so only in a\\nsheltered work setting  where special considerations and attentio n are\\nprovided. This requires professional judgment, on the basis of the\\nevidence in file in each case. The impairment in a claim of this type may\\nmeet or equal the listed medical criteria.  Therefore, before making  a\\ndetermination that includes vocational evaluation, the adjudicat or should\\ndiscuss the case with a psychiatrist or psycholog ist to learn whether a\\nsignificant part of the evidence had been previously  overlooked or\\nunderrated. . . .\\nEXCEP TION : In a few rare instances where a person’s vocatio nal\\nprofile is extrem ely adverse (e.g., closely  approaching  retiremen t age,\\nlimited education or less, and essentially  a lifetime commitment to a field\\nof unskilled  work that is now precluded by a mental impairment), a\\nfinding  of “disabled” may be appropri ate. (This would be adjudicated\\nunder the Lifetime Com mitments Special Medical-Vocational Profile. See\\nDI 25010.001B .3.).\\nId. (Emphasis in original).  See generally  the following  POMS addressing\\nmental impairments: DI 25015.020, 25020.001-25020.01 5, 25025.001, and\\n25025.030.\\n6.The ALJ erred in relying on the testimony  of a vocational expert which rebuts\\nthe finding  of disability directed by the Medical-Vocational Guidelines\\n(Grids).\\nApplicabl e law:  The Grids rules are conclusive and cannot be rebutted by the\\ntestimony  of a vocational expert.  See SSR 83-5a.  In SSR 83-5a, the Appeals\\nCouncil reversed an ALJ’s decision that determined that the Grid rules\\nconstituted “rebuttable presumptions” of disability  that could be rebutted by\\nthe testimony  of a vocational expert.  Even thoug h Grid Rule 201.10  directed\\na finding  of disability , the ALJ had determined that such a conclusion was a\\n“rebuttable presumption” of disability  and, instead, relied on the testimony  of\\na vocational testimony  that there were jobs the claimant could perform.  In\\nreversing  the ALJ’s decision, the Commissioner pointed out that the preamble\\nto the Grids provides that:\\n“Where the finding s of fact made with respect to a particula r individual’s\\nvocational factors and residual functional capacity  coincide with all of the\\ncriteria of a particular rule, the rule directs a conclusion as to whether the\\nindividual is or is not disabled. However, each of these finding s of fact is\\nsubject to rebuttal and the individual may present evidence to refute such\\n72\\nfinding s.”\\nId. (quoting  Grids § 200.00(a)). The Commissioner noted that since “there is\\nno provision in either the Act or the regulations for an ALJ, as a trier of fact\\nfor SSA, to rebut the conclusion directed by SSA’s regulations, “the ALJ’s\\nrebuttal of the direct ed conclusion of disability  was inconsistent with both the\\nAct and its implementing  regulations.” Id.\\n7.The ALJ erred in relying on the VE’s testimony  that considered whether the\\nclaimant ’s need for [state limitation]  could be reasonably  accommodated by\\nemploy ers in deny ing this case.\\nApplicable law:  The Supreme Court has held that the issue of reasonable\\naccommodation by employ ers is not relevant in a Social Security  case.  See\\nCleveland v. Policy Management Systems, et al, 526 U.S. 795 (1999).16  In\"\n",

      "Yes, there are several laws and rulings that can assist your blind client, particularly in the context of disability claims. Here are some key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Social Security Rulings (SSR)**: SSR 18-02p specifically addresses blindness claims, ensuring that individuals with visual impairments receive appropriate consideration in the disability determination process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Eligibility for Social Security Disability Benefits**: To qualify, individuals must have a medically determinable impairment that significantly limits their ability to perform basic work activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Failure to Follow Prescribed Treatment**: If an individual has not followed prescribed treatment, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will evaluate whether adherence would have restored their ability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA). Acceptable reasons for not following treatment can include financial constraints or medical disagreements.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Past Relevant Work (PRW)**: The evaluation period for considering past work has been reduced from 15 years to 5 years, which can benefit individuals with disabilities by focusing on more recent work experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems, et al.**: This Supreme Court case clarified that claims for Social Security disability benefits do not preclude individuals from pursuing claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The two claims can coexist, as the ADA considers the ability to perform job functions with reasonable accommodation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)**: The SSA evaluates whether an individual's work activity is comparable to that of unimpaired individuals, considering time, energy, skills, and responsibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Documentation Requirements**: Detailed documentation is necessary to support claims regarding SGA, including descriptions of work performed by unimpaired individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Unsuccessful Work Attempts (UWA)**: Work that is discontinued or reduced below SGA level due to impairment within six months may be classified as an UWA, which does not demonstrate the ability to engage in SGA.\n",
      "\n",
      "These laws and rulings collectively aim to provide a fair framework for assessing the eligibility of individuals with blindness for Social Security disability benefits, enhancing their chances of obtaining the necessary support.\n"

INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nThis brief is submitted on behalf of Plaintiff [Client Name], a blind individual, who brings this action against Defendant [Defendant Name] for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant has failed to provide adequate accessibility measures, resulting in discrimination against the Plaintiff and other individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**II. FACTS OF THE CASE**\\n\\n1. **Background of the Plaintiff**: Plaintiff [Client Name] is a legally blind individual who relies on assistive technologies and tactile cues to navigate public spaces and access information.\\n\\n2. **Defendant's Business**: Defendant [Defendant Name] operates a public facility located at [insert address], which is open to the general public and provides [describe services offered, e.g., retail, dining, entertainment].\\n\\n3. **Accessibility Issues**: On [insert date], Plaintiff visited Defendant's facility and encountered multiple barriers that impeded access, including:\\n   - Lack of Braille signage and tactile maps.\\n   - Inaccessible digital interfaces (e.g., websites, kiosks) that do not support screen readers.\\n   - Absence of trained staff to assist individuals with visual impairments.\\n\\n4. **Plaintiff's Experience**: During the visit, Plaintiff was unable to navigate the facility independently, leading to frustration and exclusion from services that were readily available to sighted individuals.\\n\\n5. **Prior Complaints**: Plaintiff has previously raised concerns regarding accessibility with Defendant, but no substantial changes have been made to address these issues.\\n\\n**III. LEGAL STANDARDS**\\n\\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places open to the general public. The relevant provisions include:\\n\\n1. **Title III of the ADA**: This title mandates that public accommodations must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) states that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.\\n\\n2. **Accessibility Standards**: The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) provide specific requirements for accessible design, including the provision of accessible signage, communication aids, and the removal of barriers to access.\\n\\n3. **Discrimination Definition**: Discrimination under the ADA includes not only overt exclusion but also the failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**IV. ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING PLAINTIFF'S POSITION**\\n\\n1. **Failure to Provide Accessible Facilities**: Defendant's facility does not comply with the ADAAG, as it lacks essential accessibility features such as Braille signage and tactile maps. This failure constitutes a direct violation of Title III of the ADA.\\n\\n2. **Inaccessible Digital Interfaces**: The Defendant's website and any digital kiosks are not compatible with screen readers, which are essential for blind individuals to access information. This lack of accessibility is discriminatory and violates the ADA's requirement for equal access to services.\\n\\n3. **Negligence in Addressing Complaints**: Defendant's inaction in response to Plaintiff's prior complaints demonstrates a pattern of neglect regarding accessibility obligations. The ADA requires public accommodations to take proactive steps to ensure accessibility, and the Defendant's failure to do so constitutes discrimination.\\n\\n4. **Emotional and Psychological Impact**: The barriers faced by the Plaintiff not only hinder physical access but also result in emotional distress and a sense of exclusion from society. This impact is a significant aspect of the discrimination experienced by individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**V. CONCLUSION**\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court find in favor of the Plaintiff, declare that Defendant has violated the ADA, and order Defendant to take immediate steps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for the discrimination experienced and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\\n\\n**Respectfully submitted,**\\n\\n[Your Name]  \\n[Your Law Firm]  \\n[Address]  \\n[City, State, Zip]  \\n[Phone Number]  \\n[Email Address]  \\n[Attorney for Plaintiff]  \\n\\n**Dated: [Insert Date]**\",\n",

INTRODUCTION**\\n\\nThis brief is submitted on behalf of Plaintiff [Client Name], a blind individual, who brings this action against Defendant [Defendant Name] for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant has failed to provide adequate accessibility measures, resulting in discrimination against the Plaintiff and other individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**II. FACTS OF THE CASE**\\n\\n1. **Background of the Plaintiff**: Plaintiff [Client Name] is a legally blind individual who relies on assistive technologies and tactile cues to navigate public spaces and access information.\\n\\n2. **Defendant's Business**: Defendant [Defendant Name] operates a public facility located at [insert address], which is open to the general public and provides [describe services offered, e.g., retail, dining, entertainment].\\n\\n3. **Accessibility Issues**: On [insert date], Plaintiff visited Defendant's facility and encountered multiple barriers that impeded access, including:\\n   - Lack of Braille signage and tactile maps.\\n   - Inaccessible digital interfaces (e.g., websites, kiosks) that do not support screen readers.\\n   - Absence of trained staff to assist individuals with visual impairments.\\n\\n4. **Plaintiff's Experience**: During the visit, Plaintiff was unable to navigate the facility independently, leading to frustration and exclusion from services that were readily available to sighted individuals.\\n\\n5. **Prior Complaints**: Plaintiff has previously raised concerns regarding accessibility with Defendant, but no substantial changes have been made to address these issues.\\n\\n**III. LEGAL STANDARDS**\\n\\nThe ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places open to the general public. The relevant provisions include:\\n\\n1. **Title III of the ADA**: This title mandates that public accommodations must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) states that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.\\n\\n2. **Accessibility Standards**: The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) provide specific requirements for accessible design, including the provision of accessible signage, communication aids, and the removal of barriers to access.\\n\\n3. **Discrimination Definition**: Discrimination under the ADA includes not only overt exclusion but also the failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**IV. ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING PLAINTIFF'S POSITION**\\n\\n1. **Failure to Provide Accessible Facilities**: Defendant's facility does not comply with the ADAAG, as it lacks essential accessibility features such as Braille signage and tactile maps. This failure constitutes a direct violation of Title III of the ADA.\\n\\n2. **Inaccessible Digital Interfaces**: The Defendant's website and any digital kiosks are not compatible with screen readers, which are essential for blind individuals to access information. This lack of accessibility is discriminatory and violates the ADA's requirement for equal access to services.\\n\\n3. **Negligence in Addressing Complaints**: Defendant's inaction in response to Plaintiff's prior complaints demonstrates a pattern of neglect regarding accessibility obligations. The ADA requires public accommodations to take proactive steps to ensure accessibility, and the Defendant's failure to do so constitutes discrimination.\\n\\n4. **Emotional and Psychological Impact**: The barriers faced by the Plaintiff not only hinder physical access but also result in emotional distress and a sense of exclusion from society. This impact is a significant aspect of the discrimination experienced by individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**V. CONCLUSION**\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court find in favor of the Plaintiff, declare that Defendant has violated the ADA, and order Defendant to take immediate steps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for the discrimination experienced and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\\n\\n**Respectfully submitted,**\\n\\n[Your Name]  \\n[Your Law Firm]  \\n[Address]  \\n[City, State, Zip]  \\n[Phone Number]  \\n[Email Address]  \\n[Attorney for Plaintiff]  \\n\\n**Dated: [Insert Date]**\"\n",

The relevant provisions include:\\n\\n1. **Title III of the ADA**: This title mandates that public accommodations must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) states that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.\\n\\n2. **Accessibility Standards**: The ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) provide specific requirements for accessible design, including the provision of accessible signage, communication aids, and the removal of barriers to access.\\n\\n3. **Discrimination Definition**: Discrimination under the ADA includes not only overt exclusion but also the failure to make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, or procedures when such modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, facilities, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**IV. ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING PLAINTIFF'S POSITION**\\n\\n1. **Failure to Provide Accessible Facilities**: Defendant's facility does not comply with the ADAAG, as it lacks essential accessibility features such as Braille signage and tactile maps. This failure constitutes a direct violation of Title III of the ADA.\\n\\n2. **Inaccessible Digital Interfaces**: The Defendant's website and any digital kiosks are not compatible with screen readers, which are essential for blind individuals to access information. This lack of accessibility is discriminatory and violates the ADA's requirement for equal access to services.\\n\\n3. **Negligence in Addressing Complaints**: Defendant's inaction in response to Plaintiff's prior complaints demonstrates a pattern of neglect regarding accessibility obligations. The ADA requires public accommodations to take proactive steps to ensure accessibility, and the Defendant's failure to do so constitutes discrimination.\\n\\n4. **Emotional and Psychological Impact**: The barriers faced by the Plaintiff not only hinder physical access but also result in emotional distress and a sense of exclusion from society. This impact is a significant aspect of the discrimination experienced by individuals with disabilities.\\n\\n**V. CONCLUSION**\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court find in favor of the Plaintiff, declare that Defendant has violated the ADA, and order Defendant to take immediate steps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards. Additionally, Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages for the discrimination experienced and any other relief the Court deems just and proper.\\n\\n**Respectfully submitted,**\\n\\n[Your Name]  \\n[Your Law Firm]  \\n[Address]  \\n[City, State, Zip]  \\n[Phone Number]  \\n[Email Address]  \\n[Attorney for Plaintiff]  \\n\\n**Dated: [Insert Date]**\\n\\n--- \\n\\nFeel free to customize the placeholders with the relevant information for your case.\\nSystem: Given the conversation above, who should act next?

      "   - This law mandates that reasonable accommodations be made to ensure equal access to educational and employment opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)**\n",
      "   - IDEA ensures that children with disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) tailored to their individual needs.\n",
      "   - It requires schools to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for each eligible child.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fair Housing Act (FHA)**\n",
      "   - The FHA prohibits discrimination in housing based on disability and requires reasonable modifications to be made to accommodate individuals with disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Legal Protections**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Right to Reasonable Accommodations**: Individuals with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations in the workplace, educational settings, and public services to ensure equal access and opportunity.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Protection from Retaliation**: Individuals who assert their rights under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, or other disability rights laws are protected from retaliation by employers or service providers.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Filing Complaints**: Individuals who believe their rights have been violated may file complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), or relevant state agencies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Legal Action**: Individuals may pursue private lawsuits against entities that violate disability rights laws, seeking remedies such as compensatory damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals with disabilities possess a robust framework of legal rights and protections designed to promote equality and prevent discrimination. It is essential for disabled persons to be aware of these rights and the mechanisms available for enforcement to ensure their full participation in society.\n",
